        "content": "Darron Gibson\u2019s first goal for Everton gave his old team Manchester United a massive boost as English Premier League leaders Manchester City crashed to a 1-0 defeat at Goodison Park on Tuesday. The Northern Ireland midfielder\u2019s deflected shot in the 60th minute gave David Moyes\u2019 team a lead which they held on to despite mounting City pressure at the end of the match.  The result meant second-placed United joined City on 54 points from 23 games after the champions beat Stoke 2-0, but Roberto Mancini\u2019s side have a superior goal difference. Everton\u2019s Argentine striker Denis Stracqualursi had an effort headed off the line by Joleon Lescott five minutes into the match, and soon after Samir Nasri hit the bar at the other end.  The hosts paraded new striker Nikica Jelavic during the halftime interval before Gibson \u2013 who also joined the Merseyside club this month \u2013 unleashed a drive from the edge of the area which flew past a rooted Joe Hart.  Deadline-day transfers: A football agent\u2019s inside story Manchester United made the most of the slip up with a comfortable home win over eighth-placed Stoke City despite being without several first-team regulars.  A penalty in either half \u2013 converted by strikers Javier Hernandez and Dimitar Berbatov \u2013 saw Alex Ferguson\u2019s men keep the pressure on City.  Tottenham Hotspur beat Wigan 3-1 at White Hart Lane to maintain their grip on third place, as Gareth Bale scored twice.  The Wales winger\u2019s volley put the home side ahead after 29 minutes, and Croatia midfielder Luka Modric added a second five minutes later.  Bale got his second of the night in the 64th minute before Wigan substitute James McArthur grabbed a consolation goal 10 minutes from time.  Fourth-placed Chelsea lost further ground on their north London rivals after dropping points away to Swansea. Former Chelsea midfielder Scott Sinclair scored a stunning goal to put Swansea ahead but Jose Bosingwa spared Chelsea blushes with an injury-time equalizer after Ashley Cole was sent off for two bookable offenses.   Andy Carroll marked the first anniversary of his signing for Liverpool with a much-needed goal in a 3-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. The former Newcastle striker, who cost Liverpool \u00a335 million ($55 million) in the last January transfer window, opened the Reds\u2019 account prodding in a ball at the far post in the 53rd minute. A goal from strike partner Craig Bellamy followed eight minutes later with Dirk Kuyt adding a third 12 minutes from the end as Liverpool moved up to fifth above Arsenal \u2013 who travel to Bolton on Wednesday.   Meanwhile in Italy, Tuesday\u2019s Serie A fixture between leaders Juventus and mid-table Parma was called off less than an hour before kickoff because of heavy snow. "

        "content": "Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s list of honors are modest compared to the achievements of Europe\u2019s top football clubs, but what the French side lacks in history is made up for in ambition. Since being taken over by Qatar Sports Investments in May 2011, significant steps have been taken, on and off the pitch, to make sure PSG can challenge for major titles \u2013 and new manager Carlo Ancelotti is under no illusions about what is expected of him. \u201cThis club does not have a big history like Milan, like other clubs like Manchester United, like Real Madrid, like Barcelona,\u201d the 52-year-old, who replaced Antoine Kombouare in December, told CNN. \u201cThe aim is to reach that kind of level.\u201d Formed in 1970 as a merger between Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain, PSG\u2019s last Ligue 1 crown \u2013 and only second overall \u2013 came in 1994.  Can Qatari cash make PSG a football force? That was followed two years later by a European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup triumph but, added to a collection of domestic knockout competition trophies, the haul falls well short of what new PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi expects. Ancelotti has won Europe\u2019s top club competition as both player and coach with AC Milan, and is well aware of Al-Khelaifi\u2019s vision for PSG and the need for him to deliver Champions League football to the Parc des Princes next season. \u201cHis objective is very clear,\u201d the former Chelsea manager said. \u201cTo build a good image of the club, to build one of the top clubs in Europe.   \u201cHe wants my experience, my knowledge to help the club and the team to improve quickly. He has a fantastic passion for football and he knows everything.\u201d  Putting the pride back into PSG PSG\u2019s spending spree so far includes the signing of Argentina playmaker Javier Pastore for a record French transfer fee. The club targeted superstar David Beckham and Argentina forward Carlos Tevez in December and January but both players ended up staying at their respective teams, Los Angeles Galaxy and Manchester City. Milan striker Alexandre Pato was another to turn down PSG\u2019s advances, but he and fellow Brazil star Kaka of Real Madrid may yet move to Paris when the transfer window reopens in July. \u201cIn the summer I think the market will be more open,\u201d Ancelotti said. \u201cWe will have more possibilities as compared to January but I think all the players can come. \u201cThe club tried to reach an agreement with Beckham but I was not here. I was not involved in this thing and I think they were very close; Beckham (said he might) come here but at the end decided to stay in Los Angeles to play with Galaxy.  Cash for cups? Qatar\u2019s influence \u201cTevez was a different thing because Tevez\u2019s first choice was Milan, but he had a problem with Milan. The second choice was PSG but we didn\u2019t find an agreement economical with him and we were not able to buy for this reason.\u201d Ancelotti\u2019s appointment at PSG has also seen him reunited with Leonardo, who he managed in two separate spells at Milan. Leonardo also spent time working above Ancelotti at the San Siro after being appointed Milan\u2019s technical director in 2008. \u201cI have a good experience because he was my player in Milan and he was my boss in Milan at the same time. So I have a very good relationship,\u201d the former Italy international said.  \u201cBut I think that one of the reasons I am here is because Leonardo knows me very well and knows what kind of a job I can do, so I think when we met for the first time I think we were agreed on everything.\u201d"

        "content": "Three-time defending champion Novak Djokovic overcame a stubborn challenge from Ukranian Sergiy Stakhovsky to reach the quarterfinals in Dubai Wednesday. The World No.1 trailed 1-3 in the second set before winning the next five games to close out a 7-5 6-3 victory in 90 minutes. It earned him a last eight clash with fellow Serbian Janko Tipsarevic, who beat Italy\u2019s Flavrio Cipolla 6-7 6-1 6-1 at the ATP 500 tournament. The last time the pair met was in the round-robin stages of the ATP World Tour Finals in London last November where Tipsarevic scored a shock victory over his compatriot. \u201cI need to try to be aggressive. I need to try to stay close to the line. That\u2019s all. He doesn\u2019t have many weaknesses in his game,\u201d Djokovic told the official ATP website. Second seed Roger Federer is also through to the quarterfinals after a later 7-5 6-3 win over Spain\u2019s Feliciano Lopez. The Swiss maestro needed just one hour 15 minutes to wrap up victory as he bids for back to back tournament wins after claiming the Rotterdam title. Federer, who is bidding for a fifth Dubai crown, has a repeat of his 2007 final win as he next faces Mikhail Youzhny.  The Russian went through with a 6-2 7-6 win over against American sixth seed Mardy Fish. Britain\u2019s Andy Murray, playing his first tournament since losing to Djokovic in an epic semifinal at the Australian Open, also went through with a routine 6-3 6-4 win over Swiss qualifier Marco Chiudinelli. The third seed needed three sets to beat Michael Berrer in his opening match but broke service once in each set against Chiudinelli to progress. Standing in his way in the quarterfinals will be giant Czech Tomas Berdych, who dispatched Slovak qualifier Lukas Lacko 6-1 6-2 in just 70 minutes. Murray said he was relishing the match-up with fifth seed Berdych. \u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed playing guys that are big hitters. That\u2019s his game. I\u2019ll have to try and find a way of neutralizing that by getting the first hit in the rallies, using a lot variety in my game. He can make mistakes, but you need to force him into doing that,\u201d he said.  "

        "content": "South Korea beat Kuwait 2-0 Wednesday to seal their place in the final stage of Asia World Cup qualifying as Group B winners. Their victory also meant Lebanon qualified in second place, despite a 4-2 defeat against the United Arab Emirates. Kuwait went into the match in Seoul needing a win to leapfrog Lebanon, while a draw would have been enough for 2002 World Cup semifinalists Korea. Kuwait gave the home side some scares in the first half and goalkeeper Jung Sung-Ryong had to be at his best. But after the break it was the Koreans who dominated as Lee Dong-Gook broke the deadlock in the 65th  minute. Lee Keun-Ho rounded off the scoring five minutes later to seal the victory. Lebanon had shocked South Korea 2-1 back in November to boost their hopes of going through, but were unable to repeat their heroics against the UAE. Goalkeeping and defensive errors undermined their performance, but with Kuwait losing they go into the draw in Kuala Lumpur on March 9. Aleksandr Shadrin scored the only goal as Uzbekistan beat Japan 1-0 to top Group C. Shadrin netted in the 54th minute as Japan slumped to their second defeat in the section to leave them six points adrift of Uzbekistan in the final standings. \u201cWe should have scored in the first half when we had several chances. Uzbekistan took the offensive in the second half and we couldn\u2019t play our game,\u201d Japan coach Alberto Zaccheroni told AFP.  Another disappointed coach was Dutchman Frank Rijkaard after his Saudi Arabia side failed to progress. The Saudis led Australia 2-1 at the break but leaked three goals in five second half minutes to lost 4-2. Alex Brosque with a double, Harry Kewell and Brett Emerton scored for the Socceroos who top Group D. But Oman\u2019s Hussain Al Hadri and Abdul Aziz Mubarak scored to give them a 2-0 home win over Thailand and claim the second qualification spot in the group. It will be the second straight World Cup the Saudis have failed to qualify after making four in a row from 1994 to 2006 and leaves former Barcelona coach Rijkaard with an uncertain future. In Group E, Bahrain routed Indonesia 10-0, but their efforts were in vain as Mohammed Kasola\u2019s scored a late equalizer for Qatar in a 2-2 draw in Iran to go through at the Bahrainis expense.

        "content": "Two superb goals from Arjen Robben sunk England at Wembley as the Netherlands secured a last-gasp 3-2 win in Wednesday\u2019s busy schedule of international friendlies. It was cruel on England\u2019s stand-in manager Stuart Pearce, who had seen his experimental side battle back from 2-0 down only for the Bayern Munich star to grab the winner in extended injury time. An entertaining game burst into life just before the hour mark as Robben surged forward and drove home a low shot past England goalkeeper Joe Hart. Less than a minute later and the 2010 World Cup runners-up were two ahead as striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar bravely headed home Dirk Kuyt\u2019s perfect cross from the right. Huntelaar, who replaced Robin van Persie at halftime, clashed heads with England defender Chris Smalling in scoring and both played no further part in the match. England had their chances to get on the score sheet and Chelsea striker Daniel Sturridge, who had replaced Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard midway through the first half, spoiled an encouraging performance by a bad miss from close range. But soon afterwards central defender Gary Cahill beat the offside trap to slot past Maarten Stekelenburg. Then in the lengthy stoppage time, substitute Phil Jones slipped in forward Ashley Young to score an unlikely equalizer. But Robben was picked out by Mark van Bommel and with Leighton Baines standing off him, he had time to curl a shot home, albeit through a slight deflection off Cahill. England had named an inexperienced team with Tottenham\u2019s Scott Parker as captain ahead of Gerrard, while Pearce giave international starts to young striker Danny Welbeck, his Manchester United teammate Smalling, Chelsea\u2019s Cahill and Everton leftback Baines. Pearce said after the match that he believed a replacement for Fabio Capello would be in place by Euro 2012. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll go through the process of getting someone in place before the summer and if they don\u2019t, then they know they have got me available and all the planning is done,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, one of England\u2019s first group opponents in Euro 2012, France, scored an upset 2-1 win in Germany in a clash between two former world champions. It was the first defeat for Joachim Low\u2019s team in 11 games, but the home side were left depleted by injuries to regulars. A first-half goal by France\u2019s Olivier Giroud put the visitors on their way to a deserved victory.  Giroud, the leading scorer in Ligue 1 this season for his table-topping side Montpellier, then set up substitute  Chelsea\u2019s Florent Malouda for the second. Germany\u2019s Brazil-born striker Cacau scoring a late consolation for the hosts. \u201cFrom our point of view, everything went well, I was pleased with the way  we pushed forward and, of course, I\u2019m very pleased with the win,\u201d Blanc, who took over from Raymond Domenech after their sorry 2010 World Cup campaign, told AFP.  The United States enjoyed a notable 1-0 win over Italy with Fulham striker Clint Dempsey\u2019s second-half goal earning a fourth successive victory and another boost for new manager Jurgen Klinsmann. Dempsey came close to opening the scoring in the first half as he forced a fine save from Gianluigi Buffon, while Sebastian Giovinco tested U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard. Lionel Messi worked his magic again to help Argentina to a 3-1 win over Switzerland in Bern with a hat-trick. The Barcelona superstar scored twice in the final five minutes to secure victory after Xherdan Shaqiri had leveled his 19th-minute opener. World champions Spain thrashed Venezuela 5-0 in a late kickoff with Messi\u2019s Barca teammate Andres Iniesta putting the home side on their way with the opener.   Manchester City midfielder David Silva added the second before Valencia striker Roberto Soldado staked his claim for regular inclusion with a hat-trick to round off a convincing win."

        "content": "Until last year, James Murdoch was widely regarded as heir-apparent to his father Rupert\u2019s global News Corp. media empire \u2013 a remarkable turnaround for a college dropout once viewed as the family\u2019s black sheep. But that aspiration took a hit following revelations that \u2013 while he was boss of News Corp. Europe and Asia \u2013 the group\u2019s British Sunday tabloid the News of the World eavesdropped illegally on politicians, celebrities, army veterans and even a teenaged murder victim in search of stories.  The scandal has exposed collusion between journalists, media groups, politicians and police, claiming the jobs of top police officers, newspaper executives and Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s spokesman, while dozens of people have been arrested.  Despite his insistence, in his testimony to the Leveson inquiry investigating the matter, that he knew little of the scale of the hacking by News of the World employees, James Murdoch has also paid a price professionally. In February he resigned as executive chairman of the British newspaper division; in April he stepped down as chairman of News Corp.\u2019s UK-based broadcasting arm BSkyB, and subsequently relocated to the United States.  Murdoch, 39, said he was resigning to try to shield the satellite broadcaster from fallout from the newspaper scandal. \u201cI believe that my resignation will help to ensure that there is no false conflation with events at a separate organization,\u201d he said Yet despite his corporate leadership having been heavily criticized by UK media regulator Ofcom \u2013 which found his actions in relation to the hacking scandal \u201crepeatedly fell short of the conduct to be expected of him as a chief executive officer and chairman\u201d \u2013 Murdoch may have suffered only a momentary career setback. In September, UK media reported that he was set to take over the running of Fox Networks, prompting angry responses from News Corp shareholders. One shareholder quoted in a UK newspaper called the news a \u201cslap in the face for shareholders, not to mention victims of the hacking scandal.\u201d   As its deputy chief operating officer and head of international operations, Murdoch was the third most senior figure at News Corp., wielding considerable influence through the stable of newspaper titles at his command. Murdoch finally succumbed to the turmoil that for a time threatened to engulf the entire company, even after it stepped away from a controversial bid to acquire full control of its UK-based broadcasting arm, ending any possibility of him succeeding his father at the helm of one of the most powerful media empires in the world. James Murdoch\u2019s close links to the papers at the heart of the phone-hacking scandal were pivotal. It was he who announced the closure of the News of the World amid public fury about the paper\u2019s tactics. He always denied being aware of the phone-hacking activities \u2013 although he did authorize payments to appease victims. In evidence to a UK parliamentary hearing in July 2011, Murdoch said he could not recall seeing a key document known as the \u201cfor Neville\u201d e-mail. It implied that the practice was being conducted by more than one journalist, but this statement was directly contradicted by two of the company\u2019s senior employees and may be the focus of fresh questioning. Days after his appearance, Cameron said Murdoch had \u201cquestions to answer in parliament\u201d over his evidence. It was another intriguing chapter in a varied career to date. The third child from his father\u2019s second marriage, Murdoch once appeared to be the least likely of the media tycoon\u2019s offspring to succeed, despite his evident intelligence. Born in London, but raised in New York, he attended Harvard University, where he studied film and animation before dropping out in the mid-1990s to help launch a hip-hop music label, Rawkus Records. It wasn\u2019t long before Murdoch was brought into the family business. Rawkus was eventually bought by News Corp. and in 1996 Murdoch was persuaded to take over the company\u2019s nascent internet operations, with mixed results. By 2000 Murdoch was in charge of News Corp\u2019s Asian satellite business, Star TV, where he appeared to find his feet. In 2003 he took over its UK-based sister operation, Sky, quickly dispelling doubts about his business acumen by meeting ambitious profit targets. Murdoch continued to rise through the ranks, taking on his News Corp executive roles in 2007. At the time, Rupert Murdoch described his son as a \u201ctalented and proven executive with a rare blend of international perspective and deep hands-on experience.\u201d His new position handed him overall control of News International, an umbrella company that includes the Sun newspaper, the Times and the defunct News of the World \u2013 the paper whose activities triggered the current UK media crisis. Although regularly cited as one of the most influential figures in Britain, Murdoch\u2019s political allegiances have never been clear. A 2007 profile in the Observer newspaper said Murdoch was \u201cunimpressed\u201d by then opposition leader Cameron. The Telegraph, meanwhile, described him as a \u201cclose confidant\u201d of Cameron. Murdoch himself told the Financial Times in 2007: \u201cI don\u2019t comment on politics.\u201d Murdoch, who has two children with wife Kathryn Hufschmid, is said to be a black belt in karate. He is also proficient at corporate combat. In 2006 he steered BSkyB into the acquisition of a 17.9% stake in UK broadcaster ITN, blocking a rival move by Virgin Media. But it was his and News Corp.\u2019s plans to acquire full ownership of BSkyB that put them on a collision course with British lawmakers in the wake of the phone hacking scandal, with the company eventually deciding to back down under government pressure."

        "content": "No politician in Russia can draw a crowd like Vladimir Putin. Thousands of Muscovites filled a freezing Manezhnaya Square Sunday, cheering for the former president-turned-prime-minister as he celebrated election again to the nation\u2019s highest office and delivered a patriotic speech. \u201cWe are appealing to all people to unite for our people, for our motherland, and we will win,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a victory! Glory to Russia!\u201d The 59-year-old former KGB agent and law student has dominated Russian politics for more than a decade. He served two terms as president from 2000 to 2008, then most recently served as prime minister under current President Dmitry Medvedev. In September, Medvedev called on the ruling United Russia party to endorse Putin for president once again \u2013 and Putin, for his part, suggested Medvedev should take over the role of prime minister. In that vote, however, although United Russia held on to power it saw its number of parliamentary seats significantly decreased.  The balloting sparked ongoing protests and allegations of vote-rigging directed at Putin, and fueled speculation that his sway over Russian politics might be diminishing. Putin\u2019s critics focused on attempting to end his political career. But that seems unlikely following the election of March 4. With more than two-thirds of the vote counted, Putin was leading his closest rival by an almost 4-1 margin, dashing hopes of opponents that he could receives less than 50% and be forced into a runoff vote. Putin faced four other presidential contenders, including Russia\u2019s third-richest man, New Jersey Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov. Human rights groups say civil liberties and democratic freedoms have suffered during Putin\u2019s rule.  Former world chess champion Gary Kasparov is among Putin\u2019s critics. \u201cI think if anybody told us in August 1991 that nine years later, the country would be run by a KGB lieutenant colonel, this person would look like a laughingstock,\u201d Kasparov has said. Putin, the married father of two daughters, rose from humble beginnings to become one of Russia\u2019s most powerful men. He was born in St. Petersburg (then Leningrad), the son of a factory foreman, and raised in a communal apartment shared by three families.  He joined the KGB in 1975 and later was selected to attend the Red Banner Institute of Intelligence, where he learned both German and English. He was briefly assigned to counterintelligence duties in what was then East Germany before moving back to Leningrad, where he was assistant rector for international affairs at Leningrad State University. He left the KGB in 1992, and served several posts in St. Petersburg\u2019s government before accepting a job as deputy business manager for the State Property Administration in 1996, then head of the Presidential Administration and Control Department of the Presidency under Boris Yeltsin. When Yeltsin resigned in 1999, Putin \u2013 then acting prime minister \u2013 was appointed acting president. He was elected to the office the following year. He has received credit for consolidating post-Soviet Russia and bringing stability to the nation. He\u2019s also demonstrated a talent for self-promotion. Television viewers have seen him riding horseback without a shirt; on a motorcycle; diving; flying an aircraft; and demonstrating his judo skills (he holds a black belt). \u201cHe\u2019s an extremely charismatic person,\u201d said Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough guy, but he\u2019s a very balanced guy. He\u2019s a predictable guy, and he\u2019s a constructive guy.\u201d Russia\u2019s youth back Putin in droves, singing songs praising him and even getting tattoos of his face. The pro-Putin youth group Nashi, meaning \u201cours\u201d in Russian, was formed in 2005 by the United Russia party to promote patriotism and support for the Kremlin and for Putin.  But other youth are opposed to Putin and not buying into the cult of personality. During a nearly four-hour question-and-answer session Putin held last year on state television, the Russian word for \u201cBotox\u201d was trending on Twitter, and rumors persist that Putin appears younger, possibly with medical intervention. \u201cOne shouldn\u2019t react closely to rumors,\u201d Peskov said. \u201cThe less you react to rumors, the less they appear.\u201d Putin\u2019s campaign this time was deliberately low-key \u2013 he sent proxies to televised debates \u2013 but he still appears daily on state television.  A primary focus of his campaign had been modernizing Russia\u2019s military, saying it\u2019s the only way to improve Russian standing and clout in the world. He\u2019s proposed spending 23 trillion rubles (about $768 billion) on the military and the defense industry over the next 10 years. While he hasn\u2019t said where the money is coming from, Putin has maintained that Russia can\u2019t afford not to spend it. Still, Putin\u2019s critics show no sign of disappearing. Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Moscow, said last week that he believes the Kremlin has been \u201ctaken aback by the degree of opposition\u201d \u2013 so much so, he said, that it\u2019s conceivable that a reported assassination plot targeting Putin may have been a scheme to build support for him. \u201cThere was a similar alleged plot against him the election before last,\u201d said Wood, who is now a Russia expert at the London-based think tank Chatham House. \u201c\u2026It\u2019s conceivable, but it seems improbable.\u201d Wood said ahead of Sunday\u2019s vote that even if Putin won, \u201cit won\u2019t necessarily mean he has strong and durable support.\u201d "

Adams Golf Speedline Fast 12 Fairway Wood: Fairway woods have long lived in the shadow of gleaming new drivers, but this club is tipped to change things in 2012.  Top players Robert Karlsson and Ryan Moore already use this one, which Adams Golf calls the world\u2019s most aerodynamically efficient club thanks to its patented Velocity Slot Technology \u2013 which significantly reduces drag and promotes a trampoline-like effect that literally launches the ball toward the hole.   Costing $249.99 per club, it won\u2019t break the bank for the average player. 7. CHAMP Flix Divot Repair Tool: This colorful divot tool has a \u201cswitchblade\u201d design that releases the tool at the push of a button.  And, when you\u2019ve finished repairing your ball mark, the Flix\u2019s ergonomic form slips easily into your pocket while ensuring the lining of your clothes survives the round unscathed.  The Flix is available in pink, red, blue, orange, green or black and retails for $9.99 8. ECCO BIOM Hybrid shoe: ECCO has gone to town on this fancy piece of footwear, which is being marketed as golf\u2019s first performance hybrid shoe.  The company says it scanned the feet of more than 2,500 athletes, resulting in an exceptionally lightweight shoe that provides stability, ground feel and swing power.  Designed to be worn both on and off the course, the shoe isn\u2019t cheap at $190 per pair \u2013 but it is made from Tibetan Yak leather! 9. CHAMP Zarma FLYtee: They say you drive for show and putt for dough, but if you can\u2019t get your first shot on the fairway then it\u2019s hard to keep the big scores off your card.

In his keynote address at the Mobile World Congress, Schmidt said for the \u201caspiring majority\u201d of five out of seven billion global citizens, \u201cthe web is still a scarce resource.\u201d \u201cThe first future belongs to the early adopters, the lucky few. For this group the future offers only the limits of science and ethics,\u201d he said. \u201cFor most people the digital revolution has not arrived yet. Every revolution begins with a small group of people. Imagine how much better it would be with another five billion people online,\u201d he said. Schmidt predicted that in the next decade there would be many improvements to connectivity; but there is a limit to the amount of new infrastructure that would be laid by 2020, he said. \u201cSmartphones are part of the solution, but having a smartphone is not enough to get you online.\u201d He suggested that isolated communities could share data in peer-to-peer or \u201cmesh networks,\u201d describing them as a \u201cdigital watering hole.\u201d Anyone with solar equipment can set up a network, he said. \u201cEven modest amounts of connectivity changes lives.\u201d  In this new world it will be easier for people to mobilize against dictators, as the uprisings in the Arab World had shown, he said. Some governments would try to control access to the web and new technology, but he said he believed they were going to fail. \u201cCitizens will demand a more ethical deal. There will still be elites, but technology is a leveler, and those with nothing will have something.\u201d \u201cEveryone is blessed with creativity and imagination and the capacity for innovation. In every person there\u2019s an even better company waiting to get out. Let us commit ourselves to building a world where everyone has a chance to be connected,\u201d he said. In his 2010 keynote at the MWC, Schmidt proclaimed Google\u2019s new strategy of \u201cputting mobile first.\u201d The following year he gave an update on the rise of Android and emphasized the importance of cloud computing to the future of new mobile services."

The arrests include four people in Spain, 10 in Argentina, six in Chile and five in Colombia as part of a worldwide sweep carried out as part of Interpol operation \u201cExposure.\u201d Interpol did not immediately announce charges against the 25.  After Interpol announced the attacks, its website failed to load, a fact acknowledged by Anonymous on Twitter with the message \u201cinterpol.int DOWN.\u201d  Who or what is Anonymous? The Spanish police website also failed to load after it announced police had arrested four people in the country as part of the international action. Spanish police said the four suspects were accused of carrying out denial of service attacks, defacing the websites of political parties, institutions and companies, as well as publishing personal information relating to high-profile figures. One of those arrested was a 16-year-old girl, who was allegedly part of international \u201csector 404,\u201d a hacking group which is believed to be linked to the attacks claimed by Anonymous. Police said the girl had been released to the custody of her parents.  Two of the others had been detained, while the third was released on bail, police said. Anonymous made headlines in 2010 when it carried out distributed denial of service or DDOS attacks targeting MasterCard, Visa and PayPal websites.  DDOS is a kind of network stress test in which each attacker gives consent to have his or her computer linked to a bot net. The force of all those computers working together, focused on one site, overwhelms the targeted site\u2019s server and consequently disrupts or takes the site down. At the time, Anonymous claimed that it was lashing out at the corporations because they had stopped doing business with WikiLeaks, the publisher huge tranches of confidential information under the leadership of founder and editor Julian Assange. Since then, the group has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks, notably claiming that it attacked government websites in Tunisia and Egypt as a way to show support for protesters during Arab Spring uprisings.  A video \u2013 laced with Anonymous\u2019 typical computer-voiceover \u2013 appeared online during the January 2011 revolution. It threatened Egyptian authorities if they attempted to censor Internet access and other freedoms. \u201cAnonymous is you. You will not be denied your right to free speech, free press, free association and your universal right to freely access information both in real life and on the Internet,\u201d the voice said. Anonymous had a hand in organizing and agitating in the Occupy movement throughout 2011. Protesters have been seen at Occupy demonstrations across the globe wearing Anonymous\u2019 distinctive Guy Fawkes mask. This year, the group claimed to have posted an internal FBI conference call discussing investigations into Anonymous. It also posted e-mails that it claimed were from an adviser to the Syrian president, suggesting how Bashar al-Assad could downplay violence in the country when he was interviewed by Barbara Walters last summer.

        "content": "Football clubs and national federations have long been at loggerheads over the balance between domestic and international matches, but Europe\u2019s top teams heralded a \u201cmajor breakthrough\u201d on Tuesday. Europe\u2019s top soccer clubs and the continent\u2019s governing body, UEFA, have announced an agreement which would reduce the amount of international fixtures. The European Club Association (ECA) confirmed UEFA had pledged to amend its football calendar to include nine two-match international breaks over a two-year period rather than the current 12. The agreement would also spell the end of single-match international breaks, such as this week\u2019s set of fixtures which features high-profile friendly matches like England\u2019s clash with the Netherlands and Germany\u2019s home match against France. \u201cThe agreement with UEFA is a major breakthrough for European club football,\u201d Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, ECA Chairman and CEO of German giants Bayern Munich, said in a statement. \u201cUEFA clearly recognizes the importance of clubs and the significant contribution they make to the success of national team football. The negotiations have not always proved easy, but were always conducted in a fair and respectful manner.  \u201cThis is once more proof that in the European football family solutions can be found in a cooperative and fair way.\u201d Despite UEFA and the ECA finding common ground, the agreement must still be ratified by football\u2019s global governing body, FIFA. Rummenigge, a two-time European Footballer of the Year, said talks with FIFA president Sepp Blatter have so far proved unsuccessful. \u201cWhile an agreement has been reached with UEFA, the situation remains unsatisfactory in relation to FIFA,\u201d he said.  \u201cUnfortunately, discussions with the FIFA president have failed to lead to a satisfactory outcome which takes account of the clubs\u2019 demands.\u201d The German\u2019s comments prompted a response from FIFA, who claimed the issue of the international calendar was up for debate at a meeting on March 5. Football\u2019s global governing body also said Rummenigge and other ECA representatives had declined invitations to be part of the discussions. \u201cFIFA is surprised by recent comments made by ECA stating that they are not satisfied with their discussions,\u201d read a statement on FIFA\u2019s website. \u201cECA representatives have previously declined attendance to other FIFA committee meetings, making it very difficult for progress to be made in discussions with the European clubs. \u201cFIFA remains, as always, willing to discuss with ECA on these topics, as it does with all other stakeholders in the world football community.  \u201cFinally, FIFA would like to recall that the international dates and the international match calendar have to be applied on a worldwide basis and that this calendar is ultimately regulated by FIFA, as football\u2019s world governing body.\u201d The agreement would also see UEFA take out insurance aimed at covering players who are injured while on international duty.  The insurance would be in place from the forthcoming Euro 2012 tournament in Poland and Ukraine onwards. If the new rules are put into place, there would be a limit on only one international tournament each year. It also states that the African Cup of Nations must start as early in January as possible in years when it is being held, while other international tournaments must be finished by mid-July. "

        "content": "On December 10 last year a huge crowd rallied in Moscow. The people were fired up about alleged election fraud and fed up with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. It was unprecedented in the country\u2019s post-Soviet history. Unthinkable in Putin\u2019s Russia. It inspired predictions of a Russian Winter to rival the Arab Spring. Now three months, and several huge opposition rallies later, Putin looks certain to be elected president again. So what happened? The big protests were ultimately triggered by claims that widespread cheating boosted the results for Putin\u2019s United Russia party in December\u2019s parliamentary election \u2013 claims the Kremlin denied.  But there were other factors. Putin\u2019s announcement three months earlier that he would bump Dmitry Medvedev and seek the presidency again for himself was a key moment. It wasn\u2019t a total surprise.  Many had long suspected that Medvedev was just a seat warmer, helping the real boss work around the constitution and its limit of two consecutive presidential terms. But there was also hope Medvedev, who is considered a reformer, would find the fire in his belly to openly fight for the top job. It was a naive hope. The brazen admission of their private deal was like an open hand slap to the face \u2013 a stinging reminder of who really has the power. Suddenly Russians were confronted with the possibility of 12 more years of Vladimir Putin\u2019s rule. Many of the people most appalled by that idea have done well under Putin. They\u2019re educated, well traveled and economically comfortable. For Russia\u2019s new middle class the authoritarian stability of the Putin years has brought prosperity. But it\u2019s no longer enough. Now they want their vote to count and they want to use it to get rid of Putin. \u201cThe most educated, the most responsible part of Russian society has come together to deliver a single message,\u201d one first-time protester told me. \u201cThe current government has no right to represent Russian society. They don\u2019t say what we want to say. They don\u2019t take actions we want to take.\u201d So says the urban middle class. But they don\u2019t speak for the country.  \u201cIt\u2019s pure mathematics,\u201d says Putin\u2019s spokesperson Dimitri Peskov. \u201cYes we have something like 70,000 people out there [protesting] on Sakharov Avenue but at the same time we have to keep in mind they are a minority. The majority of the population does not live here in Moscow. We have a huge country and if we look eastwards we\u2019ll see lots and lots of big cities, small towns and rural populations that still support Putin pretty well.\u201d There\u2019s another important reason why Putin appears set to win. There\u2019s no obvious alternative. Putin\u2019s closest electoral competitor is the Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov \u2013 a serial election loser. This would be his fourth defeat. Two other candidates, right-wing table thumper Vladimir Zhirinovsky and left-leaning Sergey Mironov have also run and lost spectacularly in the past. Billionaire businessman Mikhail Prokhorov is the only fresh face in the pack. On paper, his manifesto of democratic and economic reforms should appeal to many of Moscow\u2019s protesters. But he\u2019s struggling to shake off his reputation for being too close to the regime. Cynics call him a Kremlin project, a candidate designed to credibly attract the middle class vote without posing a genuine threat. Prokhorov\u2019s repeated denials and slick campaign have not seen his polling move beyond single figure territory. The line-up of wannabe presidents is said to be another example of what\u2019s known here as \u201cmanaged democracy\u201d where opposition candidates and parties are tolerated but only if they know their place. Critics describe it as the illusion of democracy. While Vladimir Putin\u2019s victory seems assured, we don\u2019t know what it will look like. Will there be more allegations of fraud? Will he win comfortably? Or will he get less than 50% of the vote and be forced into a runoff with the second place candidate? The last scenario appears increasingly unlikely but it\u2019s what leaders of the opposition movement are desperately hoping for. It would be a clear sign Putin\u2019s support is eroding as well as an opportunity to weaken him further. But however he wins, the next Russian president can expect continued public dissent. \u201cWe want to see new elections,\u201d says leading opposition figure Alexei Navalny. \u201cVladimir Putin won\u2019t win on March 4. He will appoint himself as tsar. He\u2019ll try to remain Russian president for the rest of his life. We need to fight and stop him from wrongly taking power. Our goal is to keep pressure on Putin.\u201d In light of that intent, the answer to one question will sharply define Russia\u2019s immediate future: How would President Putin respond to further challenges to his authority?  Vladimir Putin remains a sure bet for the presidential election. Beyond that there\u2019s only one other certainty. He\u2019ll be leader of a country that has changed dramatically in the last three months. "

        "content": "Tiger Woods has done it all in the world of golf. He has won 14 majors, topped the world rankings for a record 623 weeks in a row and enjoyed a lifestyle which the majority of people can only dream of. But it seems that the world\u2019s top-earning sportsman once thought about giving it all up \u2013 to join the Navy. According to a book written by the 36-year-old\u2019s former coach Hank Haney, Woods seriously considered quitting golf to become a Navy SEAL. SEALs are the special operations arm of the U.S. Navy, so called because of their ability to operate in the sea, in the air or on land. According to Haney, Woods became infatuated with the idea of joining the specialized force. \u201cTiger was seriously considering becoming a Navy SEAL,\u201d read an excerpt from Haney\u2019s forthcoming book on the website of Golf Digest. One of the magazine\u2019s journalists helped write the book. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d go about it, but when he talked about it, it was clear he had a plan,\u201d Haney said. \u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, here is Tiger Woods, greatest athlete on the planet, maybe the greatest athlete ever, right in the middle of his prime, basically ready to leave it all behind for a military life.\u2019 \u201c The book is based on the six years Haney spent as Woods\u2019 swing coach, which ended in May 2010 after the former world No. 1 dropped out of the first round of the The Players Championship with a neck injury. Haney also revealed that in 2004 Woods went on a four-day special operations training course at Fort Bragg. \u201cTiger did two tandem parachute jumps, engaged in hand-to-hand combat exercises, went on four-mile runs wearing combat boots, and did drills in a wind tunnel. Tiger loved it, but his physical therapist, Keith Kleven, went a little crazy worrying about the further damage Tiger might be doing to his left knee,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOne morning I was in the kitchen when he came back from a long run around Isleworth, and I noticed he was wearing Army boots. Tiger admitted that he\u2019d worn the heavy shoes before on the same route. \u2018I beat my best time,\u2019 he said.\u201d Woods\u2019 agent Mark Steinberg rejected Haney\u2019s claims as \u201carmchair psychology.\u201d He suggested Haney was twisting Woods\u2019 admiration for his late father, who was in the U.S. Army special forces. \u201cBecause of his father, it\u2019s no secret that Tiger has always had high respect for the military,\u201d Steinberg said in a statement to the Orlando Sentinel. Haney also suggested Woods put pressure on himself to overhaul fellow American Jack Nicklaus\u2019 record total of 18 wins in golf\u2019s four major tournaments. \u201cHe never mentioned Nicklaus\u2019 record, but it started to weigh more heavily at every major,\u201d read another excerpt from \u201cThe Big Miss.\u201d  \u201cAnd Tiger\u2019s actions indicated he believed he had less time to do it than everyone thought.\u201d Woods has not won a major since the 2008 U.S. Open, and is rebuilding his career following the scandal about his extramarital affairs which led to his divorce in 2010."

The 16-time grand slam winner took just 18 minutes to wrap up the first set 6-0 against his French opponent but struggled in the second before eventually taking it on a tie-break. The Swiss, who recently won the World Tennis Tournament in the Dutch city of Rotterdam to take his career titles count to 71, is gunning for a fifth crown in Dubai. \u201cIt\u2019s always great to start off a tournament winning the first set 6-0,\u201d second seed Federer told the ATP Tour\u2019s official website. A family affair in Dubai but mixed results for the Djokovic brothers  \u201cAfter that, I really had to sort of make sure I controlled Michael as much as I could because I know he\u2019s a dangerous player.  \u201cI think I was solid.

        "content": "A new French law making it a crime to publicly deny the Ottoman Empire\u2019s genocide of Armenians a century ago was ruled unconstitutional Tuesday by France\u2019s Constitutional Council. The measure, which triggered condemnation from modern Turkey, was given final passage by the French Senate and signed into law by President Nicolas Sarkozy last month. Sarkozy\u2019s office immediately issued a statement calling for a new version of the law \u201ctaking into account the decision of the Constitutional Council.\u201d \u201cThe president believes that genocide denial is intolerable and must be punished in this regard,\u201d the statement said. The country\u2019s highest judicial body reviewed it at the request of National Assembly members and French senators. \u201cThe Council deems the law unconstitutional,\u201d a short statement from the court said Tuesday. The Turkish government called it \u201can example of irresponsibility\u201d and vowed to \u201cexpress our reaction against it in every platform\u201d when the bill passed the National Assembly \u2013 the lower house of the French parliament \u2013 in December. The Turkish Foreign Ministry issued a statement Tuesday that called it \u201cpleasing that a grave mistake has been corrected by the highest legal authority in France.\u201d \u201cWe hope France will from now on be in a constructive attitude for the dispute between Turkey and Armenia on history to be considered on a fair and scientific basis, and will make contributions that support a solution rather than further deepening the problem,\u201d the Turkish ministry said.  \u201cSuch an attitude will contribute to the Turkish-French relations to improve in all areas as well.\u201d Armenia\u2019s government hailed the passage last month, saying France \u201creaffirmed its pivotal role as a genuine defender of universal human values.\u201d  It is already illegal in France to deny the Holocaust of World War II, a crime punishable by a year in prison and a fine of 45,000 euros (about $60,000). The same punishment would apply under the Armenian legislation. The Turkish-Armenian controversy over the killings that took place last century has reverberated wherever diaspora communities representing both groups exist. Armenian groups and many scholars argue that Turks committed genocide starting in 1915, when more than a million ethnic Armenians were massacred in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire. Turkey officially denies that a genocide took place, saying hundreds of thousands of Armenian Christians and Turkish Muslims died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of World War I. Sen. Herve Marseille, one of the bill\u2019s supporters, argued that since France already recognizes the Ottoman-era killings as genocide, the same standard that applies to Holocaust denial should apply to the Armenian case. \u201cWhen we contest the Jewish genocide, we can be punished,\u201d Marseille said. \u201cAnd up until now, when we contest the Armenian genocide, there is no punishment. So we can\u2019t have a legal punishment for one and not for the other. Everyone is equal in front of the law.\u201d But Sen. Jacques Mezard, who opposed the legislation, said freedom of expression was at stake. \u201cIt calls into question historical and scientific research. Tomorrow will there be a question of a Vendee genocide?\u201d he asked, referring to a revolt against the French revolutionary government in 1793. \u201cWill we put the Spanish and the United States in the stocks for the massacre of Native Americans? We must reject this text and consign it to history books.\u201d After December\u2019s vote in the National Assembly, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused France of committing its own \u201cgenocide\u201d during its war against Algerian independence in the 1950s and 1960s. Erdogan announced that Turkey was reviewing its ties with France. Ankara recalled its ambassador to Paris for consultations, canceled bilateral visits and wouldn\u2019t cooperate with France in joint projects within the European Union. The French Foreign Ministry shot back at Erdogan\u2019s comments, saying France \u201cassumes with clarity and transparency its duty to remember the tragedies that have marked its history.\u201d And Sarkozy has said that his country doesn\u2019t need an OK from another nation to develop its policies. In addition to being NATO allies, Turkey and France have trade ties valued at $13.5 billion, according to Turkish statistics. The genocide debate is also a source of tension between Turkey and the United States, another NATO ally. The White House, for example, annually beats back efforts in Congress to pass a resolution that would formally recognize the 1915 massacre of Armenians as genocide."

Passengers and crew will be put on planes and sent home almost immediately, the Indian Ocean nation\u2019s tourism chief said. Costa Cruises said it had secured 600 plane tickets and 400 hotel rooms.  There are more than 1,000 people on the Allegra. With power out, they are using mineral water for washing, Costa said. They have a supply of cold food including fruit, cheese and cold cuts, and fresh bread is being flown to the ship by helicopter, the company said. A large French fishing ship began towing the liner to port on Tuesday. A Seychelles Coast Guard ship reached the Costa Allegra later in the day, along with two tugboats from the Seychelles Ports Authority, said Seychelles presidential spokeswoman Srdjana Janosevic. The ship was being escorted to Port Victoria, the Seychelles capital, she said. The Allegra lost power in the Indian Ocean Monday with 636 passengers on board and a crew of 413, according to Costa Cruises.

Arsenal back coach Wenger as club post profits of $78m \u201cThis is our strategy to bring PSG on long term to be one of the biggest in the world,\u201d he told World Sport anchor Pedro Pinto. \u201cWe are not saying we are going to be the best club in the world, because it\u2019s really tough; you\u2019ve got history behind other clubs in the (English) Premier League or Spanish or Italian leagues so we are going to try and make it. \u201cFor us, of course, with the passion of football you know we love football, we love Paris. Paris is a great city and it\u2019s really that Paris deserved to have a big club in the world and that\u2019s why we came to Paris and bought PSG. \u201cIn the beginning some of the people for sure, they were against us but now I believe most of them or all of them they are with us, supporting us and PSG. Honestly I am so proud today of where we are.\u201d Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani bought a 70% share of PSG through his Qatar Sports Investments company in June 2011 and installed 38-year-old Al-Khelaifi as president. The ex-tennis professional recruited Leonardo as general manager and the Brazilian World Cup winner wasted little time in utilizing the new wealth at his disposal to splash a reputed $57 million on Argentina midfielder Javier Pastore. Ronaldo backheel keeps Real 10 points clear in Spain Another signal of the club\u2019s intent to make waves in Europe came with their failed pursuits of Manchester City\u2019s Argentina striker Carlos Tevez and former Manchester United and Real Madrid star David Beckham.  But despite the vast sums of money being spent, Al-Khelaifi insists it is a long-term target of PSG to make the club profitable, and recruit players from the pool of young talent available in the French capital. \u201cThat is our strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cIn five years we want to make money \u2013 also you know we love football, we came to Paris as I said to be one of the biggest clubs in Europe. \u201cYou know, our advantage for sure it\u2019s Paris, it\u2019s the capital, twelve million people live in and around Paris, you have got a lot of talented kids around Paris.  \u201cYou know the best French players come from Paris. If you see Thierry Henry, (Lilian) Thuram, Nicolas Anelka you know it\u2019s really worth it to look for them and look for the new (Lionel) Messi. Why not from Paris?\u201d But for now, the immediate target is to end the club\u2019s 18-year wait for the French league title, and the lucrative rewards it would deliver in terms of a Champions League place. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be great in this stadium to see us playing against Barcelona or Real Madrid,\u201d  Al-Khelaifi said. \u201cThis is one of our dreams.\u201d"

        "content": "Ian Paisley, the firebrand Northern Ireland unionist politician, has been released from the hospital after three weeks, his wife said Tuesday. Paisley was a key figure in ending three decades of conflict in Northern Ireland, making peace in the end after leading Protestants against compromise with Roman Catholics for years. Eileen Paisley said she and her family were \u201cdelighted that my husband has been able to return home.\u00a0 It is not possible to put into words the depth of our gratitude to those responsible who cared for him these past three weeks, nor can we express sufficiently our thanks to all those who have sent their good wishes and prayers.\u201d Paisley was reported to have been hospitalized for a heart condition but the family did not confirm the reason. Paisley, 85, stepped down in 2008 as a leader of the power-sharing government formed the year before with Sinn Fein, the main pro-Irish party. He also resigned as head of the Democratic Unionist Party at the same time. Paisley had health problems in the past and received a pacemaker after becoming ill in the House of Lords of the United Kingdom parliament, which he joined as Lord Bannside in 2010. He made his name as a hard-line pro-British politician during the Northern Ireland conflict and was leader of the Democratic Unionist Party for almost 40 years. During decades of seemingly irreversible conflict between Northern Ireland\u2019s Protestant and Roman Catholic communities, Paisley was considered an uncompromising figure. The unrest in the province killed at least 3,600 people and injured 36,000 over the years. To the surprise of many, Paisley agreed to share power with his former sworn enemy, Sinn Fein. Paisley was elected Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister in 2007, with former IRA commander Martin McGuinness as deputy first minister. The pair became known as \u201cthe Chuckle Brothers\u201d after developing a close working and personal relationship. When Paisley stepped down, he was succeeded in both his first minister and Democratic Unionist Party leadership roles by his deputy, Peter Robinson."

        "content": "London\u2019s Metropolitan Police lent a retired horse to Rebekah Brooks when she was an executive at Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News International, her spokesman and the police said Tuesday. The revelation was met with incredulity and scorn amid investigations into the potentially corrupt relationship between the police and the press in Britain. The news immediately prompted the creation of a Twitter account, RebekahsHorse, that began churning out puns including: \u201cMy PR has set me up a brief twitter question and answer session later this afternoon. Hope I don\u2019t stirrup any trouble.\u201d The BBC unintentionally added to the gag by putting a reporter named Fiona Trott on the story, her colleague Chris Mason tweeted. But along with the guffaws, the news ramped up pressure even further on Murdoch\u2019s empire as it is battered by investigations into police bribery, phone hacking and e-mail hacking. The relationship between the press and politicians has also come under scrutiny, to the extent that Prime Minister David Cameron last year denied ever having seen Brooks, a neighbor of his, in her pajamas. Cameron meant the remark as a joke in the rough-and-tumble atmosphere of the House of Commons, but it resonated as questions swirled about the reach and influence of Murdoch and his executives. Brooks, a former editor of the Murdoch tabloids the News of the World and the Sun, was arrested in July as part of the probe into police bribery and phone hacking. She resigned that month as chief executive of News International. She has not been charged. The police lent her the horse in 2008 and it was \u201cre-housed with a police officer in 2010,\u201d Scotland Yard said in a statement. The Scotland Yard investigation into illegal eavesdropping by people working for Murdoch was dormant at the time. It was reopened in early 2011. \u201cWhen a police horse reaches the end of its working life, Mounted Branch officers find it a suitable retirement home,\u201d the police statement said. Brooks is married to a horse trainer.  Her spokesman, David Wilson, refused to tell CNN the name of the horse."

The Russian-owned team \u2013 formerly known as Virgin \u2013 has now withdrawn from the last official test event in Barcelona this week to focus on passing the final requirement ahead of the season-opening race in Australia on March 18. \u201cWe are disappointed to confirm that the planned first test of the 2012 race car has been delayed as a consequence of not passing the final FIA crash test,\u201d the Britain-based team said in a statement on Tuesday.

First, rain led race officials to pull the plug Sunday \u2013 the first time in Daytona 500\u2019s history.  Then, continuing showers led them to re-reschedule the start from noon to Monday evening.  When the race finally got underway, a massive fire with 40 laps to go red-flagged it for a couple more hours, pushing the race into a third day. In the end, Matt Kenseth crossed the finish line about 1 a.m. Tuesday, claiming the 54th running of \u201cThe Great American Race.\u201d  The Daytona 500 victory was the second for the driver, who edged out Dale Earnhardt Jr. and teammate Greg Biffle to take the checkered flag. Those who made it to the end survived multiple accidents, including one on the second lap, and 10 caution flags. Officials shut down the race for nearly two hours after Juan Pablo Montoya careened into the back of a jet dryer that was being used to blow debris off the track during a caution flag.  Montoya\u2019s car, the jet dryer and the truck pulling it all burst into flames and also set a section of the track on fire. Montoya said he had returned to the race track from pit row before the accident, after having the crew check out a vibration he was feeling in his car. \u201cI was in fourth gear.  I wasn\u2019t even going that fast,\u201d Montoya told reporters.  \u201cIt just felt really strange and \u2026 the car just turned right.\u201d Some 24 hours of intermittent rain forced Monday\u2019s prime-time start \u2013 the first since the inaugural race in 1959. Before this year, rain had cut short four of 53 previous races \u2013 in 1965, 1966, 2003 and 2009 \u2013 but none had been canceled for the day. The Daytona 500 opens the NASCAR season, but it also is the sport\u2019s most prestigious race. Daytona International Speedway announced this month that the race will boast a record purse of more than $19 million.  In comparison, last year\u2019s Indianapolis 500 had a payout of $13.5 million."

        "content": "When FIFA named Qatar as the host nation for the 2022 World Cup finals, it vindicated the gulf nation\u2019s continued determination to become one of the key players in the realm of sport by using its considerable economic resources. The decision by world football\u2019s governing body was not met with widespread approval. Traditionalists argued that the kingdom, with a population of just 1.85 million of which only 300,000 are Qatari citizens, had never qualified for a World Cup finals and had no discernible history in the sport. Yet the power and influence generated by the oil-rich nation swung the vote Qatar\u2019s way and, in 10 years\u2019 time, football\u2019s showpiece tournament will be played in an Arab country for the first time since its inception in 1930. The Qatari influence in sport is growing year by year and, by the time 2022 is upon us, the portfolio of sporting franchises and sporting events owned by the nation will undoubtedly be even more impressive than it is today. In football, Qataris own Spanish club Malaga and French giants Paris Saint-Germain. They also host major events in tennis, golf and cycling and are one of the five bidders to host the 2020 Olympic Games, as well as establishing the Aspire sports academy, one of the most prestigious facilities of its kind in the world. But why are Qataris so heavily involved in the sporting world? And what do they hope to achieve? \u201cWhen Qatar discovered their huge gas reserves they invested millions in sport, raising their worldwide profile by buying athletes and footballers and giving them Qatari citizenship,\u201d Middle East football expert James Montague, author of the book \u201cWhen Friday Comes \u2013 Football In the Warzone,\u201d told CNN. \u201cSeveral Uruguayan players were paid lots of money to switch countries, but this proved a disaster with the national team still failing to qualify for the 2006 World Cup finals,. \u201cThat didn\u2019t work, so the next way to qualify was to actually host the tournament and raise their profile by buying football clubs. Now they are spending billions on its infrastructure to ensure Qatar is synonymous with sporting and football excellence.\u201d Sheikh Saoud Bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, secretary general of Qatar\u2019s Olympic Committee, offers an insight into why the nation, and its ruling royal family, is such a major force in the sporting world. \u201cSport has huge power and, for a nation like Qatar that has such widespread diversities, in many ways it can put us on the world map,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Future Cities show. \u201cWhen you organize a big event it brings people from all over the world into your country, and with that comes an exchanging of cultures and a lot of media coverage. \u201cSports tourism is also a massive business at the moment. In Qatar we are organizing more than 30 events a year and the economy being generated on the back of these events is massive.\u201d Another Qatari-owned organization is TV channel Al Jazeera. Since its launch in 1996 as an Arabic news and current affairs satellite station, the channel has expanded rapidly over the years and has now become a serious bidder in the TV sports rights market. This was illustrated at the end of last year when it outbid French pay-TV operator Canal Plus to screen UEFA Champions League matches exclusively in France for the next three years. Having also won the rights to show French domestic league football from next season, allied to the ownership of Ligue 1 title challengers PSG, it is clear that Qatar now has a huge presence in that country. Football journalist Julien Laurens says Qatar\u2019s influence in French football, and PSG in particular, is not necessarily a good thing. \u201cThe Qatari influence in French football is massive at the moment, although it does seem to create a conflict of interest as they own the biggest club as well as also owning the TV rights to the league that club plays in,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThere is no doubt that a revolution is currently taking place within the French game, but the Qataris have been lured to PSG by the glamor and prestige of the capital city and there is a danger that the league could become all about that one team for many  years to come.\u201d Laurens added: \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect PSG to dominate things so quickly but they are already splashing the cash, which is creating a huge gap between them and the rest of the clubs. \u201cIt was easy for them to take over a French club and lead them to the top straight away, it would not have been as easy in England, Spain or Italy.\u201d Although Qatari businessmen now have a strong foothold in French and Spanish football, they remain without a key base in the English Premier League, which boasts the highest attendance figures in European football. However, according to Montague, that situation might change in the near future, with a massive English institution firmly on Qatar\u2019s radar. And there is a near precedent following the 2008 takeover of Manchester City by an Abu Dhabi consortium. \u201cThe Qatari Investment  Authority have been sniffing around Manchester United for a long time,\u201d Montague said. \u201cI have had conversations in Qatar with prominent people and they have told me that United would fit their profile of wanting to use sport in general, and football in particular, to raise their profile to that of a world power. \u201cThe Glazer family, who currently own United, will sell because they will get a better price from the Qataris. It isn\u2019t just a numbers or profit thing with the QIA, they want the institution that United stand for.\u201d It remains to be seen whether United, or indeed any other many English club, comes under Qatari ownership in the near future but, with a World Cup and possible Olympic Games both on the horizon, the tiny gulf state is only going to grow in sporting stature and importance over the next decade."

Most of the passengers are from Europe, but eight are from the United States and 13 are from Canada. The cruise line said it had reached the emergency contacts of 402 passengers to inform them of the situation. All the passengers are in good health, the Italian coast guard said Monday. Costa said the passengers were served a cold breakfast Tuesday morning and have been invited to prepare their luggage for disembarkation. \u201cHelicopters will ensure (a) continuous supply of food, comfort items and flashlights in order to mitigate guests\u2019 discomfort given the difficult conditions on board,\u201d Costa said. The ship departed from Diego Suarez, Madagascar, on Saturday and was originally scheduled to arrive in the Seychelles Tuesday.

Just after midnight local time (GMT) officers accompanied by bailiffs converged on the camp, which was home to around 70 activists, Occupy London organizers told CNN. Witness Ronan McNern said police formed a number of cordons to stop protesters and their supporters from entering the camp while the tents were being dismantled. \u201cThe tents are being taken and put in garbage trucks and you can hear them being crushed which is horrible,\u201d he said.

Protesters have been camping on the steps of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral since October 15 last year as part of the worldwide Occupy movement. Activists have been rallying against corporate greed and economic inequality, calling for a fairer society for all. One of the organizers of Occupy London, Spyro Van Leemnen told CNN the protesters anticipated the raid after losing an appeal on February 22 against an eviction notice filed by the City of London Corporation, the body that runs London\u2019s financial district. \u201cWe had some information it would be tonight or tomorrow,\u201d he said, adding that the group used social media to urge supporters to join them when they realized the raid was imminent.

While there was disagreement as to whether they should leave the London site, he said, all agreed that the movement should continue.  \u201cThis is not the end of Occupy London and there have been discussions already about the future of the movement,\u201d Van Leemnen said, adding that plans were underway for worldwide Occupy protests in May. He said that Occupy members would not attempt to revive the camp at St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral. \u201cThat\u2019s the end of this particular camp in that form of protesting,\u201d he said. \u201cLegally we cannot set up any tents and there will obviously be a police presence.\u201d  In a statement on its website, the City of London Corporation confirmed that it had take action to remove the protesters. \u201cWe regret that it has come to this but the High Court Judgment speaks for itself and the Court of Appeal has confirmed that Judgment,\u201d the statement said.

I am not going to let anything distract me in Melbourne. That is the plan.\u201d Whether 2012 will be Webber\u2019s final year with the Austrian-owned Red Bull team remains to be seen, but he is determined to focus on achieving results on the track. \u201cWhen you are in front in Formula One you are always under intense scrutiny.

He is not at his level yet, but he\u2019s getting there.\u201d As for Marko, he said there were plenty of positives and negatives to being the brother of the world\u2019s No. 1 player. \u201cFinancially, you know, I have all I need and can get the coaches and the right practice environment. But everybody expects you to be like your brother,  which is really tough to achieve. \u201cSometimes I have an advantage because maybe opponents get scared. But others think, \u2018He\u2019s Novak\u2019s brother, so I must beat him.\u2019 And that can be tough.\u201d Novak had no such trouble in negotiating his opening round test, defeating German Cedrik-Marcel Stebe 6-4 6-2 in his first outing since securing his fifth grand slam crown in Melbourne. He has won four straight titles in Dubai and will face either Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky or Omar Awadhy, from the United Arab Emirates, in round two.  Elsewhere, world No. 8 Mardy Fish made light work of Andreas Beck, beating his German opponent 6-1 6-1. Fish will play Russia\u2019s Mikhail Youzhny or Frenchman Richard Gasquet next."

        "content": "\u201cThe Artist\u201d beat out films from the likes of Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg and George Clooney to top honors at the Academy Awards on Sunday \u2013 not bad for a silent, black-and-white French film with no big-name stars.  Director Michel Hazanavicius\u2019s love letter to old Hollywood cinema was the undisputed king of the industry\u2019s biggest night, garnering five Oscars for best picture, best directing, best costume design, best original music score and best actor. But was the rise of \u201cThe Artist\u201d from contender to best picture winner \u2013 the first silent film to win the award since \u201cWings\u201d at the first Academy Awards in 1929 \u2013 a triumph of marketing over art? For many, the film\u2019s triumph at the Oscars was a foregone conclusion, the result of a marketing process set in motion months ago by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who snapped up the U.S. distribution rights before anyone at the Cannes film festival had a chance to swoon over the French film last year. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any doubt when it came to the top awards who the winners were going to be,\u201d Total Film deputy editor Jamie Graham told CNN. \u201cHarvey is the best in the business at getting that awards attention, and it became clear with \u2018The Artist\u2019 two months ago that this was the film that had caught the tailwind.\u201d The mercurial movie promoter and co-founder of Miramax Films, credited for discovering \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d director Quentin Tarantino and a string of commercial and critical successes including \u201cThe English Patient,\u201d \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d and last year\u2019s \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech,\u201d is famous for harnessing the momentum of his films at the right time and riding waves of publicity to wins at the podium and at the box office. No sooner had Jean Dujardin taken the top actor award for his portrayal of silent film star George Valentin at Cannes than Weinstein had the film\u2019s stars and directors hitting the award campaign circuit to capitalize on its surprise success. Best actor winner Dujardin walked red carpets around the world as other awards began to flood in. Co-stars Berenice Bejo and John Goodman plugged the film on CNN, and Uggie, the film\u2019s canine star, played dead and performed tricks from the film on major news channels on both sides of the Atlantic. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t play the game tend not to win at the Oscars,\u201d said Graham. \u201cYou really have to press the flesh and hit the road, and for the last three months their lives would\u2019ve been dedicated to that.\u201d Empire magazine\u2019s Ian Nathan says that by the time the Golden Globe Award nominations came around, the race for Oscar glory had narrowed to a two-horse race between George Clooney\u2019s \u201cThe Descendants\u201d and \u201cThe Artist\u201d \u2013 a race Weinstein\u2019s relentless campaign strategy began to win by the end of last year. \u201cSomething about what Harvey managed to do \u2013 getting these three very charming leads and the director out there, getting the dog out there, screening it to everyone who mattered, milking the nostalgia and old Hollywoodness of it \u2013 lifted it from the competitor to the favorite long before the show came around,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cOnce one film has a foothold \u2013 once it\u2019s become the thing like \u2018The King\u2019s Speech\u2019 did last year \u2013 then even Clooney can\u2019t compete,\u201d he said.  Weinstein\u2019s strength, says Nathan, lies in his ability to catch a \u201cmiddle-brow\u201d film right before it becomes popular and turn it into the frontrunner. Nathan told CNN: \u201cHe\u2019s very good at picking the middle-brow films\u2026 and the Oscars are a mainstream event which celebrates the best of the middle. Harvey\u2019s been a very wily player in that, and you have to give him that credit, he knows how to map that out over a year.\u201d  While \u201cThe Artist\u201d has punched above its weight at the box office, tallying roughly $76 million in worldwide receipts so far (58% from outside the U.S.), the film didn\u2019t receive much of a box office bump following the announcement of Oscar nominations in January, according to Ian Nathan \u2013 especially compared with \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech,\u201d which raked in an estimated $415 million worldwide (66% from international)  on its way to winning best picture, actor and director at the 2011 Academy Awards. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t made the usual Oscar success money that the \u2018The King\u2019s Speech\u2019 did last year,\u201d said Nathan. \u201cIt\u2019s a silent film with a French sensibility, and it\u2019s a tougher sell for audiences. But now that it\u2019s got all the attention in the world, can that translate to more money?\u201d While the money may not follow, Nathan says one thing seems certain \u2013 after a relatively dry decade, the back-to-back successes of \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and \u201cThe Artist\u201d means Harvey Weinstein is back in business.  \u201cHarvey\u2019s come out of his fallow years as the guy to beat at the Oscars,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a second coming \u2013 clearly he\u2019s still got a little bit of that magic.\u201d"

        "content": "The chief executive of English Premier League club Arsenal has urged the team\u2019s supporters to get behind under-fire coach Arsene Wenger. Ivan Gazidis told the north London team\u2019s fans that Wenger was the best man for the job on the day that Arsenal announced pre-tax profits of $78 million for the six months until the end of November. The club\u2019s healthy financial situation off the field is diluted by a precarious one on it, because despite Sunday\u2019s 5-2 thrashing of local rivals Tottenham, the Gunners are in a battle to finish fourth and claim England\u2019s final, lucrative European Champions League spot. Wenger, from France, has delivered three Premier League titles and four FA Cups during his 15-year reign and has never failed to qualify for the continent\u2019s most prestigious club competition. Arsenal fight back to win sensational north London derby But the team have been below par this season, and are in fourth place only on goal difference, ahead of London rivals Chelsea, and 17 points off leaders Manchester City. \u201cWe hear the noise, we understand the concern of the fans, we know that there are issues, we know we\u2019re not where we want to be,\u201d Gazidis told Arsenal\u2019s official website on Monday. \u201cBut I can tell you that this team, our manager, the players, are absolutely united in what we have to do for the rest of the season, which is to finish in the top four. It\u2019s very much in our hands. \u201cVictory through harmony. The strength of this club has always been its unity and our fans and our players need to come together in this fight for the rest of the season.\u201d The early-season sales of Cesc Fabregas to Barcelona and Samir Nasri to Manchester City helped Arsenal post such healthy profits. During the same period in 2010 the club made a loss of $9.6 million. Gazidis confirmed there was money available to spend on players but said that UEFA\u2019s new Financial Fair Play regulations, which aim to make football clubs more sustainable and live within their means, would help moderate a voracious market. Should Manchester City accept Tevez\u2019s apology? \u201cWe have a healthy cash balance of \u00a3115 million ($181 million) for the half year. But it\u2019s important to understand that not all that money\u2019s available to invest in transfers. We have running costs of the club, player salaries and so on, so that amount goes down during the year,\u201d Gazidis said. \u201cWe also have to keep something in reserve in case things don\u2019t go our way. There is money available, we don\u2019t talk about an exact figure \u2013 and there\u2019s a very good reason why we don\u2019t put an exact figure on that \u2013 because it would impact on our negotiating position. \u201cWe have to invest efficiently, we have to invest sensibly. That doesn\u2019t mean we get every decision right \u2013 we don\u2019t. But we do get the majority of them right and that\u2019s been one of the secrets of Arsenal\u2019s success over a long period of time.\u201d Meanwhile, the English FA has charged three players with making alleged homophobic statements on social networking site Twitter. Manchester United\u2019s Federico Macheda, who is on loan at Queens Park Rangers, Newcastle\u2019s Nile Ranger and Manny Smith of third division Walsall stand accused of bringing the game into disrepute. An FA statement read: \u201cThe charge is that the players acted in a way which was improper and/or brought the game into disrepute. It is further alleged that the breach included a reference to a person\u2019s or persons\u2019 sexual orientation.\u201d The trio have until Wednesday to respond to the charges."

        "content": "The publisher of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News of the World has paid singer Charlotte Church and her family \u00a3600,000 ($952,000) to settle a phone-hacking lawsuit, her lawyer said Monday.  The payment by Murdoch\u2019s News Group Newspapers includes \u00a3300,000 in damages, plus legal costs, lawyer Mike Brookes said \u2013 far more than other hacking victims have been paid. Speaking outside the court after the settlement was reached, Church said the behavior of tabloid journalists had \u201csickened and disgusted her,\u201d and she did not believe the News International apology in court was sincere. \u201cThey are not truly sorry; they are just sorry they got caught,\u201d Church said. Murdoch\u2019s News of the World was closed down last summer over revelations about phone hacking and police bribery by people working for the newspaper. Targets of phone hacking included not only celebrities like Church but also victims of crime and terrorism, wounded troops and their families, and politicians. Police are conducting three investigations into illegal activity by British journalists and private detectives working for them. Two parliamentary committees are also probing the scandal, and a separate independent inquiry has been established by Prime Minister David Cameron. Cameron himself was drawn into the scandal for having hired a former News of the World editor, Andy Coulson, to be his spokesman after Coulson left the paper over the hacking scandal. Coulson has since resigned as Cameron\u2019s spokesman.  He denies wrongdoing, but is among more than a dozen people arrested over phone hacking. No one has been charged. The Church settlement is much higher than in 59 other suits settled recently by News International, the British newspaper publishing arm of Murdoch\u2019s News Corp.  Actor Jude Law was paid \u00a3130,000 ($206,000), for example, while retired soccer star Paul Gascoigne was paid \u00a368,000 ($108,000). The newspaper publisher has also been paying the legal costs of the suits. Church had been the lone holdout refusing to settle, but said Monday she had changed her mind to protect her parents. News International was prepared to make the case \u201cinto an interrogation into my mother\u2019s medical history,\u201d Church said. \u201cI would have learning nothing more from an actual trial since it was clear no one from News International was prepared to take the stand,\u201d she said. Brookes, her lawyer, said the settlement was higher than for others because Church\u2019s parents had also been targeted, starting when she was a teenager. \u201cThe News of the World trespassed into the lives of an entire family. James and Maria are not remotely in the public eye. They are no more and no less than proud parents with an exceptionally talented daughter,\u201d he said. He said in court that News of the World \u201ctargeted Charlotte and her voice mail messages repeatedly,\u201d obtained her personal medical information starting when she was 16, violated the privacy of her parents\u2019 voice mail, and \u201ccoerced\u201d Church\u2019s mother into giving them an interview about Maria Church\u2019s attempted suicide. A lawyer for the publisher said in court he accepted \u201ceverything Mr. Brookes has said,\u201d apologized, and said \u201cthey should never have had to endure what they have suffered.\u201d Church\u2019s settlement does not end the lawsuits against News International. Cherie Blair, the wife of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, announced February 22 that she was suing over allegations her voice mail was intercepted to get news of her pregnancy when her husband was in office."

        "content": "Spain\u2019s best-known judge was acquitted Monday of improperly investigating human rights abuses under the former dictatorship of Francisco Franco. However, Judge Baltasar Garzon remains under suspension. He was removed from the bench by Spain\u2019s judicial authority last week following his conviction in a second case. The nation\u2019s Supreme Court said Garzon improperly ordered wiretaps while investigating a financial corruption case.  Monday\u2019s acquittal was on a 6-1 ruling, according to a court spokesman.  Earlier this month, the court dropped a third case against Garzon, saying the statute of limitations had expired on alleged abuse involving some courses he taught at New York University years ago. Human rights groups, which sent observers to both of Garzon\u2019s trials, considered the case involving the Franco investigation to be the more important one.  \u201cThe Supreme Court has spared itself further embarrassment by rejecting these ill-advised charges,\u201d Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch said in a statement Monday. \u201cInvestigating torture and \u2018disappearances\u2019 cannot be considered a crime.\u201d Garzon, 56, was suspended provisionally from the bench in 2010 while awaiting both trials. He has been working as a legal adviser outside of Spain on human rights cases and judicial issues. Human rights groups said both cases amounted to a vendetta against Garzon, who became known internationally for his investigation into human rights abuses under former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. State prosecutors did not press charges in the case involving the Franco regime, but he was named in a private prosecution, as is allowed under Spanish law. It was led by a small civil servants union called Manos Limpias, or Clean Hands, which alleged that Garzon ignored an amnesty law approved by the Spanish Parliament in 1977. In that case, Garzon testified that he searched but could not find any national census of how many people disappeared or their identities. He decided to investigate, he said, because he considered those to be \u201cpermanent crimes\u201d which still affect people\u2019s descendants, since the remains have never been found. He said he began to see evidence that there was a \u201csystematic plan\u201d against Franco\u2019s opponents, which he said included forced disappearances, illegal detentions and assassinations. Franco\u2019s military uprising in 1936 triggered the three-year Spanish Civil War. The war ended when Franco\u2019s forces defeated Republican and leftist fighters. Franco\u2019s dictatorship continued until his death in 1975. Mass graves from the regime are still being unearthed, Emilio Silva, from a group called the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory, has said.  Garzon professed his innocence in the January trial involving the wiretaps. He ordered wiretaps against suspects who were in jail and under investigation in the case, allowing authorities to listen in on their conversations with defense attorneys and others. The lawyers later filed a lawsuit, arguing the wiretapping violated their constitutional right of attorney-client privilege. Garzon said the wiretap orders were backed by state prosecutors, who did not bring charges against him. He testified that he ordered the wiretaps on suspicion that the suspects in the case were involved in money laundering while they were in preventative prison.  But, the Supreme Court judges wrote, \u201cThe central question to be resolved in this case is related to the fundamental right of defense for the suspect, against the legitimate interest of the State to pursue crimes. It is not possible to have a just process if the right of defense is essentially eliminated.\u201d The court suspended Garzon from the bench for 11 years following his conviction. Garzon said that he \u201crejects\u201d the sentence and that the court convicted him in \u201can unjust and predetermined manner.\u201d He vowed to appeal."

Rain led race officials to pull the plug Sunday and try again Monday afternoon, but continuing showers led them to re-reschedule the start for Monday evening. The rain let up in the afternoon, and the race got under way about 7:15 p.m.  Ticket prices were not being refunded to Sunday ticketholders, a woman who answered the phone at the raceway said. The speedway can accommodate about 160,000 people, and the grandstands and infield were packed despite the 24-hour delay. Before this year, rain had cut short four of 53 previous races \u2013 in 1965, 1966, 2003 and 2009 \u2013 but none had been canceled for the day.  \u201cThis is one of the toughest things for us drivers,\u201d Carl Edwards said.  \u201cWhen you put that off for another day for all of us, it\u2019s now (about) who can really stay focused.\u201d Fellow driver Bobby Labonte shrugged off the delay.  \u201c(There\u2019s) not a whole lot we can do about the weather, but you just try to plan as much as possible,\u201d the winner of 21 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races said.  \u201cWhen you get in the race car, then everything else goes away and you\u2019re just ready to go.\u201d  The Daytona 500 opens the NASCAR season, but it also is the sport\u2019s most prestigious race.

        "content": "Manager Kenny Dalglish is determined to use Liverpool\u2019s first trophy win in six years as a catalyst for future success, following Sunday\u2019s dramatic penalty shootout win in the English League Cup final. The Scot, who is known as \u201cKing Kenny\u201d by the club\u2019s fans after a title-laden career as both player and manager, has had a difficult time since returning to Anfield for a second stint as boss in January 2011. Mixed results on the pitch and controversy off it \u2013 with the long-running Luis Suarez race row saga casting a shadow over the club\u2019s reputation \u2013 have meant big challenges for the man guiding one of England\u2019s most successful teams. Liverpool failed to qualify for any European competition this season, and could have faced a similar prospect in 2012-13 if Sunday\u2019s match against second division Cardiff City had ended in defeat. However, the club\u2019s fans were celebrating after the 18-time English champions clinched their first silverware since winning the FA Cup in 2006. It was also the first success for Liverpool\u2019s American owners, the Fenway Sports Group, who took over in October 2010. The Wembley match finished 2-2 after extra-time, but a penalty miss from Cardiff\u2019s Anthony Gerrard \u2013 cousin of Liverpool captain Steven \u2013 gave the five-time European champions an eighth success in the competition. \u201cOur people are absolutely delighted with their first trophy in six years, so it\u2019s been a very good day for us,\u201d the Scot told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ll just continue to work hard and see where it takes us. Arsenal fight back to seal emphatic derby win \u201cAlthough we\u2019ve won something today, that\u2019s not us finished. We don\u2019t want to stop here \u2013 we want to keep going. The best chance we have of doing that is to continue to do what we do best, and that\u2019s to stick together.\u201d Dalglish was previously Liverpool manager between 1985 and 1991, guiding the club to three league titles and two English FA Cup wins. The 60-year-old now wants to prevent another long wait for silverware. \u201cThe idea six years ago was not to go six years without winning a trophy! We\u2019ve won it, we\u2019re going to really enjoy it and we know how much they (the fans) have really enjoyed it. It gives you a flavor to come back and do it again,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only reason we\u2019re here is because every member of the squad has contributed to winning this trophy. If we all stick together and everybody makes a contribution, we give ourselves a better chance of success. \u201cWe got here because we worked really hard to get here and because the players are good players.\u201d Liverpool are battling to qualify for next season\u2019s European Champions League, a competition they have won most recently under Spanish manager Rafael Benitez in 2005. The seventh-placed Reds are seven points off England\u2019s fourth and final qualification place, held by Arsenal, but can reduce that deficit by beating the London side on Saturday following the midweek friendly internationals. Liverpool could yet claim a second trophy this season, with the club facing an FA Cup quarterfinal tie against Stoke City on March 18. Victory would earn a return to Wembley, with both semis to be played at the national stadium. \u201cWe\u2019ll go back to work after the internationals and see if we can kick on from here,\u201d Dalglish said.  \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody who has won a trophy has ever come away from it and said, \u2018I never enjoyed that.\u2019 If you get something you enjoy, you\u2019re going to want more of it.\u201d"

        "content": "The consequences of a military strike against Iran would be disastrous, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin wrote in a wide-ranging editorial Monday. \u201cRussia is worried about the growing threat of a military strike against Iran,\u201d Putin said in an editorial carried by the RIA Novosti news agency.  \u201cIf this happens, the consequences will be disastrous. It is impossible to imagine the true scope of this turn of events.\u201d The former Russian president, who is running for the post again, said he\u2019s convinced the issue must be settled by peaceful means. \u201cWe propose recognizing Iran\u2019s right to develop a civilian nuclear program, including the right to enrich uranium,\u201d Putin said.  \u201cBut this must be done in exchange for putting all Iranian nuclear activity under reliable and comprehensive IAEA safeguards.\u201d If that is done, Putin said, sanctions against Tehran must be lifted. Iran is under intense international pressure to demonstrate that it has no intention of pursuing nuclear weapons, with widespread Western sanctions targeting its financial and oil sectors. Crude oil sales make up about half of Tehran\u2019s revenue. Both Russia and China have been reluctant to back tougher U.N. Security Council sanctions against Iran. On another international hot spot, Putin said a \u201cLibyan scenario\u201d should not be employed in Syria. \u201cThe key objective is to prevent an all-out civil war.\u201d he said.  \u201cRussian diplomacy has worked and will continue to work toward this end.\u201d Russia abstained from a Security Council vote last year that cleared the way for airstrikes against forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi. \u201cSadder but wiser, we oppose the adoption of UN Security Council resolutions that may be interpreted as a signal to armed interference in Syria\u2019s domestic development,\u201d Putin said.  \u201cGuided by this consistent approach in early February, Russia and China prevented the adoption of an ambiguous resolution that would have encouraged one side of this domestic conflict to resort to violence.\u201d Putin\u2019s editorial comes a week ahead of this Sunday\u2019s presidential election. Putin handed over the presidency to ally Dmitry Medvedev in 2008, when he was barred from seeking a third consecutive term. After spending four years as prime minister, he announced in December that he would seek the presidency again. Putin has dominated Russian politics since 1999, and human rights groups say civil liberties and democratic freedoms have suffered during his rule. But opponents took to the streets by the thousands after his United Russia party won a narrow majority in December parliamentary elections that monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said were \u201cslanted in favor of the ruling party.\u201d The leading opposition candidate in the March 3 vote is Russia\u2019s third-richest man, billionaire New Jersey Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov. Critics of Putin showed up in the thousands on Sunday in a show of strength ahead of the election.  They attempted to complete a circuit of Moscow\u2019s 15-kilometer (9.3-mile) \u201cGarden Ring\u201d road, but fell short. RIA Novosti quoted police as saying 11,000 people turned out Sunday, far below the estimated 34,000 needed to complete the human chain. "

        "content": "A plot to assassinate Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has been foiled, Russia\u2019s state-run Channel One TV reported Monday, less than a week before presidential elections that Putin is expected to win. Citing unnamed sources, the report said a group of plotters was arrested in the Ukrainian city of Odessa in early January and, after weeks of questioning, confessed to planning to kill the Russian leader. The TV report included what it said was a confession by Adam Osmayev, a fixer associated with the two men who were seized in Odessa. \u201cOur final goal was to come to Moscow and try to organize an attempt on Prime Minister Putin,\u201d  Osmayev said. He said the plan involved using military-grade land mines to blow up vehicles. Channel One showed video of what it said was the raid on Osmayev\u2019s apartment by armed security officers wearing black bulletproof vests and helmets. The video shows Osmayev, with red marks on his back and bloody bruises on his face, kneeling as officers demand his name. Ukraine\u2019s domestic security agency, the SBU, uncovered the plot after an explosion at an apartment building in Odessa killed one of the plotters and injured another, Channel One said. The survivor tipped them off to Osmayev\u2019s involvement, the report said. The plotter who was killed was allegedly willing to be a suicide bomber, and the mission was organized by Chechen militant leader Doku Umarov, Channel One reported. CNN has not independently confirmed the existence of the plot, and a former British ambassador to Moscow expressed doubts about it. \u201cThere was a similar alleged plot against him the election before last,\u201d Andrew Wood said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much (all) you need to know. It\u2019s suspiciously convenient.\u201d Putin has dominated Russian politics for more than a decade, and his opponents accuse him of rigging parliamentary elections late last year.  International observers also said that the election was not free and fair, and protests of a size not seen in Russia in two decades followed the vote. Wood said the protests may have encouraged the Kremlin to say there was a plot against Putin\u2019s life to build support for him. \u201cThey\u2019ve been taken aback by the degree of opposition,\u201d said Wood, who is now a Russia expert at Chatham House, a  think tank in London. \u201cEven if he wins this election, which one must assume that he will, it won\u2019t necessarily mean that he has strong and durable support,\u201d he said. Wood did not say outright that he did not believe there was really a plot to kill the prime minister. \u201cIt\u2019s conceivable, but it seems improbable. Anything could be true. I can\u2019t say it\u2019s not true,\u201d he said. Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Russian news agency Itar-Tass that he confirmed the TV report but would not comment on it.  The Russian FSB declined to answer CNN questions about the alleged plot. The announcement comes a week ahead of this Sunday\u2019s presidential election. Putin handed over the presidency to ally Dmitry Medvedev in 2008, when he was barred from seeking a third consecutive term. After spending four years as prime minister, he announced in December that he would seek the presidency again. Human rights groups say civil liberties and democratic freedoms have suffered during his rule.  But opponents took to the streets by the thousands after his United Russia party won a narrow majority in December parliamentary elections, which monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said were \u201cslanted in favor of the ruling party.\u201d The leading opposition candidate in the March 3 vote is Communist Gennady Zyuganov. Russia\u2019s third-richest man, billionaire New Jersey Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov, and ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky are also running. Critics of Putin\u2019s showed up in the thousands on Sunday in a show of strength ahead of the election. They attempted to complete a circuit of Moscow\u2019s 15-kilometer (9.3-mile) \u201cGarden Ring\u201d road but fell short. The RIA Novosti news agency quoted police as saying 11,000 people turned out Sunday, far below the estimated 34,000 needed to complete the human chain. "

The state news outlet RIA Novosti quoted police as saying 11,000 people turned out Sunday, far below the estimated 34,000 needed to complete the human chain.

        "content": "Hunter Mahan thwarted Rory McIlroy\u2019s bid to become world No. 1 by beating the Northern Irishman 2&1 in Sunday\u2019s final of the WGC Match Play Championship in Arizona. Second-ranked McIlroy needed to claim the title to dislodge England\u2019s Luke Donald from top spot, but could find no answer to his 29-year-old U.S. opponent, who won his second World Golf Championship event. \u201cNo question when you play a WGC event, it\u2019s the best players in the world. It\u2019s not just in the U.S. it\u2019s in the world, so this feels pretty special,\u201d said Mahan, who climbed to ninth in the rankings, making the top 10 for the first time in his career.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get lucky in this week, because you\u2019re going to play such great players every single round.\u201d All square through the first five holes, Mahan dramatically turned the match his way by winning the next four holes through a mixture of brilliance and mistakes by U.S Open champion McIlroy. The 22-year-old McIlroy chipped in for an eagle to win the par-five 11th and pulled a further hole back with a birdie at the 14th, but could make no further impression. Mahan, who made six birdies in the final, is the first American to win the Match Play crown at Dove Mountain since Tiger Woods in 2008.  It was his fourth career victory on the PGA Tour, and capped a busy schedule of five successive tournaments \u2013 this one requiring him to play six matches over five days, including 36 holes on the last. McIlroy has another chance to claim the No. 1 ranking at this week\u2019s Honda Classic in Florida, where Donald will not be playing. \u201cI didn\u2019t have my best game with me this week, but I\u2019m happy with how I\u2019m playing and hopefully it won\u2019t be long before I\u2019m winning again,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got two more tournaments before the Masters and that\u2019s what I\u2019m building up to.\u201d Earlier on Sunday, McIlroy beat Ryder Cup teammate and world No. 3 Lee Westwood 3&1 in their semifinal to end the Englishman\u2019s hopes of reclaiming top spot.  McIlroy found himself three down after four holes to his former management agency stablemate Westwood, but he staged a sterling recovery to win four of the next five. Leading by one hole at the turn, McIlroy was never headed again and carded seven birdies in a fine victory. Mahan started fast against his semifinal opponent Mark Wilson, winning the opening two holes.   But the all-American clash remained close throughout and Mahan had to wait until the 17th to close out a 2&1 victory. Wilson beat Westwood 1-up in the third-place playoff."

        "content": "Cristiano Ronaldo scored the only goal of the match with a stunning backheel as Real Madrid beat Rayo Vallecano to stay 10 points clear in the Spanish title race Sunday. Real had to work hard to emerge on top in the capital derby at the Vallecas while arch-rivals Barcelona won 2-1 against Atletico Madrid in the late kickoff to avoid falling further behind Jose Mourinho\u2019s men. The reigning champions owed their win to a Lionel Messi free-kick in the 80th minute. It was his 28th league goal of the season, one fewer than Ronaldo. Dani Alves opened the scoring on 36 minutes but Radamel Falcao equalized at the beginning of the second half for the home side. Earlier, the first half of the clash between the Madrid rivals was short of chances, but Rayo came closest to scoring as Michu rattled the woodwork with Iker Casillas beaten. Ronaldo struck shortly after the break following a corner. He was running away to chase a loose ball, but then fashioned an incredible backheeled effort which flew into the net. \u201cA backheel is always different. It was a great goal but I\u2019m not sure if it  was the best of my career \u2013 I have to see it again on TV,\u201d Ronaldo told AFP. Jose Callejon later wasted a chance to double the lead for Los Blancos to calm their nerves. Ronaldo was also denied a second by home keeper Joel late on before the home side lost Michu to a red card for a rash challenge. It was Real\u2019s 21st league win of the season.    "

        "content": "Argentine Juan Martin del Potro claimed the 10th ATP Tour title of his career, but his first indoors, with a straight-sets win over local favorite Michael Llodra in the Open 13 event in Marseille. Del Potro \u2013 seeded four \u2013 only needed a break in each set to secure a 6-4 6-4 victory in just 83 minutes, ending a frustrating record on carpet which had seen him lose his previous three finals. \u201cMichael has a very difficult game to play against. He hits drop shots, he slices, so it\u2019s not easy to play against him,\u201d said the 23-year-old, who has now beaten 2010 Marseille champion Llodra in all their three meetings.  \u201cAll finals are special and you could see how nervous I was. When you win a title, it\u2019s special and you really have to celebrate it.\u201d The 31-year-old Llodra paid tribute to his younger opponent, adding: \u201cJuan Martin played a great match and didn\u2019t give me any opportunities on his serve.  \u201cI don\u2019t have any regrets. He was just better than me even though I kept fighting until the end of the match.\u201d  Meanwhile, Jurgen Melzer denied Milos Raonic a second successive title by winning the Memphis hard-court event on Sunday. Raonic successfully defended his maiden ATP Tour title in San Jose last weekend, but the Canadian had to settle for runner-up spot in Memphis for the second year in a row after losing 7-5 7-6 (7-4) to the Austrian. Former world No. 8 Melzer followed up his semifinal victory over American top seed John Isner and his earlier win over former finalist Radek Stepanek to claim his fourth ATP title. \u201cAfter a tough season last year, it\u2019s obviously something nice. He\u2019s probably the best server on tour at the moment. Sometimes you just walk left to right without doing anything, but I felt like when the ball was in play and when I had my chances, I played really solid,\u201d Melzer said. Raonic had dropped serve just once in 41 games before the final, where he fired another 22 aces for a tournament record of 88. \u201cHe neutralised my serve better than anybody else the last two weeks,\u201d said the 21-year-old, who lost to Andy Roddick in last year\u2019s final before going on to win the ATP Tour\u2019s newcomer of the year award. \u201cI just didn\u2019t catch on early enough. He was pretty much taking it to me. He was playing very close and inside the line, while I felt I was quite far behind, so I was the one doing most of the running.\u201d"

        "content": "French international Franck Ribery scored both goals for Bayern Munich in their 2-0 win over Schalke, on Sunday, but the Bavarian giants remain four points behind Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund, who defeated Hanover 3-1. Ribery, who was angry to be substituted in Bayern\u2019s Champions League defeat by Basel in midweek, opened the scoring with a superb 36th-minute individual goal, deftly flicking the ball away from keeper Timo Hildebrand before rolling the ball into an empty net. And he sealed the points for the home side 10 minutes after the break, slotting the ball home after a one-two with Bayern teammate Thomas Muller. But, despite the victory, champions Dortmund are still the side in pole position in the German title race after they saw off Hanover in front of a remarkable crowd of over 80,000 supporters. Poland striker Robert Lewandowski was their match-winner, with a double strike of his own to give Dortmund a seventh straight win and sixth in the Bundesliga. The 23-year-old opened the scoring in the 27th minute and doubled his tally early in the second half from close range after being set up by compatriot Jakub Blaszczykowski. A superb long-range strike from Ivory Coast striker Didier Ya Konan, who spotted Dortmund keeper  Roman Weidenfeller well off his line, gave the visitors some hope. But subsitute Ivan Perisic secured the points for Dortmund with a decisive third goal in injury time. Meanwhile, in Italy\u2019s Serie A, in-form Napoli beat Inter Milan 1-0 to pile the pressure on Nerazzurri coach Claudio Ranieri after a seventh defeat in eight matches. Ezequiel Lavezzi\u2019s second-half strike settled the match at the San Paolo to lift Napoli to 40 points and fifth place while Inter remain in seventh on 36 points. Napoli, who beat Chelsea in midweek in the Champions League, could even play the last 12 minutes with 10 men after Salvatore Aronica\u2019s sending off. Ranieri told Italian television after the defeat that his future was in doubt.  \u201cI don\u2019t know what the president (Massimo Moratti) will do now. This is a  question for him.

        "content": "England winger Theo Walcott scored twice as Arsenal fight back from going two goals behind to sensationally thrash north London rivals Tottenham 5-2, a result that lifts Arsene Wenger\u2019s side back into fourth place in the Premier League table. Matches between the top sides in England this season have produced a host of remarkable results \u2013 and it proved no different at The Emirates on Sunday on a glorious sunny afternoon. Third-placed Tottenham began the day 10 points ahead of their neighbors and still with designs of catching Manchester City and Manchester United at the top of the table. And they achieved the perfect start when Louis Saha\u2019s shot deflected in off defender Thomas Vermaelen to give Spurs a fourth minute lead. The visitors then doubled their advantage when former Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor scored from the penalty spot after goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was adjudged to have brought down Gareth Bale. But Arsenal rallied and two goals in the last five minutes of the half brought them level. First defender Bacary Sagna nodded home Mikel Arteta\u2019s cross, then Premier League top scorer Robin van Persie curled home a superb effort \u2013 his 23rd league goal of the season. Arsenal maintained their momentum after the break and Tomas Rosicky put them ahead in the 51st minute when flicking the ball home from close range. By now Arsenal were rampant, and Walcott made it 4-2 after 65 minutes after Van Persie superbly laid the ball into his path. With Tottenham demoralized, Walcott then added a fifth just three minutes later, outpacing the visiting defense before firing home. To complete a miserable afternooon for Harry Redknapp\u2019s side, midfielder Scott Parker was shown a second yellow card for a late challenge on Vermaelen as Tottenham finished the match with 10 men. The result leaves Tottenham seven points ahead of Arsenal, who go back above Chelsea on goal difference, although Spurs are now eight points behind second placed Manchester United \u2013 who closed the gap on Manchester City to just two points after a late 2-1 victory at Norwich on Sunday. City continue to lead the table on 63 points, with United still breathing down their necks in second after veteran pair Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs proved the difference against a determined Norwich side. Scholes, who came out of retirement this season at the age of 37, opened the scoring in the seventh mimute with a close-range header at the back post. But Norwich looked to have rescued a point seven minutes from time when Grant Holt fired home after his turn out-witted Rio Ferdinand. But 38-year-old Giggs, playing in his 900th competitive match for United, celebrated that milestone with a stunning winner, volleying home Ashley Young\u2019s cross in the second minute of injury time. Meanwhile, at Wembley Stadium, Liverpool defeated Championship side Cardiff City 3-2 on penalties to win the English League Cup, manager Kenny Dalglish\u2019s first trophy since returning to the club. Joe Mason had given Welsh club Cardiff a shock half-time lead but Martin Skrtel thumped home from close range after the break. Substitute Dirk Kuyt looked to have given Liverpool victory in extra time, but a late Ben Turner goal sent the match into a dramatic penalty shoot-out. Steven Gerrard and Charlie Adam missed Liverpool\u2019s first two spot-kicks, but Cardiff conspired to miss three of their own \u2013 two of them hitting the post. In an ironic twist, the final penalty miss was by Cardiff defender Anthony Gerrard, the cousin of the Liverpool captain. "

        "content": "Rory McIlroy has never played in a World Match Play semifinal before, and he has never been ranked No. 1. Lee Westwood lost his top spot at the World Golf Championship event in Arizona a year ago, and he wants it back. Before this week the Englishman had never made it past the second round of the 64-man tournament in 11 attempts. Ideally they would be meeting in Sunday\u2019s 18-hole final in a showdown to see who will depose Luke Donald as golf\u2019s top dog, but instead they will have to clash in the semi. The winner of that morning match will play either Hunter Mahan or Mark Wilson, with the U.S. assured of a shot at the trophy for the first time since Tiger Woods took it home for the third occasion in 2008. \u201cI think it\u2019s the match that most people wanted and definitely the match that I wanted,\u201d world No. 2 McIlroy told reporters after beating South Korea\u2019s Bae Sang-moon 3&2 in his quarterfinal on Saturday.  \u201cI\u2019m excited about tomorrow, it should be a lot of fun and very exciting for everyone involved. \u201cAll I need to do is focus on the match tomorrow morning, and then I think the biggest task for both of us, me and Lee, is getting yourself so much up for the semifinal.   \u201cYou have to get yourself up for that again. So that will be the tough task because obviously both of us feel you\u2019ve got to get past each other \u2013 for Lee to get back to number one and me to get there for the first time.   \u201cYou have to put your all into that and then whoever wins tomorrow morning, you get yourself back up again to go back out tomorrow afternoon and win the whole thing.\u201d While McIlroy has already won the U.S. Open at the age of 22, the 38-year-old Westwood is still waiting for his first major victory \u2013 though he has topped the European Tour money list and ended Woods\u2019 record-breaking run at the top of the rankings in 2010. \u201cWe\u2019ve played a lot together. It will be a good match \u2013 I hope it will be a great match, that we both play well and make a lot of birdies,\u201d Westwood said of the clash with his European Ryder Cup teammate after his 4&2 victory over Scotland\u2019s Martin Laird. \u201cMy priorities were to win major championships and win World Golf Championships because I haven\u2019t ever won any. I\u2019ve been at No. 1 a couple of times. It would be a different way of thinking to me compared to Rory, who hasn\u2019t been No. 1. He may be thinking about it, but my main goal is to play well or play as well as I\u2019ve been playing tomorrow morning and try and win that match.\u201d Neither Mahan nor Wilson are ranked inside the top 20, but have both been in fine form at the Ritz-Carlton course this week. World No. 22 Mahan went through after thrashing U.S. Ryder Cup teammate Matt Kuchar 6&5 in the shortest quarterfinal since the tournament started in 1999. \u201cMatt couldn\u2019t find the putter today, which is rare for him, because he\u2019s a great putter,\u201d Mahan said of his 14th-ranked opponent.  \u201cI got lucky in that aspect. But I played solid, didn\u2019t make any bogeys and didn\u2019t give many holes \u2013 and kept the pressure on him. That was nice to do.\u201d Wilson, ranked 42nd and a three-time winner on the PGA Tour, cruised past Sweden\u2019s Peter Hanson 4&3, and has yet to play past the 16th hole this week. \u201cI don\u2019t think too many people picked me to win,\u201d said Wilson, who is looking to follow in the example of last year\u2019s winner Donald and his predecessor Ian Poulter \u2013 none of the trio are long hitters.

        "content": "Roberto Mancini and Andre Villas-Boas have had sharply contrasting fortunes this season, but both managers celebrated vital victories in the English Premier League on Saturday. Mancini\u2019s Manchester City moved five points clear at the top of the table with a 3-0 victory over struggling Blackburn, putting the pressure on second-placed champions Manchester United to match that result at Norwich on Sunday. Villas-Boas\u2019 short reign at Chelsea has come under increasing scrutiny after the worst run of results since billionaire Roman Abramovich bought the club in 2004, but a similar three-goal win at another relegation-threatened team, Bolton, moved his side back into the top four. City suffered a relative lull in form in January with key players injured, suspended and away on international duty, but this month has brought three league wins and a two-leg double over Europa League champions Porto of Portugal to reach the last 16 of the continent\u2019s second-tier competition. Mario Balotelli, back from a four-match domestic ban, opened the scoring at home to Blackburn after half an hour with a delightful near-post finish from fullback Aleksandar Kolarov\u2019s left-wing cross. The eccentric Italy striker celebrated his 10th league goal this season by displaying his latest undershirt \u2013 his previous one asked \u201cWhy always me?\u201d but this one spoke of his love for girlfriend Rafaella. Strike partner Sergio Aguero doubled the lead seven minutes after halftime with his 16th league score, pouncing after Blackburn keeper Paul Robinson failed to deal with a corner from David Silva, who was also involved in the first goal. With Edin Dzeko coming off the bench to head home his 13th in the EPL from Kolarov\u2019s 80th-minute cross, it means Carlos Tevez may have to wait to make a meaningful contribution to City\u2019s bid for a first league title since 1968. The former City captain ended his three-month exile last week and apologized for his absence without leave, but is lacking match fitness.  Chelsea\u2019s form this month has left Villas-Boas having to deal with a reported player revolt and constant questions about his future. However, the Blues bounced back from the Champions League defeat at Napoli on Tuesday to earn a first victory in six games in all competitions. Center-back David Luiz struggled again in his usual defensive duties in Italy, but showed his undoubted attacking flair as he opened the scoring against Bolton just after halftime with a curling effort. Striker Didier Drogba doubled the lead after the hour and midfielder Frank Lampard celebrated his return to the starting line-up with the third with 11 minutes left. Lampard, whose European omission along with other key players prompted Abramovich to interrogate Villas-Boas about his tactics, made the veteran England international the first player to reach double figures in the Premier League nine seasons in a row. It was also his 150th in the EPL. The win put Chelsea above Arsenal into the fourth Champions League qualification place, putting even more pressure on the struggling Gunners ahead of Sunday\u2019s north London derby at home to third-placed Tottenham. \u201cThe most important thing about this weekend is going to be Arsenal-Tottenham tomorrow and to see in which way you benefit from it,\u201d Villas-Boas said. \u201cYou can either benefit from it with Tottenham coming closer to us or we finish in fifth again and \u2018drama\u2019 all week!\u201d Newcastle could have moved above Arsenal but blew a two-goal lead against lowly Wolverhampton Wanderers, who earned a vital point in caretaker manager Terry Connor\u2019s first match in charge. Connor has replaced the sacked Mick McCarthy until the end of this season, becoming the only black manager in charge of an EPL side this season. New signing Papisse Cisse scored his second goal for Newcastle and Jonas Gutierrez made it 2-0 inside 20 minutes. But winger Matt Jarvis pulled one back five minutes after the break and striker Kevin Doyle\u2019s 66th-minute leveler moved Wolves a point above the relegation zone. Newcastle joined Arsenal on 43 points \u2013 20 behind Manchester City. West Brom moved up to 12th after thrashing ninth-placed Sunderland 4-0, while Wigan stayed bottom after a 0-0 draw at home to Aston Villa \u2013 whose striker Darren Bent will miss England\u2019s friendly against the Netherlands next week after injuring his ankle. Queens Park Rangers were above the bottom three on goal difference only following the 1-0 defeat by west London rivals Fulham, who moved up to 11th after January arrival Pavel Pogrebnyak scored his second goal for the club. QPR debutant Samba Diakite was then marched for his second yellow card, becoming the team\u2019s third first-half sending-off in four home matches."

        "content": "Rupert Murdoch launched a new British tabloid Sunday to replace his disgraced News of the World, seven months after the best-selling Sunday paper was shut down over a phone-hacking and bribery scandal. The \u201cnew\u201d newspaper isn\u2019t entirely new \u2013 it\u2019s a Sunday edition of Murdoch\u2019s Sun tabloid, which had been a six-day-a-week paper until now. Its leading editorial on launch day took a defensive tone in discussing the closure of the News of the World. \u201cThe Sun has been a tremendous force for good,\u201d its editors insisted. \u201cIt is worth reminding our readers, and detractors, of that as we publish our historic first Sunday edition.\u201d The parent company of both tabloids, News International, \u201cclosed our sister paper the News of the World over the phone hacking scandal. Since then some of our own journalists have been arrested, though not charged, over allegations of payments to public officials for stories,\u201d the editors said. \u201cWe believe those individuals are innocent until proven guilty,\u201d they said. The first edition of the Sunday tabloid sets a tone like that of its weekday sister, leading with the story of a television presenter\u2019s difficult childbirth and putting a scantily-clad picture of singer Kelly Rowland on page three \u2013 a slot occupied by topless models during the week. Nelson Mandela\u2019s hospitalization at the age of 93 makes page 8, under the headline \u201cNelson Tum Op\u201d and above a picture of actress Kate Winslet in a low-cut dress accepting an acting prize. Under Murdoch, News of the World specialized in undercover investigations and salacious stories that earned it the nickname \u201cNews of the Screws.\u201d But revelations last year that it had paid for the hacking of voice mail messages to murder and terrorism victims and fallen troops, as well as celebrities and politicians, forced the paper to close. Police are running three separate investigations \u2013 into phone hacking, e-mail hacking, and police bribery \u2013 and two parliamentary committees and an independent inquiry are also probing British press practices. Murdoch testified before one of the panels of lawmakers last year, calling it the \u201cmost humble day of his life.\u201d  A former spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron, ex-News of the World editor Andy Coulson, is among those arrested. No one has been charged. The Sunday Sun launched with a print run of 3 million, far more than any daily newspaper sells in Britain, but well below the 4.75 million sales for the last issue of News of the World, according to its publisher.  News of the World was 168 years old and among the best-selling newspapers in the world when it closed."

        "content": "It could prove to be a pivotal moment in the Italian Serie A title race \u2013 Juventus escaped with a 1-1 draw at AC Milan on Saturday after Sulley Muntari\u2019s first-half goal was controversially disallowed despite clearly crossing the line. With champions and league leaders Milan leading 1-0 at the time, Juve keeper Gianluigi Buffon desperately clawed back the Ghana midfielder\u2019s header from a corner \u2013 and the referee waved play on to the dismay of the home players and their fans. \u201cThat incident that certainly falsified the result. Either the line was drawn wrong and was a bit too big,\u201d Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri told reporters. \u201cThere is no need to see the replays. It was pretty obvious from all around  the stadium.\u201d The visitors also had a goal disallowed in the second half as Alessandro Matri was deemed to be offside in a very marginal decision, but the substitute leveled in the 83rd minute with his 10th goal this season to maintain Juve\u2019s unbeaten record after 24 matches. Antonio Conte\u2019s team were reduced to 10 men five minutes later when Arturo Vidal was sent off for a cynical foul on Mark van Bommel, but held on to stay one point behind Milan with a game in hand. The Rossoneri had taken the lead after 14 minutes when Antonio Nocerino fired in a deflected shot against his former club, whose defender Leonardo Bonucci gave the ball away to Robinho with a careless pass. January loan signing Muntari thought he had added to midfielder Nocerino\u2019s eighth league goal this season, but the linesman did not flag for the goal despite replays showing the ball went well over the Juve line before Buffon intervened. Third-placed Udinese and Lazio both trail Juve by eight points, but can cut the deficit on Sunday with victories against Bologna and Fiorentina respectively. In Saturday\u2019s other match, mid-table Genoa snatched a 2-2 draw against Parma thanks to two late goals from striker Rodrigo Palacio. The Argentine striker followed up his saved penalty to pull one back in the 78th minute, then took his tally to 14 for this season deep into time added on. Parma led in the sixth minute through defender Massimo Gobbi, then striker Sergio Floccari made it 2-0 eight minutes after the break against his former team.    In Spain, Levante moved up into the fourth and last Champions League qualification place after snatching a 2-1 win at European rivals Espanyol in Saturday\u2019s late match. Substitute Ruben Suarez smashed in a freekick off the defensive wall in the 89th minute to seal the points after it had looked like the Barcelona-based hosts had earned a draw thanks to a 75th-minute header from Nigeria striker Kala Uche, who came on as a substitute. It was Valencia-based Levante\u2019s first win in nine La Liga matches. Malaga had temporaily taken fourth after thrashing bottom club Real Zaragoza 5-1, but ended the day in fifth \u2013 one point above Espanyol. Racing Santander and Sporting Gijon remained in the bottom three after sharing the points in a 1-1 draw, while Real Betis and Getafe had the same result in a mid-table clash. Spain\u2019s top three teams \u2013 leaders Real Madrid, champions Barcelona and third-placed Valencia \u2013 will play on Sunday."

        "content": "With Germany\u2019s title race set to resume in earnest on Sunday, Bayer Leverkusen took center stage in Saturday\u2019s Bundesliga action by claiming fifth place with a 2-0 win at struggling Cologne. Midfielder Lars Bender scored both goals to give Leverkusen successive victories for the first time since August and a one-point advantage over Werder Bremen, who crashed 1-0 at Nuremberg in the late kickoff. But it still left Leverkusen seven points adrift of Schalke, who travel to third-placed Bayern Munich on Sunday. Champions Borussia Dortmund, meanwhile, can stretch their two-point lead with victory at home to Hanover following second-placed Borussia Monchengladbach\u2019s home draw with Hamburg on Friday. It could be a pivotal round of matches, with five points separating the top four teams. Nuremberg climbed eight points clear of the relegation zone as Alexander Esswein\u2019s 65th-minute goal gave the visitors a second win in the last 10 meetings with the 2004 league champions. Bremen hold a two-point advantage over Hanover in the race for the final Europa League qualification spot, with Stuttgart a further five points back despite the 4-1 win over bottom side Freiburg in which Martin Harnik scored twice. Hoffenheim stayed behind their south-west rivals on goal difference after winning 2-1 at Wolfsburg, who dropped behind Hamburg and Mainz \u2013 4-0 victors over second-bottom Kaiserslautern. Cologne are four points above the relegation playoffs after a sixth defeat in seven, while Augsberg moved out of the bottom three with a 3-0 win over fellow strugglers Hertha Berlin thanks to two second-half goals from striker Torsten Oehrl."

        "content": "Agnieszka Radwanska is already the most successful Polish female tennis player, but her achievements will reach a new level when the world rankings are released on Monday. The 22-year-old will climb to a career-high No. 5 after winning the Dubai Tennis Championships on Saturday, when she beat Germany\u2019s rising star Julia Gorges 7-5 6-4 in the final. Radwanska, the first Polish woman to pass $1 million in prize money, claimed the eighth title of her career and her first this year. She extended her record to 15-3 this season, with her only defeats coming against world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka in the last eight at the Australian Open and the semifinals in Sydney and Doha. Gorges, making her Dubai debut, had reached her fourth career final after knocking out Caroline Wozniacki \u2013 Melbourne champion Azarenka\u2019s predecessor at the top \u2013 in Friday\u2019s semis. Victory on Saturday would have seen the 23-year-old climb to a career-high 15th in the rankings, up from 19, but \u2013 just like in the fourth round of January\u2019s opening grand slam Down Under \u2013 she had no answer to Radwanska\u2019s game. Meanwhile, former U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro reached his second successive final after beating top seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the Marseille Open on Saturday. The fourth-seeded Argentine, who has climbed back up the rankings to 10th after long-term wrist problems, won 6-4 6-7 (9-11) 6-3 against the French world No. 6 \u2013 who won this tournament in 2009. Both players had reached the career milestone of 200 match wins on Friday. Del Potro, who lost to world No. 3 Roger Federer in the Rotterdam final last weekend, will face 2010 champion Michael Llodra in Sunday\u2019s final. The Frenchman went through after beating Serbian third seed Janko Tipsarevic 6-4 7-6 (12-10) in the second semi. Jurgen Melzer reached the final of the Memphis hard-court event on Saturday, beating Czech third seed Radek Stepanek  6-4 3-6 6-3.  The Austrian followed up Friday\u2019s win over American top seed John Isner, while Stepanek ended the hopes of  2010 winner Sam Querrey of the U.S. in their quarterfinal Melzer will face last year\u2019s runner-up Milos Raonic on Sunday after the in-form Canadian defeated Germany\u2019s Benjamin Becker in straight sets. The 21-year-old, seeking a third ATP title of the year, took just 75 minutes to ease through 6-4 6-4. Fourth seed Raonic fired an impressive 14 aces on his way to a ninth straight victory and remains on course to add to his tournament victories in Chennai and San Jose. "

        "content": "A judge has dismissed the corruption case against former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, saying that the statute of limitations has expired. Berlusconi was charged with bribing a British lawyer, David Mills, to secure favorable testimony in legal cases.  Although Saturday\u2019s decision will spare Berlusconi prison time, the ruling is not the same as an acquittal. A written report on the case will be published within 90 days.  The ruling is a victory for the former premier\u2019s lawyers, who had argued that the statute of limitations in the case has expired. Mills\u2019 conviction in the case was overturned in 2010. Berlusconi, 75, dominated Italian politics for a decade and a half before resigning amid a financial crisis in November. He has survived a series of political, corruption and sex scandals over the years, involving allegations of embezzlement, tax fraud and bribery. In addition to the Mills case, he also faces trial on charges that he hired an underage prostitute and later tried to pull strings to get her out of jail when she was arrested for theft. "

        "content": "A treasure worth an estimated half billion dollars in gold and silver coins, recovered from a Spanish warship that sunk two centuries ago, arrived in Madrid Saturday, just weeks after U.S. courts ruled that Spain had rights to the loot, not the Florida deep-sea salvage company which found it on the ocean floor. Two Spanish military cargo planes, which retrieved the nearly 594,000 coins in crates from a secretive warehouse in Florida, landed at the Torrejon military air base in Madrid just before 2 p.m. (8 a.m. ET). The two planes arrived at a U.S. military base in Florida earlier this week \u2013 on the heels of a team of Spanish government experts who did an inventory of the treasure \u2013 and departed on Friday for the overnight flight to Madrid. That was after the Florida company, Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc. had exhausted its legal appeals all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined without comment Odyssey\u2019s motion for a hearing earlier this month. \u201cSpain has now been victorious at every level in the United States courts, from Tampa to Atlanta to Washington,\u201d said Jim Goold, who defended Spain\u2019s claim to the treasure. \u201cI am pleased and proud for all of us.\u201d Odyssey Marine Exploration made an emergency appeal to the high court in an attempt to block a lower court\u2019s order that it turn over the treasure to Spain. The dispute goes back to 2007, when Odyssey announced it had found a 19th-century sunken ship off of Spain. The company claimed ownership of the coins and said it had flown them to a guarded location in the United States. Spain filed suit in a federal court in Tampa, Florida, also claiming the treasure. Spain says its navy warship Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes was carrying the coins. The 34-gun frigate left Peru in 1804 and crossed the Atlantic to within a day\u2019s sail from Spain when British ships attacked the Spanish fleet. In the ensuing Battle of Cape St. Mary, south of Portugal, the Mercedes was hit in its powder magazine and exploded, according to the Spanish government\u2019s filing to the Florida court. In 2009, the federal court in Tampa ruled in favor of Spain and the federal appeals court in Atlanta upheld the ruling last September. Last January 31, the appeals court denied an Odyssey motion, which Odyssey appealed to the Supreme Court. Spain\u2019s Culture Minister, Jose Ignacio Wert, told CNN in Madrid earlier this month that the case was never really about the money. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to use this money for purposes other than artistic exhibition, but this is something that enriches our material, artistic capital and it has to be appreciated as such,\u201d Wert said in an interview. He said the coins would be exhibited at Spanish museums, and perhaps elsewhere. Peru, too, has followed the fate of the coins, which came from Latin America when Peru was a Spanish colony. \u201cFormally, they haven\u2019t claimed anything, but we are completely open to consider the possibility of distributing some part of the treasure also among the Latin American museums,\u201d Wert said. The treasure includes fabled \u201cpieces of eight,\u201d some minted in 1803 in Lima, Peru, Spanish officials have said. The treasure, which already has crossed the Atlantic Ocean twice, by ship in 1804 and then by plane in 2007, has now arrived on the Spanish mainland for the first time. A Spanish Defense Ministry official at the Torrejon base said the treasure will be turned over to Spain\u2019s paramilitary Civil Guard for safekeeping. The Culture Ministry is expected to hold a news conference and possibly show off a portion of the coins in the coming days."

        "content": "The son-in-law of Spain\u2019s King Juan Carlos arrived in court to testify before a magistrate Saturday as a suspect in a fraud scandal that has created unprecedented problems for the popular royal family. Inaki Urdangarin, who was granted the title of Duke of Palma when he married the king\u2019s youngest daughter, Princess Cristina, in 1997, is under investigation for allegedly diverting public funds that were earmarked for his foundation for private use. Urdangarin walked into the courthouse in Palma de Mallorca past throngs of reporters and news cameras, even though the court authorized him late Friday to avoid that scene on an \u201cexceptional basis and strictly for security reasons\u201d and to drive right up to the building. All the other suspects in the case who previously testified had to walk in, past the media. Urdangarin, with a serious look on his face and flanked by his lawyer, stopped briefly to make a statement to a group of reporters who were allowed inside a court-designated security zone. \u201cI am here today to demonstrate my innocence,\u201d Urdangarin said. \u201cDuring these years I have carried out my responsibilities and have made decisions in a correct manner and with total transparency. My intention today is to clear up the truth about the facts.\u201d As Urdangarin walked in, jeers and chants from anti-monarchy demonstrations, on nearby streets outside of the security zone, could be heard.             No trial has been set in the case, which has riveted national attention. \u201cPeople can understand if politicians, businesses or unions do this, but when it happens in the royal family, that is a hard blow for all Spaniards,\u201d said Gerardo Correas, an expert on royal affairs who runs the International School of Protocol in Madrid. The investigation, officially secret, has been top news for months in Spain as details were reported. The court in Palma de Mallorca has publicly confirmed only the basic charge of misappropriation of public funds and named Urdangarin and some former associates as suspects. Urdangarin, an Olympic medalist in handball, led a private foundation that secured lucrative contracts from regional governments to promote sports and tourism. As the case gained notoriety, the royal palace announced last December that the Duke of Palma would not take part in official ceremonies, which is a key role for members of the royal family. The royal household is widely respected for the king\u2019s role, as head of state, in guiding Spain to democracy after the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Also last December, the royal family publicly revealed its finances for the first time in an effort to boost public confidence and transparency. Then the king, in his annual Christmas address, issued a warning to public officials: \u201cFortunately, we live in a state of law, and any objectionable action should be tried and punished according to the law,\u201d the king said. \u201cJustice is for all.\u201d Correas said the king \u201cwas clearly referring to the Duke of Palma, distancing himself from the duke.\u201d Madrid\u2019s wax museum already has moved the image of Urdangarin away from the royal family. He now stands alone in the section for sports figures. Urdangarin will mount a vigorous defense, his lawyer, Mario Pascual Vives, told reporters earlier in Barcelona. \u201cI am still convinced that he is innocent,\u201d Pascual Vives said. \u201cAnd I have always said that her highness, Princess Cristina, is not involved in this at all.\u201d Urdangarin and the princess have lived with their children in Washington, D.C., in recent years. The testimony took place in a closed-door session, with no cameras allowed. In attendance were prosecutors, Urdangarin\u2019s defense lawyer and lawyers representing other suspects in the investigation. The attorneys for the other suspects \u2013 in addition to the investigating magistrate \u2013 will have a chance to question Urdangarin, according to state-run television TVE. The judge has not said publicly when the investigation might conclude. After that, the judge may set a trial, and indict suspects who currently face only preliminary charges, or clear these suspects of all charges."

But Tolgay Arslan equalized in the 56th minute to leave Moenchengladbach two points adrift of Dortmund, who face Hanover Sunday.

Thorsten Fink\u2019s Hamburg have moved up to eighth ahead of the weekend games. Meanwhile, Blackburn Rovers defender Christopher Samba has become the latest star player to sign for big-spending Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala. His English Premier League club confirmed the transfer Friday, with reports indicating a fee of approximately $18 million for the Congo international. The 27-year-old has not played for the struggling EPL side since asking for a transfer and was a rumored target for Tottenham and QPR.

U.S. Open champion McIlroy beat Ryder Cup colleague Miguel Angel Jimenez 3&1 at Dove Mountain, while Westwood marched into the quarterfinals with a 3&2 victory over Tiger Wood\u2019s conqueror Nick Watney. Watney found the Englishman in fine form as Westwood gained revenge for successive defeats to the American at the last two stagings of the event near Tucson. It was the first time Westwood has made the weekend play at the tournament, although he has a fine match play record for Europe in the Ryder Cup. \u201cI knew it was going to be a tough match against Nick.

        "content": "The publishing industry is buzzing with reports that \u201cHarry Potter\u201d author J.K. Rowling has made the switch from wizards to killers, after signing a new deal to write a book for adults. On Friday, Rowling (@jk_rowling) tweeted: \u201cAs you may have heard, I have a new book out later this year. Very different to Harry, although I\u2019ve enjoyed writing it every bit as much.\u201d Publishers Little, Brown announced it had snapped up the latest project from Rowling \u2013 one of the world\u2019s best-selling authors \u2013 who said she was looking forward to \u201cthis new phase of my writing life.\u201d  \u201cThe freedom to explore new territory is a gift that Harry\u2019s success has brought me, and with that new territory it seemed a logical progression to have a new publisher,\u201d she said in a statement. Rowling\u2019s choice of Little, Brown publisher David Shelley as editor has led to fevered discussion as to whether her new work will take the form of a murder mystery. \u201cThe rumor is that it\u2019s a crime thriller, and that it could be set in [her adopted home of] Edinburgh; there\u2019s no smoke without fire,\u201d Philip Jones, deputy editor of trade paper The Bookseller, told CNN. \u201cHer new editor, David Shelley, is known for his work with crime thrillers.\u201d Shelley also works with popular crime writers Val McDermid and Mark Billingham. After news of the deal broke, McDermid (@valmcdermid) tweeted: \u201cNice to see that JK Rowling has such good taste in editors\u2026\u201d suggesting to Billingham (@MarkBillingham): \u201cDo you think her choice [of David Shelley] means she\u2019s writing a thriller/crime novel?\u201d She later added: \u201cIt\u2019s a reasonable speculation that it\u2019s a mystery, since that\u2019s what David Shelley does so well\u2026\u201d And fellow crime writer Ian Rankin (@beathhigh) tweeted \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be funny if JK Rowling\u2019s first novel for adults turned out to be a crime story set in Edinburgh?\u201d Rankin, author of the best-selling \u201cRebus\u201d novels, themselves set in the city, jokingly added: \u201cMight explain why she left the neighbourhood (me, [Alexander] McCall Smith, [Kate] Atkinson near-neighbours) and moved across town. \u201cShe\u2019s certainly a fan of the traditional whodunnit.\u201d Jones said whatever form the new book takes, it is certain to provide a much-needed shot in the arm for the publishing industry. \u201cWhat the book trade needs desperately is \u2018event books\u2019 \u2013 high profile titles by famous authors, which get people going into bookshops to buy them, or even just to look at them, and then end up buying others. \u201cBut they are few and far between \u2013 they come up once or twice a year. This is the event book to blow all other event books out of the water.\u201d He said that the book\u2019s simultaneous publication as an ebook would be closely watched for clues to the health of the ebook market, and its impact on the \u201creal\u201d book market. \u201cThat has never happened before, either with Harry Potter or with other \u2018event titles,\u2019 and now that ebooks make up a 20th of the market, it will be fascinating to see if that has an impact \u2013 it really could be a game-changer.\u201d  Jones said it was unlikely Rowling would be able to repeat the massive success of the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books, the tales of a young wizard which have sold more than 400 million copies worldwide, and sparked a film franchise and a merchandizing empire. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be as big as Harry Potter, but Harry Potter was built up slowly over time \u2013 this, as far as we can tell from the press release, is a single book, and an adult book, so she will be looking for a new audience, and they may take some convincing.\u201d But he said it made sense for Rowling to make a fresh start, with her switch to writing for \u201cgrown-ups.\u201d \u201cHer writing has grown up, as have her readers: Most of the youngsters who read the first Harry Potter books when they came out are adults now, so she has a ready-made audience.\u201d"

Sixth seed Radwanska had earlier continued her fine recent form to beat Serbia\u2019s Jelena Jankovic 6-2 2-6 6-0 in the first semifinal. Goerges, whose passage through the draw was helped by the withdrawal of top seed Victoria Azarenka through injury, was rewarded for a display of attacking tennis.  \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to beat Caroline. I tried to stay aggressive and attack the short balls,\u201d Goerges told Eurosport. Goerges had beaten former World No.1 Wozniacki in their two previous matches, both on clay, with the Dane having the better in their other clashes on hard courts. She opened up an advantage in the opening set, but Wozniacki broke back to force a tiebreak, which Goerges largely dominated to win seven points to three. The second set followed a similar pattern of closely contested games, but Wozniacki looked set to level as she carved out a 4-2 lead. But a fruitless challenge on a line call disrupted her rhythm and Goerges broke back. A further break gave her a 6-5 lead and she served out for victory. The 22-year-old Radwanska will be a tough opponent for Goerges in Saturday\u2019s final after she saw off Jankovic in a topsy-turvy match. She swept through the decider without dropping a game to win after one hour 43 minutes.    "

Through his lawyer, Urdangarin has denied the charges.   No trial has been set in the case, which has riveted national attention. \u201cPeople can understand if politicians, businesses or unions do this, but when it happens in the royal family, that is a hard blow for all Spaniards,\u201d said Gerardo Correas, an expert on royal affairs who runs the International School of Protocol in Madrid. The investigation, officially secret, has been top news for months in Spain as details were reported. The court in Palma de Mallorca has publicly confirmed only the basic charge of misappropriation of public funds and named Urdangarin and some former associates as suspects. Urdangarin, an Olympic medalist in handball, led a private foundation that secured lucrative contracts from regional governments to promote sports and tourism. As the case gained notoriety, the royal palace announced last December that the Duke of Palma would not take part in official ceremonies, which is a key role for members of the royal family. The royal household is widely respected for the king\u2019s role \u2013 as head of state \u2013 in guiding Spain to democracy after the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Also last December, the royal family publicly revealed its finances for the first time in an effort to boost public confidence and transparency. Then the king, in his annual Christmas address, issued a warning to public officials. \u201cFortunately, we live in a state of law and any objectionable action should be tried and punished according to the law,\u201d the king said. \u201cJustice is for all.\u201d Correas said the king \u201cwas clearly referring to the Duke of Palma, distancing himself from the duke.\u201d Madrid\u2019s wax museum already has moved the image of Urdangarin away from the royal family. He now stands alone in the section for sports figures. Urdangarin will mount a vigorous defense, said his lawyer, Mario Pascual Vives. \u201cI am still convinced that he is innocent,\u201d Pascual Vives said. \u201cAnd I have always said that her highness, Princess Cristina, is not involved in this at all.\u201d Urdangarin and the princess have lived with their children in Washington, D.C., in recent years. Speculation was high earlier Friday about whether he would have to walk past cameras Saturday morning to enter the courthouse \u2013 as other suspects under investigation in the case have done \u2013 or whether he would enter in the courthouse in a vehicle, largely out of sight.  The court late Friday issued a statement announcing that Urdangarin will be allowed to enter the courthouse in a vehicle on an \u201cexceptional\u201d basis made strictly for security reasons.  Other suspects in the case have had to walk past cameras to enter the building. The testimony will be in a closed-door session, with no cameras allowed, in the investigating magistrate\u2019s chambers. Prosecutors and Urdangarin\u2019s defense lawyer would also attend. The judge has not said publicly when the investigation might conclude. After that, the judge may set a trial, and indict suspects who currently face only preliminary charges, or clear these suspects of all charges. "

        "content": "Carlo Ancelotti paid the ultimate price for failing to deliver trophies at Chelsea last season, being sacked by the English club\u2019s billionaire owner Roman Abramovich just hours after a defeat on the final day. The Italian is determined to avoid a similar fate at Paris Saint-Germain by guiding the big-spending French club back into the European Champions League \u2013 a competition where success proves ever elusive for Abramovich \u2013 for the first time since 2004. Ancelotti replaced the sacked Antoine Kombouare at the Parc des Princes in December, with PSG sitting top of France\u2019s Ligue 1. His appointment has been just one of many changes aimed at boosting the club\u2019s profile since the Qatar Investment Authority became PSG\u2019s majority shareholder in May 2011. The 52-year-old inherited an expensively-assembled squad including Argentina playmaker Javier Pastore, who signed from Italy\u2019s Palermo for a French record transfer fee. \u201cThe aim is to play the Champions League next year,\u201d Ancelotti, who won European club football\u2019s biggest prize as a player and coach with AC Milan, told CNN. \u201cI found the club at the top of the league and so I have to try to do the best to keep the club at the top of the league until the end of the season. But the aim is to play in the Champions League.\u201d Ancelotti fell out of favor at Stamford Bridge after failing to follow up the glory of his first season in charge, when he oversaw Chelsea\u2019s first Premier League and FA Cup double. After leading the Blues to second place in the league, he was axed in favor of one of football\u2019s rising stars \u2013 former Porto coach Andre Villas-Boas. The 34-year-old is now himself in danger of losing his job, having overseen Chelsea\u2019s worst run of results since Abramovich took charge in 2004, and is reportedly facing a player revolt over his team selections. The Blues are outside the qualification spots for next year\u2019s Champions League, and their hopes in this season\u2019s competition hang by a thread after losing 3-1 in the first leg of the last-16 tie away to Napoli on Tuesday. Villas-Boas was heavily criticized for starting with experienced England duo of Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole and Ghana\u2019s Michael Essien on the subs\u2019 bench in Naples \u2013 players who were key figures during Ancelotti\u2019s time at Chelsea. \u201cI think the problem at Chelsea was that they tried to change something, to have a team younger, to give less matches to the most important players Frank Lampard, Ashley Cole, John Terry,\u201d Ancelotti said. \u201cBut I think that this change needed time because it is very difficult to substitute players like Lampard, Cole and Terry because they are the players in Chelsea.\u201d Ancelotti\u2019s coaching staff at PSG includes former Chelsea midfielder Claude Makele, who won two Premier League titles in London under coach Jose Mourinho before moving to the French capital in 2008. \u201cIt makes me sad when I see Chelsea like this,\u201d the 39-year-old said. \u201cIn a team, you can\u2019t change five or six players. It\u2019s too much.  \u201cNow Chelsea lose a lot with a lot of experienced players on the bench. This is not fair.\u201d Fifth-placed Chelsea will seek to end a run of five games without a win in all competitions in the league match against Wigan on Saturday, while Ligue 1 leaders PSG travel to sixth-placed Lyon with a one-point advantage over Montpellier."

        "content": "Nick Watney sent former world No. 1 Tiger Woods packing in the second round of the WGC Match Play Championship in Arizona Thursday. Woods, who had to battle in his first-round win over Spain\u2019s Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano, again took the match against his fellow American to the final hole. Trailing one down, the 14-time major champion hit a superb approach to within 10 feet of the hole. Needing the putt to take the match to the 19th, Woods pushed it wide to hand his opponent victory.   \u201cI\u2019ve blocked my putts all day and I blocked that one. I didn\u2019t make any putts today and, subsequently, I didn\u2019t win the match,\u201d Woods said after his bid for a fourth title in the 64-man event ended early. \u201cI didn\u2019t miss a single shot coming in, which is good. And that was fun, to hit the ball that well. Unfortunately, I just didn\u2019t make a putt when I needed it.\u201d  Woods is still seeking his first win in a PGA Tour event since 2009, but has shown signs of a return to his best form since the start of the year.   \u201cWe don\u2019t see him miss putts like that very often,\u201d said Watney, who next faces world No. 3 Lee Westwood. \u201cAnd there were a few of them.\u201d  Westwood beat fellow former European No. 1 Robert Karlsson of Sweden 3 and 2, but has lost to the American for the past two years Arizona.  He can take the No. 1 ranking from fellow Englishman Luke Donald, beaten by Ernie Els in the first round, with victory come Sunday. Westwood won four of the first six holes but had to hold off a late rally from his opponent before booking a last-16 place. World No. 2 Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland also has his eyes on the top spot, and progressed comfortably with a 4 and 2 win over Anders Hansen of Denmark. The U.S. Open champion will next take on Spanish veteran Miguel Angel Jimenez, who beat in-form U.S. PGA Championship titleholder Keegan Bradley 2 and 1. Scottish pair Paul Lawrie and Martin Laird will play each other in the last 16 after more excellent play. Former British Open champion Lawrie followed up his first-round victory over England\u2019s Justin Rose by edging out 20-year-old Japanese star Ryo Ishikawa on the final green. Laird carded eight birdies against 18-year-old Italian Matteo Manassero on his way to a 2 and 1 victory. American Dustin Johnson had to battle back from three down to beat Ryder Cup teammate Jim Furyk in the first round, but enjoyed a 7 and 5 romp over Italian Francesco Molinari for the biggest win of the week so far. Johnson, seeded ninth, will next play 40th-ranked compatriot Mark Wilson \u2013 who won 3 and 2 against England\u2019s Robert Rock, winner of January\u2019s Abu Dhabi event where Woods made his season debut and tied for third. Another home hope, Steve Stricker, winner of the tournament in Australia in 2001, sank a 20-foot birdie putt on the last to see off former British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa. The 44-year-old world No. 5 will next face 21st-seeded compatriot Hunter Mahan, who thrashed former PGA Championship winner Y.E. Yang of South Korea 5 and 3. Els, having routed Donald 5 and 4, lost by the same score to Swede Peter Hanson and is facing an uphill battle to qualify for the Masters in April. Hanson, seeded 33rd, will take on Brandt Snedeker, who beat fellow American Kyle Stanley 2 & 1."

        "content": "With its palaces, sculpted parks, concert halls and museums, Vienna is a city steeped in culture.  Once home to composers including Beethoven, Mozart, and Johann Strauss, and to artists Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka and Egon Schiele, as well as the father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, Vienna has been at the forefront of major cultural movements for centuries.  But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s stuck in the past; Vienna has a youthful side, too, and is visited yearly by backpackers as much as mainline culture aficionados \u2013 something Richard Linklater celebrated in his 1995 film \u201cBefore Sunrise,\u201d which charted two strangers falling in love in the course of one day, with Vienna as the romantic backdrop.  Whether you visit in the winter for Christmas markets glittering under snowflakes, or in the spring when the flowers in the city\u2019s many parks are in bloom, the city is sure to charm.  CNN World\u2019s Treasures selects some of the best spots to experience \u201cOld World\u201d Vienna, from galleries and parks to historic landmarks. SEE 2012 marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of Austrian painter Gustav Klimt, one of the founding members of the Vienna Secession, an avant-garde artistic group at the turn of the century.  Indeed, one of the city\u2019s architectural masterpieces, the art nouveau Secession building, was commissioned by the group at as a haven for the latest in contemporary art.  The Museum features Klimt\u2019s Beethoven mural, but to see his famed golden-hued painting \u201cThe Kiss,\u201d head to the Belvedere Museum, housed in a magnificent palace built in the 1700s. It boasts a comprehensive collection of Klimt paintings, alongside works by Kokoschka, Schiele, Vincent van Gogh and Auguste Rodin among others.   Vienna\u2019s turn-of-the-century painters owed much to the new theories about the mind coming from Sigmund Freud, and no trip to Vienna would be complete without visiting the Sigmund Freud Museum, where the founder of psychoanalysis lived until he was forced to flee in 1938. Take in a lecture or simply wander around the original waiting room and imagine you are about to be examined by the great man himself.  For those looking to feast their eyes on earlier examples of the city\u2019s opulent past, look no further than the Schatzkammer, the imperial treasury and home to the Hapsburg Crown Jewels, which is located in the vast Hofburg Palace, seat of the ruling Hapsburg dynasty.  HEAR For lovers of classical music, Vienna is a must-visit, as it was in the eighteenth century, when it attracted the young Mozart.  You can visit the apartment Mozart lived in when he composed \u201cThe Marriage of Figaro\u201d among other great works, which has been turned into a museum and boasts temporary exhibitions, in addition to the permanent collection of objects in the house itself. You can even hear his music wafting through the rooms as you wander around.  For concerts, head to the Musikverein for performances by the Wiener Philharmoniker and smaller chamber concerts. Or for operas, book a seat at the grand Staatsoper, or the Theater-an-der-Wien, where works by Beethoven and Strauss originally premiered.  STROLL Vienna has a wealth of open spaces and parks, from the sculpted alpine gardens at the Belvedere Castle to the more laid-back, youthful feel of Danube Island. Rathauspark boasts an ice-skating rink in winter and an open-air cinema in summer. Alternatively, take a walk around the Baroque gardens at the Schonbrunn Palace. A well-worn tourist activity is to ride the Ferris wheel at the Prater Amusement Park, which features in the Graham Greene-penned noir film \u201cThe Third Man.\u201d  STAY Places to stay in Vienna are plentiful and cater to all budgets. The Hotel Altstadt is located in the arty Spittelberg district, just behind the MuseumsQuartier and features an impressive contemporary art and design collection; Das Tyrol, a cozy former monastery with a small spa, features art works by young Viennese artists; the Konig von Ungarn has the benefit of being in the same complex of 300-year-old buildings as Mozart\u2019s one-time living quarters; and the Hilton Vienna Danube has views over the river.  EAT Viennese cuisine is not for those watching their waistlines; mouth-watering pastries and cakes, breaded meats and beer and wine a-plenty make the city a feast for the taste-buds. Steirereck serves an impressive, if also not exactly slimming array of delicious Viennese dishes, while Demel serves coffee and cakes for an afternoon treat in-between sightseeing. "

United led 2-0 from the first leg in Amsterdam last week and looked set to cruise through when Javier Hernandez put them ahead with a well-taken early goal. But Ajax leveled the match later in the first half through a low shot from Aras Ozbiliz and when Toby Alderweireld headed them with four minutes to go United were rocking. Alex Ferguson\u2019s men had thrown away leads during their failure to qualify from the group stages of the Champions League and this was another reminder. But they were able to play out time to lose 2-1 on the night but go through 3-2 on aggregate and will face Athletic Bilboa in the next round. Ferguson admitted his youthful selection had nearly cost them their passage through. \u201cI must say, I\u2019ve got to accept I\u2019m responsible for picking the team and tonight I picked too many young players in the back four positions \u2013 that was a big problem in terms of experience.

        "content": "Europe\u2019s top human rights watchdog has urged Germany to stop offering sexual offenders the option of surgical castration. The Council of Europe\u2019s anti-torture committee said in a report issued Wednesday that the practice, which aims to help convicted sex criminals rein in their sex drives and lower their risk of reoffending, could easily be regarded as \u201cdegrading treatment.\u201d According to Germany\u2019s 1969 Law on Voluntary Castration, a person over the age of 25 may be subjected to surgical castration if he \u201cdisplays an abnormal sex drive, which \u2026 gives reason to suspect that he will commit one or more criminal offenses.\u201d The controversial procedure is not mandatory and a consensual offender can only have the operation after being informed of all the implications of the decision and after medical approval has been obtained, Germany said in its response, adding that it would consider reviewing the issue. But Berlin also cited the treatment\u2019s effectiveness, saying that of the 104 people who underwent the procedure in the 1970s, only three people committed sexual crimes again.  Nearly half of the 53 others who refused or were denied treatment eventually reoffended. Voluntary castration is still very rare in Germany, with fewer than five cases per year in the last decade. The only other country in the 47-nation bloc of the Council of Europe that offers the process is the Czech Republic, which has also been the subject of criticism in recent years for allowing sex offenders to opt for castration, a procedure it uses far more frequently than Germany.

But the 2003 U.S. Open winner\u2019s form has declined over the last 12 months, his latest defeat coming on Wednesday when he was beaten 7-6 (10-8) 7-5 by Belgium\u2019s Xavier Malisse in the first round of the Memphis event. Four-time grand slam finalist Roddick has struggled for fitness in 2012. The 29-year-old sprained his ankle in San Jose last week having already been forced to pull out of last month\u2019s Australian Open at the second-round stage with a hamstring injury. But despite his recent injury troubles, the current world No. 27 refused to feel sorry for himself after his first career loss to Malisse \u2013 who will play Germany\u2019s Benjamin Becker in the second round. \u201cI hit the ball okay, I just didn\u2019t hit it well when I had to,\u201d Roddick, who last year finished outside of the top 10 for the first time in 10 years, told the ATP World Tour\u2019s official website. \u201cI had nine, ten years of a pretty clean bill of health overall. I think for me to feel too sorry for myself now, it probably wouldn\u2019t be okay. \u201cI know Mardy (Fish), for instance, had wrist surgeries in the middle of his career, 22, 23-years-old, so I didn\u2019t have that. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019m really dealing with anything significant.\u201d While Roddick is on the decline, 21-year-old Canadian Raonic is the rising star of men\u2019s tennis. Fresh from defending his SAP Open title in San Jose last week, the fourth seed recorded a 6-2 7-6 (7-3) victory over Latvia\u2019s Ernests Gulbis. But Raonic, the only man to have won two Tour titles in 2012, said he was disappointed with aspects of his performance after setting up a clash with the Ukraine\u2019s Sergiy Stakhovsky. \u201cThe match was good,\u201d said the world No. 35. \u201cI felt like I did the things I needed to. I don\u2019t feel I played my best, but as the match progressed I got better and better, and really everything just went my way.  \u201cI played the big points well and built from there. I\u2019m happy to be able to get through and have another chance to play better tomorrow.\u201d Czech No. 3 seed Radek Stepanek ended a four-match losing streak with a 6-3 6-2 win over American qualifier Bobby Reynolds. Another home-crowd favorite awaits Stepanek in the second round, after Ryan Sweeting got the better of compatriot and former world No. 4 James Blake. Uzbekistan\u2019s Denis Istomin, who lost to Raonic in the San Jose final, was beaten by Austrian Jurgen Melzer, while seventh seed Kevin Anderson defeated American Robby Ginepri."

But look closer. There are no signs and no distinguishing features to help those who don\u2019t know what lies on the other side of these battered doorways. The chances are you will have stumbled over a marfish \u2013 the cafes British Somalis come to chew the vegetable stimulant, khat. Although khat is legal in the UK, marfishes are closed off to outsiders. One marfish we attempted to enter had a surveillance camera overlooking the locked doorway \u2013 we were repeatedly refused entry. See high-res gallery of years of chaos in Somalia In the past, journalists have been attacked for attempting to report on the goings-on inside the cafes. For years, marfishes are been believed to be at the center of criminal activity, and now, CNN has learned, they may also be a recruiting ground for Islamic militants. Abubakr Awale is an anti-khat campaigner in the UK, and knows only too well the paranoia and isolation khat addiction engenders in the young men in the marfishes. Seven years ago he was one of them. \u201cYoung people become vulnerable, not clearly thinking and the paranoia kicks in and that\u2019s when they start to hate the British public \u2013 especially the police,\u201d Awale told us. \u201cThey are thinking everybody is out to get them and that\u2019s exactly the kind of individuals the likes of Al-Shabaab are targeting.\u201d The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) estimates that Britons now make up a quarter of foreign fighters in Somalia, and says Al-Shabaab is stepping up its effort to make the most of this fertile recruiting ground. \u201cThey are moving forward, changing their techniques,\u201d Awale says, \u201cso it\u2019s no longer the Masjids and in the Madrasas they are targeting. There have been some cases here in the UK where the young people have been taken away from marfishes back to Somalia. There are now young people in the marfishes as we speak who are missing and we don\u2019t know where they are.\u201d The families of many of these young men were too afraid to speak to us but CNN has confirmed that as recently as last month two young men aged 18 and 20 have been reported missing in London. Both were khat addicts and both their families are convinced they have been recruited to fight by Al-Shabaab. And that \u2013 as one relative told us \u2013 is effectively a death sentence. Fertile territory for Al-Shabaab in chaos of Somalia The British-Somali community is one of the UK\u2019s oldest immigrant communities, tracing their roots to seamen who traveled to the UK in the 19th century. But they have also had one of the most difficult experiences of integration. According to the British government\u2019s own figures, British-Somalis have the highest unemployment rates of any immigrant community, only 50 percent have any educational qualifications, with only 3 percent gaining higher education qualifications. Unemployment especially feeds into the cycle of depression, addiction and alienation that extremists prey on. It is not just in the marfishes that young Somalis are being targeted for radicalization; the internet is now a treasure trove for radicals and Al-Shabaab boasts of having dozens of recruiters online at all hours in pro-jihad internet forums, even tailoring their videos in English to their target audience. Even those families who know their children are safely at home are not immune from extremists. One Somali mother we interviewed, whose son was recruited by Al-Shabaab online, told us her experience is an all too common one in the British Somali community. \u201cMy son was a good outgoing boy, active, loved by many people. He started changing by becoming addicted to the internet, [he went on] many different sites like YouTube and Facebook. I started noticing a change in him, he started saying: \u2018Mum, take me abroad to study Islam.\u2019 I supported him as any mother would. I took him to Nairobi. After weeks staying in the school he disappeared; little did I know he had already been planning this.\u201d She asked that we not identify her: she says although she was able to convince him to leave Somalia she still lives in fear that either the British authorities or the militant group itself will one day come after him.   She told us she hopes other parents will be able to guard their children from what happened to hers. But it\u2019s not just her experience that is a common one, the fear she lives with is also shared by many of the British-Somalis we spoke to. Only a handful would allow us to film them and most were suspicious of how their stories would be used. Even those who had no direct experience or involvement with extremism were terrified that on any given night they might get a knock on the door from a police officer accusing them of terrorism or \u2013 worse still \u2013 an e-mail or a voicemail threat from Al-Shabaab for being \u201cun-Islamic\u201d or a \u201ctraitor.\u201d To an outsider like me, none of these fears seem founded, but for Somalis in the UK much of what they thought they\u2019d left behind in their war-ravaged homeland appears to have followed them here. And as the world finally moves to act cohesively on Somalia, many of them no longer believe that anywhere is truly safe."

Vettel, F1\u2019s youngest two-time champion having won the drivers\u2019 crown in 2010 and 2011, also expects this season\u2019s title race to be much tighter, after he took the checkered flag in 11 of 19 grands prix last year. \u201cLast season the way we incorporated the exhaust was very cleverly devised,\u201d the 24-year-old told the sport\u2019s official website. \u201cIt made the car faster by generating more grip, but it\u2019s a thing of the past in 2012 and for now we have to live with it.  \u201cI would say that goes for all the other teams as well.

My guess is that the performance of the cars will be even closer this year, especially the gap between the front-running teams and the midfield. We will probably even see a few surprises.\u201d If the German could take the championship in 2012, he would join Argentina\u2019s Juan Manuel Fangio and compatriot and seven-time title winner Michael Schumacher as the only men to have won the sport\u2019s biggest prize three years in a row. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware that only two drivers have done it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as the saying goes, three\u2019s a charm, so let\u2019s try to do it again this year!\u201d Vettel will be in distinguished company on the grid when the season begins in Australia next month, with six former world champions competing in the same season for the first time. Alongside him will be Schumacher at Mercedes, McLaren\u2019s title-winning British duo of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button, Ferrari\u2019s two-time winner Fernando Alonso and the returning 2007 champion Kimi Raikkonen at Lotus. \u201cAs it has never happened before, it is something very special,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to be one of those six feels even better. But then again, this is something that points to the past and has nothing to do with the next 20 races, as it doesn\u2019t make you any faster.  \u201cIt is a new game when we start on the Melbourne grid. Past glory is great to have, but you have to make sure that it reaches into the here and now.\u201d The forthcoming season is scheduled to be the longest in the elite division of motorsport\u2019s 52-year history, with 20 races on the calendar. Vettel was not overly concerned by the addition of an extra race, with the U.S. Grand Prix returning in Austin in November, but he felt no further additions should be made to the schedule in the future. \u201cTwenty races is indeed a huge workload but to be honest whether it\u2019s 19 or 20 races doesn\u2019t make any real difference. There are few sports with such a long season, so I would suggest that we all just roll up our sleeves. \u201cI think it will be important to pace yourself cleverly and you will probably have to use the phrase \u2018thanks, but no thanks\u2019 more often. You can\u2019t have your finger in every pie, however alluring it may look.\u201d "

        "content": "\u201cThe letter stated that, as I ran through the tunnel, they were going to throw acid in my face. I was petrified and I probably never moved so much and so fast on a soccer field in my life.\u201d Clyde Best is one of football\u2019s pioneers \u2013 the first black player of the modern era to establish himself in England\u2019s top division. The reaction he faced from fans on the terraces more than 40 years ago was extreme, mirroring the strong resistance to immigrants landing on Britain\u2019s shores back then. Recent incidents have shown that racism is still a big problem in these more multicultural times. World football\u2019s president, Sepp Blatter, infamously claimed last year that racism is not an issue on the pitch, but he has been proved sadly wrong. England, in particular, is dealing with the fallout of two high-profile player on player controversies. Fans, meanwhile, have been arrested for racially abusing players at stadiums and on the Internet. Racial tension started growing in the UK after World War Two, when immigrants began pouring into the country from the British Empire\u2019s colonies around the world \u2013 notably the West Indies. The number of non-whites in England climbed from just a few thousand in 1945 to about 1.45 million in 1970. Just two years before that, Conservative politician Enoch Powell warned of \u201crivers of blood\u201d because of increasing immigration. Also in 1968, Best arrived from his native Bermuda to play for London club West Ham United. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t used to seeing people of color on the field in those days. I was always taught that you\u2019re not playing for yourself, you\u2019re playing for the people who are coming behind you, and that\u2019s what kept me going,\u201d Best told CNN. \u201cThere were certain things that were said and done, but you\u2019ve got to put them in them in the back of your mind and be strong and do what you have to do.\u201d  Defining a country Best\u2019s persistence in coping with the hate mail and the fan abuse \u2013 some of it from his own club\u2019s supporters \u2013 helped paved the way for Viv Anderson, England\u2019s first black international. Back in the 1920s, London-born Jack Leslie was denied the chance to represent his country due to his Jamaican parentage. At the time English football was very much a sport for the working class, largely played by the working class, and had been since the sport\u2019s founding days in the 1860s. \u201cAs the game became more popular it was the beginning of the industrial revolution in England,\u201d says English players\u2019 union chief executive Gordon Taylor. \u201cWorkers were attracted to the big cities and as a result all of the heavy industries, with steel and ship building and coal mining for example. Workers had their Saturday afternoons off and it became their recreation.\u201d Making history On November 29, 1978, Nottingham-born Anderson stepped onto the hallowed turf of England\u2019s national stadium, Wembley, to represent his country against the former Czechoslovakia \u2013 which, like its Eastern European neighbors, has also had problems with racist factions at football matches. The England manager was Ron Greenwood, who also brought Best to West Ham. \u201cTo play for your country and for 100,000 people at home against the Czechs, who had a good reputation then, you don\u2019t want to let yourself down, let your parents down, let the people you know down,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThe black thing never came into my head one bit. It was about being a professional footballer.\u201d Anderson won the European Cup twice with Nottingham Forest, but it was three men at another club, West Bromwich Albion, who really pushed black players into the spotlight in England. Raising the bar Cyrille Regis, Brendon Batson and Laurie Cunningham were dubbed the \u201cThree Degrees\u201d by their manager Ron Atkinson after a visit to the club\u2019s ground by the U.S. female vocal group. \u201cTo see three black players on one team was very radical,\u201d Regis recalls. \u201cWest Brom fans were fantastic. They took to us fantastically, supported us, appreciated us. At the end of the day they want anybody out there to play football and to play football well.\u201d Batson notes that Powell\u2019s political constituency was Wolverhampton and he delivered his infamous speech in Birmingham \u2013 both cities being near neighbors to the trio\u2019s adopted Midlands town. \u201cPeople said to me that as black players come to the fore in the early \u201970s, that was almost an opportunity for those racist groups \u2013 the BNP, the National Front \u2013 to come out and vent their fury at black players,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe football authorities did nothing about it, so for the black players coming through and particularly when I was at West Brom, we would seem to get the brunt of it because there were three of us and the volume was quite astonishing at times.  \u201cIt wasn\u2019t pleasant. What it did to you was almost galvanize us, to say, \u2018This is our profession, this is our career. We\u2019re not going to be driven away so we\u2019ll see you next week, next month, next year,\u2019 and that\u2019s it, we get on with it.\u201d Targeting the trouble-makers British hooliganism reached arguably its worst levels in 1985 with the Heysel Stadium disaster, which left 39 Juventus fans dead after fighting broke out before the European Cup final against Liverpool. English clubs were banned from European competition for five years. That heralded a major government crackdown on football violence, and subsequent laws have made racist behavior illegal at matches.  \u201cThe game was in danger of being written off,\u201d PFA chief Taylor says. \u201cThe prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, was thinking of insisting that people needed an ID card to even go to a game. That\u2019s how serious it was.\u201d This season a Liverpool fan was arrested for racially abusing an opposing team\u2019s player in an FA Cup match, and clubs have resorted to increasingly sophisticated security measures to catch offenders. Trial by technology With closed-circuit television footage and stewards wearing head-mounted cameras, it is now much more difficult for spectators to misbehave at games. \u201cThey get football banning orders which are draconian, but they have a very strong effect,\u201d says Chris Baker, safety officer at second division club Brighton.  \u201cA person could be banned for three years from entering any Football League ground, they also have to hand in their passport, they\u2019re not allowed to travel on the rail network when certain teams are playing, they\u2019re not allowed to travel out of the country when England is playing.  \u201cIt\u2019s a very strict measure, but it is spelling out to these people that it isn\u2019t tolerated by anyone in football. We have 75 cameras based around the ground and should any racist abuse be reported to us we could very quickly potentially get one, two, maybe three cameras onto an area.\u201d The way ahead England\u2019s Premier League is now one of the most multicultural divisions in the world, attracting players from far and wide. But while many people believe that the situation \u2013 in England at least \u2013 has improved, campaigners such as ant-racism Kick It Out group say there is still a lot of work to be done. \u201cWe want football in this country to be played, managed, administered and watched by the cross section of England,\u201d says Kick it Out\u2019s Danny Lynch.  \u201cWe don\u2019t have that. We\u2019ve got no openly gay players, we\u2019ve got two black managers from 92 clubs (now three following the appointment this week of Keith Curle at lower league Notts County), very few Asian players and a lack of women at boardroom levels.  \u201cSo there\u2019s an imbalance there and I think the work we do with all of the clubs and all of the agencies is try to address that in some way.\u201d Remembering what\u2019s most important Liverpool\u2019s Luis Suarez has already served an eight-match ban for racially abusing Manchester United\u2019s Patrice Evra last October, while Chelsea\u2019s John Terry has been stripped of the England captaincy ahead of a July court case in which he faces charges of similarly denigrating a black opponent. Best, for one, hopes that the world\u2019s most popular sport can focus on living up to its name \u2013 \u201cthe beautiful game.\u201d \u201cI think the most important thing to remember about soccer, with all of the foolishness that is going on with the racism and stuff like that, the minute a goal is scored, I can be as black as the ace of spades or I can be as white as a snow flake \u2026 the minute a goal is scored, everybody hugs one another.  \u201cThe most important thing to remember is that the ball doesn\u2019t care what color you are.\u201d"

        "content": "Tiger Woods battled into the second round of the WGC Match Play Championship in Arizona Wednesday with a last-hole win over Spaniard Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano. Woods is searching for his first win on the PGA Tour since 2009 at an event he has won three times, but neither player was at their best in a topsy-turvy match. Fernandez-Castano, making his debut in the elite 64-strong field, birdied the first two holes to go two up before 14-time major winner Woods hit back to win three holes in four.  The American missed a short par putt on the ninth to go two up before his opponent hit back as Woods went double bogey-bogey at the 10th and 11th to fall behind again. Woods squared the match with a birdie at the par-four 15th and took the lead with a par at the short 16th.  One-up playing the last, Woods had to conjure a miraculous escape from a bunker to salvage his par and close out the match. He will next play fellow American Nick Watney, who was a convincing winner over British Open champion Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland by 5 and 4. \u201cWe had some big (momentum) swings,\u201d Woods told Sky Sports. \u201cI\u2019m very fortunate to  move on.\u201d The big shock of the first round saw world No. 1 and defending champion Luke Donald thrashed 5 and 4 by South African veteran Ernie Els. Donald was below his best while former No. 1 Els, the lowest-ranked player in the field after being called in when Phil Mickelson pulled out, holed a string of putts to close out the match and progress to the last 32.   Donald could now lose his top spot if Rory McIlroy or Lee Westwood win the tournament. No. 2 McIlroy beat South Africa\u2019s George Coetzee 2 up to set up a clash with Denmark\u2019s Anders Hansen, who romped to a 5 and 3 win over South Korea\u2019s Kyung-Tae Kim. Westwood, who lost his No. 1 ranking at this event last year, beat Belgium\u2019s Nicolas Colsaerts 3 and 1 to earn a match against Sweden\u2019s Robert Karlsson \u2013 who like the Englishman has topped the European money list during his career. U.S. PGA champion Keegan Bradley beat 2006 and 2009 Match Play winner Geoff Ogilvy of Australia 4 and 3. \u201cI played about as good as I can,\u201d said the in-form Bradley, who next faces veteran Miguel Angel Jimenez \u2013 conqueror of his fellow Spaniard Sergio Garcia. Youngsters Ryo Ishikawa of Japan and Italian Matteo Manassero also went through after beating FedEx Cup series winner Bill Haas  and PGA Tour money list runner-up Webb Simpson respectively. Ishikawa, 20, will next face Martin Laird, whose fellow Scot Paul Lawrie \u2013 winner of the Qatar Open this month and a former British Open champion \u2013 will play 18-year-old Manassero. England\u2019s Robert Rock, who held off Woods to win in Abu Dhabi last month, continued his fine form this season with a 1-up win over Australian world No. 8 Adam Scott to mark his first appearance in a WGC event.

Bayern, the runners-up two seasons ago and four-time European champions, will still be hoping to make the final of the continent\u2019s top club competition, which will be held at the German side\u2019s home Allianz Stadium on May 19. But with only three wins in seven games since Christmas, and a run of 240 minutes without a goal, Jupp Heynckes\u2019 team will need to improve in the home leg on March 13. \u201cWe only seem to win when we take the lead in the first half. If we don\u2019t, it turns out like tonight. It\u2019s just not happening for us at the moment,\u201d said goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Stocker struck in the 86th minute to stun the Bavarian giants, giving the Swiss side a precious advantage. Bayern might have been on the score sheet early at the St. Jakob Stadium, but home goalkeeper Yann Sommer twice denied Franck Ribery in a frantic opening. But Basel, who had accounted for English powerhouses Manchester United in the group stages, also went close to a breakthrough. Blog: Should Man City accept Tevez apology? Defender Aleksandar Dragovic forced Neuer into a reflex save and Alexander Frei rattled the crossbar from close range. Sommer continued his excellent night as he kept out a curling shot from David Alaba on the half-hour mark. Basel captain Marco Streller wasted a good chance just after the break when he  headed straight at Neuer, but it was Bayern who gained the upper hand and appeared to be headed for at least a draw. Then with four minutes left, Cameroon striker Jacques Zoua picked out Stocker, who had been left clear by poor Bayern defending, and he shot underneath Neuer. Serie A giants Inter must have also thought they were heading for a goalless draw at the Stade Velodrome until Ghana\u2019s Andre Ayew popped up to head home for Marseille in the 93rd minute. It was the seventh game without a win for the Italians under Claudio Ranieri, who was left to rue his side\u2019s luck. \u201cWe played a good match, in which we created more chances than them, and we didn\u2019t deserve to leave beaten,\u201d the Inter manager told the match broadcaster.

        "content": "One of Northern Ireland\u2019s biggest and most expensive terrorist trials ended Wednesday with 12 of 13 defendants cleared of all charges against them, including murder, kidnapping and having guns. The suspected members of the pro-British or loyalist paramilitary group the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) were being tried at Belfast Crown Court on the word of two self-confessed UVF members, brothers David and Robert Stewart. Nine of the accused were acquitted of murdering paramilitary leader Tommy English in October 2000. The 40-year-old Ulster Defence Association (UDA) member was gunned down in front of his wife and young children on Halloween night during a bloody feud between rival groups. The Stewart brothers admitted to their part in English\u2019s killing and agreed to testify to get a reduced sentence. The so-called \u201csupergrass\u201d non-jury trial started in September 2011 but Wednesday ended with the judge branding the prosecution witnesses \u201cunreliable.\u201d Justice John Gillen said the Stewarts were \u201cruthless terrorists who had lived on a daily diet of lies.\u201d Up to 200 people including armed police were in the courtroom, and supporters cheered when the not guilty verdicts were read out. A spokesman for the UVF-linked Progressive Unionist Party, Ken Wilkinson, said the proceedings had been \u201ca show trial\u201d which had cost \u201cin the region of 20 million pounds\u201d (approximately $31 million).  He added, \u201cThe supergrass system failed in the 1980s and it has failed today.\u201d Supergrass is a slang term for an informer. The one defendant convicted of any offenses was found guilty of possession of a sledgehammer intended for use in terrorism and intending to pervert justice. One of those cleared of murder is alleged loyalist leader Mark Haddock, who had been accused of ordering the death of UDA boss English. Haddock, aged 43, had been named as a police agent in a 2007 report on the UVF by former Northern Ireland police ombudsman Nuala O\u2019Loan. O\u2019Loan said a UVF gang based in the Mount Vernon estate in north Belfast had been involved in up to 15 murders and that the Northern Ireland police special branch unit had allowed informers within the Mount Vernon group to act with impunity. The Ulster Volunteer Force and Ulster Defence Association were responsible for the killings of hundreds of people during the conflict between pro-British and pro-Irish forces in Northern Ireland over a 30-year period known as the Troubles. Most of their victims were Catholic civilians. The groups have remained active since the signing of the Good Friday peace agreement in 1998. "

The bodies were all found on a part of the ship known as bridge four, which is under water, Italian civil protection officials said. The discoveries raise the number of confirmed dead to 25, with seven people still missing. The cruise liner struck rocks and turned on its side January 13 off the Italian island of Giglio. Four of the bodies were recovered Wednesday, including those of a woman, man and little girl, civil protection officials said. They have not been identified. Five-year-old Italian girl Dayana Arlotti is among those unaccounted for after the wreck.  Because of deteriorating weather conditions, rescuers from the Italian fire brigade halted recovery operations for Wednesday, officials said.  Meanwhile, seven more people \u2013 four Concordia officers and three Costa employees \u2013 are under investigation, prosecutor Francesco Verusio said.

The seven have not been charged, detained or arrested, Verusio said. They are suspected of committing multiple manslaughter, shipwreck and failing to alert maritime authorities. \u201cThe establishment of the truth is essential in order for justice to be done in the first instance for the victims but also with regards to our crew and indeed the entire company,\u201d Costa said in a statement. \u201cWe have complete faith in the judicial system and we have offered our fullest collaboration to the authorities from the very beginning.  \u201cWe have no doubt that (the) professionalism of our company, as well as the ability of our onboard and ashore people to cope with this extraordinary emergency, will be recognized.\u201d Schettino remains under house arrest while investigators examine possible charges against him.

The captain faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship in connection with the wreck.  Schettino has said managers of the cruise line instructed him to sail close to the island and has denied allegations that he was sailing too fast. He has said the rock the ship struck was not indicated on his charts of the area. \u201cWe believe the placing other Costa personnel under investigation is simply due to the necessity for the authorities to provide such individuals with the guarantees afforded to everybody under Italian law, especially in view of the special evidentiary hearing that will commence in the coming days,\u201d Costa said.

Strauss-Kahn had been urging authorities since September to question him over his alleged involvement in the ring, saying it would help clear his name. His attorneys released a statement in November saying Strauss-Kahn wanted to address the so-called \u201cmedia lynching\u201d that he said falsely linked him to sex parties with prostitutes in Europe and the United States.

The prostitution probe, nicknamed the \u201cCarlton Affair\u201d by the French press, kicked off in October.

Authorities are also investigating whether corporate funds may have been used to pay for the prostitutes. In the Europe1 interview, Le Clerc said there was no evidence that such funds had been misappropriated. A hotel manager and four other men were arrested last year in connection with the investigation. Strauss-Kahn has not been arrested or charged in connection with the Carlton Affair, but the incident continues a string of sexual allegations against him. A French writer has accused him of attempted rape. Tristane Banon alleged a 2003 attack, when she was 23, but it was not pursued because of a statute of limitations. Strauss-Kahn denied the allegation and has filed a countersuit in France, alleging slander."

        "content": "Occupy London protesters who have been camped outside the landmark St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral for the past four months lost their court bid to avoid eviction Wednesday in a decision made by London\u2019s Court of Appeal. Last month, the High Court ruled in favor of the City of London Corporation, the body that runs London\u2019s financial district, which applied for an eviction order after the protesters failed to abide by a previous order to pack up the camp. The Occupy London group then filed an appeal against the ruling at the Court of Appeal. Wednesday, the three judges of the court refused them the permission to appeal.  Michael Paget, the lawyer representing the Occupy London group, said the group doesn\u2019t intend to file another legal challenge.  \u201cThe occupy message has been heard and will continue to be heard. It has made a difference and will continue to make a difference.\u201d  The activists, who set up camp outside the cathedral October 15, had been protesting against corporate greed and economic inequality. Many of the tents set up by the Occupy activists around St. Paul\u2019s are on what the corporation designates as a public road. St. Paul\u2019s suspended its own legal action against the activists in November, after a number of senior cathedral figures resigned over the threat to evict them. \u201cPeaceful protest is a democratic right but the camp is clearly in breach of highway and planning law,\u201d said Stuart Fraser, policy chairman for the City of London Corporation.\u201d I would call on protesters to comply with the decision of the courts and remove their tents and equipment voluntarily right away.\u201d"

England national manager Fabio Capello resigned this month after a meeting with English Football Association chairman David Bernstein.  Capello had openly criticized on Italian TV the English FA\u2019s decision to remove John Terry as England captain. Terry, who is accused of racially abusing another player during a match, will go on trial July 9 following the Euro 2012 finals. The case stems from comments the Chelsea footballer allegedly made to Queens Park Rangers player Anton Ferdinand in an English Premier League match last year.  Alison Saunders, chief crown prosecutor for London, said Terry is being prosecuted for a \u201cracially aggravated public order offense\u201d because of the comments during the October 23 match. The maximum penalty for the offense is \u00a32,500 (about $3,950). The London-born defender has denied the allegations.  Cameron says recent events highlight the need to end \u201call forms of discrimination.\u201d The FA, the Premier League and every club has signed onto a charter to \u201cTackle Homophobia and Transphobia in Sport.\u201d In another case last year, Liverpool\u2019s Luis Suarez was suspended and fined for racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra. Suarez was suspended for eight matches and fined \u00a340,000 ($63,000), England\u2019s Football Association announced in December. Evra said Suarez repeatedly shouted a racial slur at him during the October 15 match and demanded that Suarez be held accountable. Suarez did not specify what he said, but said it wasn\u2019t offensive. And his club issued a statement saying  it was \u201cvery surprised and disappointed\u201d with the decision. Racist taunts, alleged and proven, have dogged English football for years.  In January, police arrested a man on suspicion of making a racially abusive gesture at a high-profile soccer match between Liverpool and Manchester United. Earlier that month, Merseyside police arrested a 20-year-old man on \u201csuspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offense\u201d following a Liverpool match against Oldham."

After Arsenal\u2019s 4-0 thumping in Milan last week, Chelsea had an ideal opportunity to restore some pride for English clubs against Serie A opposition. And they got off to a superb start on a wet evening in southern Italy, by taking a 27th-minute lead. Villas Boas - Chelsea owners backing me in private Dean Sturridge broke on the right for the visitors but his ball into the penalty area should have been dealt with by the Napoli defense. However, Paolo Cannavaro sliced his attempted clearance up in the air and Spanish international Juan Mata was lurking behind the defender to side-foot his shot past goalkeeper Morgan De Sanctis. However, both defenses looked vulnerable in difficult conditions and it was no surprise when the home side leveled just 11 minutes later. Argentine striker Lavezzi collected the ball on the edge of the box and jinked inside Chelsea\u2019s Raul Meireles before curling a sublime shot into the corner of Peter Cech\u2019s net. And, Napoli completed their turnaround in stoppage time at the end of the first half when Gokhan Inler\u2019s deep cross was bundled home by Cavani, who had drifted in behind the Chelsea defense. Both sides wasted opportunities to score in an end-to-end second half, but it was Napoli who found the net again with a third goal in the 65th minute. David Luiz failed to deal with a long ball out of the Napoli defense and allowed Cavani to nip ahead of him. The Uruguayan did superbly to steady himself and slide the ball across for the on-rushing Lavezzi to stroke him his second to double Napoli\u2019s lead. A poor night for Chelsea could have become worse late on, when Ashley Cole\u2019s goalline clearance deprived Christian Maggio of scoring a fourth goal which would surely have sealed Napoli\u2019s qualification into the quarterfinals. Chelsea have now gone five matches without a victory as speculation continues over the future of under-pressure manager Andre Villas Boas. And the result also means the very real possibility of no English sides reaching the last eight of the competition for the first time since 1996.    "

Wernbloom, making his debut for the club following his recent transfer from Dutch club AZ Alkmaar, was on hand to fire home from close range in the third minute of injury time, after Alexei Berezutsky\u2019s cross from the left had caused uncertainty in the Real Madrid defense. The goal came somewhat against the run of play, with Jose Mourinho\u2019s side appearing to comfortably deal with both the extreme weather and the artificial pitch in the Luzhniki Stadium. Real came into the match in sparkling domestic form, holding a 10-point lead over rivals Barcelona in the Spanish La Liga title race. And they began well in front of a partisan 63,000 crowd, with home keeper Sergei Chepchugov pulling off a great double save from Gonzalo Higuain and Sami Khedira. However, Chepchugov could do nothing to prevent the visitors taking a 28th-minute lead, as Ronaldo found the net with a powerful drive after Zoran Tosic failed to clear Fabio Coentrao\u2019s cross from the left. The second half proved a cagey affair, although CSKA\u2019s Japanese midfielder Keisuke Honda tested goalkeeper Iker Casillas with a fierce free-kick. And, with time nearly up, Wernbloom pounced to deny Madrid victory \u2013 although the nine-times champions are still the heavy favorites to progress to the quarterfinals following the second leg in two weeks\u2019 time.   Mourinho told reporters: \u201cCSKA are difficult opponents and this was a difficult match.

        "content": "The Prado Museum put on display for public viewing Tuesday a restored version of what is thought to be the earliest known copy of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cMona Lisa\u201d masterpiece, which hangs in the Louvre Museum in Paris. Many copies of \u201cMona Lisa\u201d were painted years after the fact, but this copy is different, experts say, because evidence shows it was painted at the same time and in the same studio as the original masterpiece, probably by one of Leonardo\u2019s assistants or pupils. The copy shows the same woman and the same landscape, the Prado Museum said in a statement.  But the restored copy may depict the woman in a more youthful and vibrant fashion, some art experts said, because the original masterpiece has been dulled by layers of cracked varnish and there are no known plans to restore it as well. Mona Lisa: The theft that created a legend \u201cThis copy is now one of the most important sources of information for working procedures in Leonardo\u2019s studios,\u201d the Prado said in a statement. \u201cThe first thing to notice is that the copy is in remarkably good condition and we think that it\u2019s a rather faithful rendition of the original,\u201d Gabriele Finaldi, the Prado\u2019s deputy director told CNN. \u201cI think it has a lot to offer regarding the understanding of the original in the Louvre, particularly in the landscape and in the head dress, and details of the face and hands.\u201d The copy will be on display at the Prado through March 12, when it will be sent to the Louvre to be shown in an exhibition on Leonardo, starting March 29. Both the original and the copy were painted 500 years ago, but what art experts consider to be the exciting details about the copy occurred only recently. The copy has been in Spanish art collections for centuries, first in the royal collection, and then in the Prado\u2019s collection starting in 1819, when the museum opened, the Prado statement said. At a packed news conference at the museum, Prado officials said the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d copy underwent a big change in the 18th century, when someone ordered the colorful background landscape to be painted over in black. Art historians know that some other paintings underwent similar transformations, with backgrounds being obscured.   \u2018Mona Lisa\u2019 model to be revealed by crypt? In the case of the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d copy, the painted-over version left just the young woman in view, with none of the tell-tale background that could link it more closely to the masterpiece. This portrait was actually on display for years at the Prado, without anyone realizing what was hidden, museum officials said. Two years ago, the Louvre asked the Prado to study this portrait with the aim of getting it on loan for the Leonardo exhibit to start late next month, Prado officials said. The Prado restoration workshop began a series of painstaking tests on the copy, including chemical analysis and infrared imaging, which suggested the black paint was covering up some earlier part of the painting. The painting was cleaned of oxidized varnish and then very small portions of the black were removed at the edges, and those sections were compared to the original masterpiece in the Louvre. As positive matches occurred \u2013 sections of landscape in the original matching newly uncovered sections of landscape in the copy \u2013 more of the black was removed, until it was finally revealed to be a contemporary copy. Prado officials said much more study will now be done on the copy, including trying to figure out exactly who painted it. There are few likely candidates \u2013 people who were working in Da Vinci\u2019s workshop at the time \u2013 but art experts are not yet sure which one might be the artist. The copy will go to the Louvre as part of the \u201cLeonardo\u2019s Final Masterpiece\u201d exhibition, which focuses on his work, \u201cThe Virgin and Child with St. Anne.\u201d Unveiling of alternate \u2018Mona Lisa\u2019 raises questions"

He\u2019s not talking about overcoming a problem with drugs, gambling or alcohol, nor is the American going through a personal or professional crisis.  No, the 25-year-old, who won his first major title in 2011, has a big issue building up in the back of his throat.   \u201cI\u2019d like to apologize for my spitting,\u201d the PGA Championship winner wrote on micro-blogging site Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s like a reflex; I don\u2019t even know I\u2019m doing it.\u201d In some cultures, expectoration is not uncommon. But on the golf course, it\u2019s a massive no-no and such behavior often sparks outrage.  Tiger Woods was fined for a similar transgression in a European Tour event in 2011, and golf coach and broadcaster Denis Pugh took exception to Bradley\u2019s repeated hocking during last weekend\u2019s Northern Trust Open. Winner Haas skips friend\u2019s wedding for fourth Tour triumph The tension seemed to get to the 25-year-old, who spat repeatedly during his pre-shot routine while engaged in a three-man playoff eventually won by Bill Haas. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s a cultural thing, OK to spit in USA? If so how did you let that happen America?\u201d Pugh wrote on Twitter. \u201cIn USA where&when is spitting not appropriate?Church? Dinner table? Ladies present? Full view of hd tv camera? There must be a time not 2do?\u201d Pugh orchestrated a campaign directed at one of Bradley\u2019s sponsors, equipment maker Cleveland Golf, who at first defended their player. \u201cWe support Keegan whether he spits or not!\u201d the company countered, before explaining that the player chews sunflower seeds \u201cand they have to go somewhere.\u201d Then they got light-hearted about it: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the licensing agreement for his saliva!\u201d However, the public pressure told as Cleveland subsequently issued a statement on Facebook admitting that maybe Bradley had some improvements to make. \u201cWe proudly stand by Keegan, as we have since he was on the Hooters Tour,\u201d the world No. 19\u2019s sponsor said.  \u201cWe know that he has a few quirks during his pre-shot routine, just like a lot of us, and he\u2019s working very hard to overcome the spitting. We look forward to seeing Keegan in a Cleveland visor for many years to come.\u201d Pugh, who once coached former European No. 1 Colin Montgomerie, accepted the apologies and called Bradley \u201cclassy\u201d for admitting his behavior was wrong.  \u201cHe\u2019s actually a good man, his coach & I are good pals,\u201d wrote Pugh, who now works with European Ryder Cup players Edoardo and Francesco Molinari of Italy. After watching the conclusion to Sunday\u2019s tournament, Pugh tweeted: \u201cPro golf has some serious issues at moment and PGA Tour is turning a blind eye.\u201d \u201c(PGA Tour commissioner) Tim Fincham must do something about slow play and spitting.\u201d But his was not a view shared by all golf lovers. Cleveland\u2019s Facebook post also attracted a host of comments supporting Bradley, with one saying: \u201cSpitting is not a big deal. His pre-shot routine is quite quirky, but it works for him. He\u2019s won on Tour and will continue to win for quite some time.\u201d Other users agreed. \u201cDon\u2019t fix what\u2019s not broken, it works,\u201d read one comment, while another said, \u201cHe\u2019s a heck of a young player and conducts himself with grace.\u201d Woods, arguably still golf\u2019s biggest star despite his fall from grace in the past two years, fell foul of the sport\u2019s disfavor for phlegm in February 2011 during a frustrating final day at the Dubai Desert Classic. The 14-time major champion was fined for a breach of conduct after being spotted spitting on the 12th green.  \u201cThe Euro Tour is right,\u201d said Woods, who also used Twitter to express his regret 12 months ago. \u201cIt was inconsiderate to spit like that and I know better.

It\u2019s the richest part of Chelsea\u2019s history, full of trophies and success, and you want to perpetuate that into the future.  \u201cTo do that, you have to sometimes make changes because you cannot sustain the same habits that you had in 2004, when this environment and team was created to make a winning side.\u201d He continued: \u201cThese words would be more valuable coming from the top.

If I win, fantastic. If I lose, well, I\u2019ve lost to one of the best players in golf\u2019s history.\u201d Holder Luke Donald opens his defense against veteran South African Ernie Els, with Peter Hanson of Sweden or American Jason Dufner awaiting the winners. However, the Englishman has an outside chance of losing his world number one ranking to either compatriot Lee Westwood or Northern Ireland\u2019s Rory McIlroy \u2013 should one of those two players win the tournament. Westwood will open his tournament against Belgian Nicolas Colsaerts, with the winner facing either Robert Karlsson or Fredrik Jacobson, both of Sweden. McIlroy\u2019s opening match is against South African George Coetzee, with Anders Hansen of Denmark or Korean Kyung-tae Kim awaiting the victor of that duel."

        "content": "Bill Haas should have spent Sunday celebrating a friend\u2019s wedding. Instead he was toasting a fourth PGA Tour title after beating major champions Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley in a playoff to clinch the Northern Trust Open. Haas, the 2011 FedEx Cup series victor, looked to have won the California tournament outright after shooting two-under-par 69 in his final round.  But the new world No. 12 was pegged back after Mickelson, who was looking to secure back-to-back tour wins, and 2011 PGA Championship winner Bradley both birdied the par-four 18th to join him on seven under. Haas eventually sealed victory with a 45-foot putt on the second additional hole, having earlier overhauled a two-stroke deficit on third-round leaders Mickelson and Bradley. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll talk to him later and hopefully his day is even better than mine,\u201d the 29-year-old Haas told the PGA Tour\u2019s official website when asked about missing friend Jon Hopson\u2019s big day. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sweet for both of us today. \u201cI never expected to make a 40-footer, especially in that situation. A little luck was involved. I guess it was meant to be.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just Haas who was surprised to see his effort find the cup, with both Mickelson and Bradley expecting him to come up short. \u201cBill hit a tremendous putt,\u201d the 41-year-old Mickelson said. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking it\u2019s a very difficult three. It\u2019s a defensive hole. You\u2019re just trying to make four, believe it or not.\u201d The 25-year-old Bradley added: \u201cI didn\u2019t think he was going to make that one. I should have known, though, because he\u2019s a great putter and a great player.\u201d The victory means has Haas won a PGA Tour title three years in a row, and moved him up to fifth in the early-season FedEx Cup standings. Haas was battling a partisan crowd at the Riviera Country Club, with onlookers lending their backing to California native Mickelson \u2013 a two-time winner of the event who was on a roll after clinching the AT&T National Pro-Am seven days before. \u201cHonestly \u2018Phil\u2019 sounds really similar to \u2018Bill,\u2019 so you just kind of pretend that maybe they\u2019re for you,\u201d said Haas. \u201cIf I\u2019m at home, I\u2019m cheering for Phil.\u201d Former world No. 2 Sergio Garcia carded a stunning 64 to finish tied for fourth on five under, level with 10th-ranked Dustin Johnson (71), his fellow American Jimmy Walker (69) and New Zealand\u2019s Jarrod Lyle (70). American trio Bo van Pelt (70), J.B. Holmes (70) \u2013 who is back this year after brain surgery \u2013 and Jonathan Byrd (73) were tied for eighth on four under. Australian world No. 8 Adam Scott (70) was part of a seven-way tie for 17th which also included 2007 Masters champion Zach Johnson (72) and last month\u2019s Farmers Insurance Open winner Brandt Snedeker (70). British world No. 1 Luke Donald endured a torrid final round and carded eight bogeys on his way to a 78 which saw him finish seven over. "

The Argentina striker took his tally for the league season to 27, one behind Real\u2019s Cristiano Ronaldo, and has scored 44 in all competitions for the Spanish and European champions this campaign. Barcelona\u2019s win closed the gap on Real Madrid to 10 points, though Jose Mourinho\u2019s side are still the overwhelming favorites to clinch the title with two and a half months of the season remaining. \u201cWe\u2019re so lucky to be living in a time when these players play. This team dignifies the sport,\u201d coach Pep Guardiola said of his team\u2019s performance.  \u201cIt\u2019s a shame we\u2019re so far away. I sincerely believe that our play isn\u2019t representative of being 10 points down, but we are, and we have to live with it. The distance is what it is, let\u2019s see if we can fulfill our job.\u201d   Messi celebrated his 200th La Liga game for Barca with his 15th hat-trick for the Catalan club, and the 24-year-old has now notched 146 goals.  \u201cIt\u2019s important that the team has found its form again, like we did in Germany (last week in the Champions League). We have to keep on playing like this, important games are coming up,\u201d Messi said. He hopes that Guardiola will renew his one-year contract and stay at the Nou Camp for a fifth season as coach. \u201cThe manager knows what we think, but he will make his decision at the appropriate time. Obviously, we all want him to stay at Barca because, to us, he\u2019s very important.\u201d Third-placed Valencia opened the scoring at Camp Nou with Pablo Piatti\u2019s ninth-minute strike, but a two-goal burst from Messi put Barcelona ahead after 26 minutes. Messi then pounced on a loose ball in the area to claim his hat-trick before a cheeky, scooped finish when clean through on goal made it four \u2013 the second time he has done so for Barca.  Spain midfielder Xavi put the seal on an emphatic victory in stoppage time. Benzema brace helps Madrid stretch lead Elsewhere, Athletic Bilbao moved into fourth after a 3-1 win over Malaga as Fernando Amorebieta, Mikel San Jose and Gaizka Toquero scored the goals. Atletico Madrid stayed sixth with a 1-1 draw away at Sporting Gijon, as Sebastian Eguren equalized for the home side after Roberto Canella\u2019s own goal. Granada moved away from the drop zone after beating Real Sociedad 4-1, both teams having a man sent off, while Mallorca thumped Villarreal 4-0 with Victor Casadesus grabbing two goals. Rayo Vallecano moved up to eighth with a 5-3 win at Levante, Diego Da Silva Costa and Lass scoring two goals each. In Italy, AC Milan usurped Juventus at the top of the table with a 3-1 win at Cesena. Sulley Muntari, Urby Emanuelson and Brazilian forward Robinho were on target as Milan went a point clear. Udinese moved into third place on goal difference despite a 0-0 draw at home to Cagliari, due to Lazio\u2019s 5-1 defeat at Palermo. A Fabio Borini goal was enough to see AS Roma past Parma and into fifth place. Novara climbed off the foot of the table after a 0-0 draw at home to Atalanta, while Lecce thumped Siena 4-1 despite going a goal behind. Cyril Thereau scored the winner as Chievo won away at Genoa. In Germany, Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored twice as Schalke beat VfL Wolfsburg 4-1 as they closed within one point of third-placed Bayern Munich. In Sunday\u2019s other match, Hannover moved level on points with sixth-placed Bayer Leverkusen after a 4-2 victory over VfB Stuttgart."

The publication date was announced to staff of the embattled newspaper Saturday night by News International Chief Executive Tom Mockridge, according to The Sun. News International is a U.K. subsidiary of Murdoch\u2019s huge News Corp. empire, which has been rattled by a phone-hacking scandal.  \u201cThis is our moment. I am sure every one of us will seize the opportunity to pull together and deliver a great new dawn for The Sun this Sunday,\u201d the newspaper quoted Mockridge as saying. Murdoch announced during a newsroom visit Friday that that paper would move \u201cvery soon\u201d to a seven-day publication schedule. The Sun on Sunday replaces the News of the World, a sister paper to The Sun that was shuttered in July amid the scandal. Police in London are investigating the hacking claims as well as suspected corruption involving public officials. As part of their investigation, officers on February 11 arrested five senior journalists at The Sun over allegations of improper payments to police and officials. A police officer, an employee of the Ministry of Defence and a member of the armed forces were also detained. The arrests followed those of four current and former Sun employees two weeks earlier in connection with the same investigation. Murdoch traveled to London on Friday to visit The Sun staff. His announcement of a Sunday edition appeared to be a bid to boost morale at the paper, where staff have reacted angrily to the arrests and journalistic investigations of their journalistic practices, likening them to a witch-hunt.  Editor Dominic Mohan has said the paper has a readership of more than 7.7 million.  \u201cThis is a truly historic moment in newspaper publishing and I am proud to be part of it. The Sun\u2019s future can now be reshaped as a unique seven-day proposition in both print and digital,\u201d Mohan said of the new Sunday edition, according to the paper."

The 16-time grand slam winner made light work of his clash against the Argentinian third seed, winning 6-1 6-4 in just one hour and 26 minutes. Federer\u2019s triumph was his 71st career title and means 2012 becomes the 12th straight year in which he has captured an ATP tour crown. The Swiss, who also won here in 2005, said in a courtside interview: \u201cIt\u2019s incredible that it took me seven years to come back and defend my title, I hope the next time is not so long. But if it is, then it means I\u2019ll be  playing for another seven years.\u201d \u201cThis title marks a great start to the season. My team made a lot of sacrifices. It\u2019s been an amazing week for us.\u201d Of his opponent, who beat him in the 2009 U.S. Open final, Federer said: \u201cJuan Martin had a great week. He\u2019s playing great tennis. I hope to see you at the (November) World Tour Finals.\u201d Federer, who took his record to 9-2 over Del Potro, blew his opponent away in the opening set, racing into a 5-0 lead after only 28 minutes and securing the opener 6-1 shortly after. Del Potro rallied in the second set, and forced Federer to save a clutch of break points, but the 30-year-old secured the decisive break in the fifth game to seal the match. It marks a return to form for Federer who came into the tournament on the back of two defeats \u2013 to Rafael Nadal in the semifinals of the Australian Open and American John Isner in the Davis Cup.

Suarez grabbed the final goal in Liverpool\u2019s rout of second tier Brighton, in his third game back after serving an eight-match ban for aiming a racial slur at Manchester United\u2019s Patrice Evra, but only after he had missed a penalty that he was urged to take by manager Kenny Dalglish. With Liverpool 5-1 up, the Scot insisted Suarez step up to take the penalty but his effort from 12 yards was saved by Brighton keeper Peter Brezovan. Dalglish later admitted to ESPN: \u201cThat was a bad decision.  Can Liverpool salvage the Suarez saga? \u201cThere were three of them, Andy Carroll, Charlie Adam and Dirk Kuyt wanted to take it as well and maybe if it hadn\u2019t been five (5-1) one of them  would have done, but I wanted to give him (Suarez) a leg up with his confidence. In the end, he didn\u2019t need my help.\u201d Defender Martin Skrtel put Liverpool ahead early in the game with a header from Steven Gerrard\u2019s corner but a free kick from Kazenga Lua Lua brought Brighton \u2013 ninth in England\u2019s second tier \u2013 level. But Liverpool went in front just before half time when Liam Bridcutt put the ball into his own net. Carroll got his sixth of the season from Stewart Downing\u2019s cross before the hapless Bridcutt diverted a Gerrard cross past Brezovan. Lewis Dunk then scored Brighton\u2019s third own goal,and five minutes after his penalty miss Suarez finished from Carroll\u2019s nod down to make it six. Liverpool will face Stoke in the quarterfinals. Tottenham, third in the English Premier League, were held to a goalless draw by Stevenage, who are 46 places below their opponents in the football league. Louis Saha came closest to breaking the deadlock for the top flight side, but his goal was ruled out as teammate Scott Parker was in an offisde position as the ball crossed the line.  The two will replay the game at White Hart Lane in ten days time and the winner will take on Bolton. Sunday\u2019s early tie saw Premier League Stoke City beat fourth-tier Crawley Town 2-0, despite playing more than 70 minutes with ten men. Rory Delap was sent off for a lunge on David Hunt but a penalty from Jonathan Walters and a header from England striker Peter Crouch saw Stoke through to face Liverpool. The other two ties see Chelsea or Birmingham play Leicester, while Everton will host Sunderland in an all Premier League clash."

Raonic\u2019s booming serve was again impressive throughout the San Jose hard-court tournament as the third seed smashed 61 aces, won 86% of points on his first serve and held 41 of 42 service games. \u201cI won just four points on his serve, which makes it very difficult to win the match,\u201d said unseeded Istomin, who is still searching for his maiden title. \u201cI knew he was a great server and a good player.

Karim Benzema scored twice as Madrid notched up their 18th win in 19 matches since the end of September. The hosts went ahead in the sixth minute as Cristiano Ronaldo headed home from a Kaka cross. Santander made their task even harder when Domingo Cisma was sent off for handling the ball in the 38th minute and soon the deficit was doubled as Benzema scored from a tight angle moments before the break.     Substitute Angel Di Maria netted a third in the 73rd minute before Benzema scored a fourth in the 89th minute.  Barcelona can reduce the arrears to 10 points on Sunday if they beat Valencia at the Nou Camp. Espanyol are up to fourth place after claiming a point in a 1-1 draw with mid-table Getafe.   Substitute Alvaro Vazquez gave Espanyol the lead in the 66th minute only to relinquish it a minute later when the referee awarded Getafe a penalty after Miku was brought down by Thievy Bifouma. Miku made no mistake from the spot.    Meanwhile in Serie A, Juventus came from behind to beat 10-man Catania 3-1 in Turin. Pablo Barrientos gave the Sicilians the lead in the 4th minute before Andrea Pirlo put Juve back on level terms in the 22nd minute. Marco Motta\u2019s dismissal in the 65th minute saw Juve take control of the match with goals from Giorgio Chiellini  in the 74th minute and Fabio Quagliarella seven minutes later wrapping up the three points.  The win means Juventus now lead by two points but AC Milan can return to the top if they win at Cesena on Sunday. "

        "content": "A second-half strike by Kevin Grosskreutz earned Borussia Dortmund a 1-0 win at relegation-threatened Hertha Berlin on Saturday to extend their lead at the top of the Bundesliga. The German midfielder\u2019s acrobatic overhead kick in the 66th minute proved enough to extend the reigning champions\u2019 lead to three points after Bayern Munich could only draw 0-0 away to bottom-of-the-table Freiburg.   Hertha remain in 15th place with 20 points but will hope new coach Otto Rehhagel, who led Greece to victory in the European Championships back in 2004, can turn their season around when he takes over on Sunday succeeding Michael Skibbe who was sacked last weekend.  With Bayern dropping points, Borussia Moenchengladbach move up to second place in the table with a 2-1 win at  Kaiserslautern. Midfielder Patrick Herrmann opened the scoring in the ninth minute before a shoulder injury forced him off later in the game.  Venezuelan Juan Arango doubled the lead five minutes later.  Danish defender Leon Jessen pulled one back for the home side in the 63rd minute but a much needed equalizer never materialized leaving Kaiserslautern languishing in 16th place with 20 points.  Werder Bremen triumphed in the north German derby beating Hamburg 3-1 at the Imtech Arena. The visitors went ahead in the ninth minute thanks to a goal from Marko Marin with 18-year-old midfielder Tom Trybull scoring his first league goal on the stroke of halftime to make it 2-0.  With 14 minutes remaining Hamburg pulled one back when Mladen Petric scored from a free-kick but Austrian striker Marko Arnautovic made sure of three points for Bremen four minutes from the end. Bayer Leverkusen stay in sixth place after a 4-1 win over second-from-bottom Augsburg, while Nuremberg are up to 12th thanks to a 2-1 win over Cologne. Schalke take on Wolfsburg on Sunday while Hanover host Stuttgart. Meanwhile in England, Arsenal suffered a miserable end to a desperate week as Sunderland beat them 2-0 at the Stadium of Light in the fifth round of the FA Cup. A 40th minute strike by Kieran Richardson and an own-goal from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 12 minutes from the end rubbed salt in the wounds of a 4-0 defeat to AC Milan in the Champions League on Wednesday. Robinho brace helps Milan thrash Arsenal Over in West London things show no sign of improving for Chelsea as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Championship-side Birmingham City at Stamford Bridge. Under-pressure manager Andre Villas-Boas saw his side concede a goal and miss a penalty (Juan Mata\u2019s shot being pushed onto the post by keeper Colin Doyle) in the first half. Daniel Sturridge\u2019s 62nd minute strike spared the Blues\u2019 blushes but it wasn\u2019t enough to placate the home fans who booed their players off the pitch at the end of the match.  Chelsea travel to Napoli on Tuesday to play the first leg of the last-16 Champions League tie.   Fellow Premiership team Everton fared better though, beating Blackpool 2-0 at Goodison Park and Bolton Wanderers enjoyed the same margin of victory away to Millwall.  But Norwich City went down 2-1 to Leicester City at Carrow Road. "

Australian Chris Eaton recently launched a renewed drive on behalf of FIFA to battle the multi-billion dollar trade in illegal betting, driven by organized crime groups. But on Friday FIFA announced Eaton would be leaving in May to become director of sport integrity for the Qatar-based International Center for Sport Security. Eaton told CNN World Sport that it was imperative governments work together to tackle the growing trend of illegal betting syndicates altering the outcomes of football matches across the globe. He said although he was leaving, FIFA\u2019s commitment to the issue would not be diluted. \u201cThe fight (against match fixing) will not stop. It won\u2019t stop in football, it won\u2019t stop generally. \u201cMy job in this new sphere is bigger and covers more sports than football but the fight in football will continue without doubt.\u201d Eaton, who worked for international policing organization Interpol before joining FIFA, said the campaign against match fixing was at a critical stage. He added: \u201cThe main challenge is to somehow break this nexus between organized crime and international gambling that is illegal. \u201cThe South East Asian international gambling we\u2019ve discussed before is of enormous quantity and gives a great temptation to trans-national organized crime and established criminal organizations. \u201cThis has to be attacked by governments and by a concerted and collective effort of all law enforcement around the world.\u201d Eaton said his new role at ICSS would help provide support to numerous governments, sporting bodies and even bookmakers. The Australian said FIFA were currently searching for someone to replace him and that president Sepp Blatter would keep the illegal gambling issue at the top of his agenda. \u201cI believe that FIFA has a few troubles at the moment, we all know that, but I\u2019m certain they\u2019ll come back to the front foot on this and that president Blatter will be charging down the line and pushing his anti match fixing message,\u201d he said."

        "content": "Pope Benedict appointed 22 new cardinals at the Vatican on Saturday, with his choices for the lofty role likely to influence who will be appointed as the next pontiff. The Vatican named the new cardinals last month, but they were officially inducted by the pontiff in a special ceremony at St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. Among those to be elevated to the College of Cardinals are New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan, cementing his standing as the top Catholic in the United States, and Archbishop Edwin F. O\u2019Brien of Baltimore. Others include Archbishop Thomas Collins, from Toronto, as well as the Bishop of Hong Kong, John Tong Hon, and Major Archbishop George Alencherry from India Senior clerics from Germany, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Romania and Brazil are also represented, as well as several from Italy. The College of Cardinals was established in 1150. Its main role is to advise the current Pope and pick his successor. \u201cThis is the most exclusive club in the Catholic Church,\u201d said John Allen, CNN\u2019s Vatican analyst. \u201cIn many cases, you also become, at least informally, a candidate to be the next pope, because the next pope will almost certainly come from the roughly 120 cardinals under the age of 80.\u201d  Once a cardinal reaches 80, he is no longer able to participate in the election of the pope or enter the secret conclave where cardinals gather when the time comes to select the next pope, typically upon the prior pope\u2019s death. The new cardinals each professed their faith and swore an oath of obedience to Pope Benedict and his successors during Saturday\u2019s ceremony, called the Consistory, at the Vatican. They then walked one by one to the pontiff and knelt in front of him to receive the traditional red hat, or \u201cbiretta,\u201d and gold ring, and a document with the name of the cardinal\u2019s titular church in Rome. In his address, Benedict said that in joining the College of Cardinals, the clerics would \u201cbe united with new and stronger bonds not only to the Roman Pontiff but also to the entire community of the faithful spread throughout the world.\u201d Emphasizing the importance of service over self-interest, the pontiff said the red of the cardinals\u2019 hats was symbolic of the ultimate sacrifice they would make if required. \u201cThe new cardinals are entrusted with the service of love: love for God, love for his Church, an absolute and unconditional love for his brothers and sisters, even unto shedding their blood, if necessary, as expressed in the words of placing the biretta and as indicated by the color of their robes,\u201d he said. Pope Benedict also announced seven new saints, including the first Native American saint, a 17th-Century Mohawk woman called Kateri, or Catherine, Tekakwitha, who was a Catholic convert. Existing members of the College of Cardinals and the new cardinals-elect came together for a day of prayer and reflection Friday, in preparation for the ceremony, according to the Holy See Press Office. Dolan addressed the gathering on the subject of evangelization, saying there was a need to challenge a growing secularization of society."

The Dutchman had been linked with a return to English club Chelsea, with whom he spent a short stint in 2009 after the sacking of Brazil\u2019s World Cup winning coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. Hiddink led the Netherlands to fourth place in the 1998 World Cup and repeated the feat with underdogs South Korea, as they co-hosted the 2002 World Cup. Four years later he took Australia to their first World Cup in 32 years and reached the quarterfinals. He also won the Intercontinental Cup with Spanish giants Real Madrid in 1998."

        "content": "Manchester City have lodged an official complaint with European football\u2019s governing body after striker Mario Balotelli claimed he was racially abused during Thursday\u2019s match away to Porto. City came from behind to win the first-leg Europa League tie 2-1 in Portugal, but the English Premier League leaders approached UEFA after the match when Italy international Balotelli complained of being subjected to racist chants from fans. UEFA confirmed to CNN Friday that City\u2019s complaint had been received, but said a decision on whether to launch an investigation would not be made until the match delegate\u2019s report had been received. Despite reports that Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Toure, playing his first match since Sunday\u2019s African Cup of Nations final loss to Zambia, was also subject to abuse, a City spokesman said the club only knew of Balotelli\u2019s complaint. Did Liverpool\u2019s U.S. owners act too late? \u201cI didn\u2019t hear this because I was concentrating on the game. I don\u2019t know if (it happened) to Mario and Yaya,\u201d City manager Roberto Mancini was reported to have said by the Press Association. Mancini, who also coached Balotelli when they were both at Inter Milan, praised the 21-year-old for maintaining his focus during the game. Balotelli has had a checkered disciplinary record since arriving in England in 2010 and has just returned from a four-match ban for stamping on Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s Scott Parker during a league match in January. \u201cI think Mario did very well, he played very well,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cHe was calm and it is important he continues like this. \u201cI think this provocation can happen every game. For this reason I spoke with Mario before the game. I said, \u2018Mario think and play, think what you should do during the game.\u2019\u201d Manchester clubs enjoy wins in Europa League Balotelli, an Italian of Ghanaian descent, has been on the receiving end of racist taunts in the past when representing his country. He was repeatedly jeered when he made his second appearance for his Italy in a friendly match against Romania in November 2010. Toure said after the Porto match that one of the reasons why he enjoys playing in England is the lack of racial abuse from fans. \u201cThat\u2019s why we all like the Premier League, because it never happens there,\u201d Toure told Sky Sports. \u201cMaybe in foreign countries they don\u2019t expect black players. \u201cI think in future it will be okay, they will change their minds and the game will become more open. Football is football and the fans come to enjoy the game, and we don\u2019t want things like this to happen.\u201d Despite Toure\u2019s claims, the English game has been hit by several recent race-related incidents. A police investigation was launched last month when a Liverpool fan was alleged to have racially abused third division Oldham\u2019s Tom Adeyemi during an FA Cup tie. Liverpool striker Luis Suarez has also recently returned from an eight-match ban for directing a racial slur at Manchester United\u2019s Patrice Evra. In July, England captain John Terry will face trial for alleged racial abuse of Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand. Manchester City\u2019s Micah Richards and Newcastle\u2019s Sammy Ameobi have received racist abuse on microblogging website Twitter, as have former Everton striker Louis Saha and Scotland-based players Maurice Edu and Kyle Bartley, both of Rangers, and Inverness\u2019 Gregory Tade."

        "content": "A member of the Dutch royal family was severely injured in an avalanche at an Austrian ski resort Friday, local authorities told CNN. Prince Johan Friso, 43, a son of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, was skiing outside the bounds of the ski resort with friends at the resort of Lech am Arlberg when he was hit by an avalanche, a spokesman for the state of Vorarlberg said. No one else in the group was affected, the spokesman said. The prince was under the snow for a \u201cshort period of time,\u201d the spokesman said. He was wearing an electronic beacon that helped rescuers quickly find him, he said. The prince was airlifted to a hospital in Innsbruck, where he is in intensive care, authorities said. Doctors described the prince as stable but not out of danger, according to a statement from the queen. Lech am Arlberg is in Austria\u2019s Vorarlberg state, a popular skiing area in western Austria. The region\u2019s avalanche agency reported there was a considerable to great chance of avalanches in Lech on Friday. It cited new snowfall on top of a packed layer of snow that could cause snow slabs to slide off. The prince gave up his right to the throne when he married in 2004 without Parliament\u2019s permission. He and his wife live in London with their two daughters."

        "content": "A UK government official held \u201cuseful discussions\u201d with authorities in Jordan over efforts to deport a freed radical from Britain to the Arab nation, the Home Office secretary said Friday. The man is Abu Qatada, described by authorities as an inspiration to a September 11 hijacker and other terrorists. Abu Qatada was released from a high security prison on bail Monday, the British Ministry of Justice said. He was already convicted in absentia in Jordan of involvement in terrorist conspiracies after seeking asylum in Britain. While Britain views Qatada as a national security threat, it has been barred from deporting him to Jordan under European law because evidence gained from torture could be used against him. Home Office minister James Brokenshire sat down with Jordanian officials this week and the talks between the countries will continue, Home Office Secretary Theresa May said Friday. \u201cThe UK and Jordan remain committed to ensuring that Abu Qatada must face justice and are pursuing all options with regard to his deportation, and it is my intention to travel back to continue those negotiations shortly,\u201d May said. Aymen Odeh, the Jordanian legislative affairs minister, told CNN this week that Jordan wanted Abu Qatada back on its soil so he could be tried in person on terrorism charges there \u2013 and that he would get a fair trial.  He had been jailed in Britain for six years while the government worked to deport him to Jordan, where he holds citizenship. \u201cEveryone is united in wanting this man deported,\u201d a Home Office spokeswoman said Tuesday. \u201cThis government will exhaust all avenues open to get Qatada on a plane.\u201d \u201cAs we do so, we will continue to negotiate with the Jordanians to see what assurances we can be given about the evidence used against Qatada in their courts.\u201d Odeh said there was no obstacle to Abu Qatada returning to Jordan, and that his trial there would be fair, open to the public and would not rely on any evidence resulting from \u201charmful acts.\u201d  \u201cWhen he comes, will be arrested, and the current charges that were made in absentia will be canceled by law, and will start the trial again,\u201d Odeh said. \u201cHowever, there will be no new investigations in either of the cases. He will have a fair trial, in which he can submit any evidence to defend himself with, in the two cases.\u201d Abu Qatada, who remains under restrictive bail conditions, has denied the allegations against him. Also known as Omar Othman, Abu Qatada arrived in the United Kingdom in 1993 and applied for asylum on the grounds that he had been tortured by Jordanian authorities. He came to the UK on a forged United Arab Emirates passport, according to court documents and claimed asylum for himself, his wife and their three children. The British government recognized him as a refugee and allowed him to stay in the country until 1998. Abu Qatada applied to stay indefinitely, but while his application was pending, a Jordanian court convicted him in absentia on charges related to two 1998 terrorist attacks and a plot to plant bombs to coincide with the millennium. He was released briefly in 2005 after the repeal of the anti-terrorism law on which he was being held. British authorities ordered his renewed detention that year under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, according to the European Court of Human Rights. The British government claims that Abu Qatada is a national security risk who has raised money for terrorist groups, including organizations linked to the former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, and has publicly supported the violent activities of those groups.

        "content": "Four-time major winner Phil Mickelson entered last week\u2019s Pebble Beach tournament without a PGA Tour success since April 2011, but now the American golfer has a chance for his second victory in a week. In a sport where victors struggle to follow one title with another, the veteran left-hander made the perfect start to the Northern Trust Open in California as he claimed the early lead on Thursday. Having carded a stunning final-round 64 to win the AT&T National Pro Am on Sunday, the 41-year-old fired an impressive five-under-par 65 despite difficult conditions at Riviera Country Club. Mickelson handled the blustery winds on the Pacific Palisades course to open up a one-shot lead over Ryder Cup teammate Hunter Mahan and compatriot J.B. Holmes, while several players had yet to complete their opening rounds. The highlight was his approach from nearly 300 yards at the par-five 11th which gave him an eagle chance. The secret to beating Tiger Woods? Ask Butch Mickelson\u2019s attempt finished agonizingly short of the hole, but he was still able to recover and hole a birdie putt. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was going to necessarily be reachable into that wind, but I was able to hit a low drive off the tee that scooted along the ground,\u201d he told the PGA Tour\u2019s website. \u201cI felt like if I could hit one more of those with a driver I could get right up by the green. I felt like it was worth the risk to try to scoop one up.\u201d Mickelson, who won this event in 2008 and 2009, caught a lucky break on the 18th when his chip from behind the green found the cup for a sixth and final birdie of the round. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t one I was really trying to make. It was quick, it was downhill, and I had to play about four or five feet of break, so it\u2019s not one that you\u2019re trying to get aggressive with,\u201d he said.  \u201cI was trying to get good speed and try to let it feed with the break, and I got fortunate, obviously, that it went in.\u201d Holmes, returning to the fold this year after brain surgery, bounced back from the third-round 80 that meant he missed the cut at Pebble Beach. \u201cIt was really difficult. We got about four holes where the wind wasn\u2019t blowing. It was whipping most of the day on us,\u201d he said. American Jonathan Byrd and Sweden\u2019s Carl Petterson were tied for fourth on three under.  South Korea\u2019s K.J. Choi, Spaniard Sergio Garcia and 2009 British Open winner Stewart Cink shot 69s to sit in an eight-way tie for sixth. World No. 1 Luke Donald, his fellow Briton Justin Rose and 2011 U.S. Presidents Cup captain Fred Couples were all on one under after opening rounds of 70. The 2011 PGA Championship winner Keegan Bradley, world No. 10 Dustin Johnson and 2007 Masters champion Zach Johnson were one shot further back. Meanwhile, American golfer John Daly has pulled out of the European Tour\u2019s Avantha Masters in India after injuring his elbow during Thursday\u2019s opening round. The two-time major winner completed a seven-over 79 after hitting a tree root with his second shot at the ninth hole, he confirmed on his Twitter website page. \u201cNo bones are broken, possible torn ligaments according to European Tour Docs \u2013 getting home for X-rays! Back 9 painful to play \u2013 hit a root coming down on #9 & snapped my elbow!\u201d the 45-year-old wrote. Scotland\u2019s Peter Whiteford, ranked 236th in the world, led by two shots at the halfway stage after carding 68 on Friday."

        "content": "Media magnate Rupert Murdoch traveled to London Friday as he seeks to rein in a crisis over alleged misconduct at the embattled Sun newspaper, part of his huge News Corp. empire. Murdoch\u2019s visit follows the Saturday arrests of five Sun journalists as part of an inquiry into alleged illegal payments to British police and officials. In what appeared to be a bid to boost morale, Murdoch told staffers at The Sun \u2013 Britain\u2019s best selling newspaper \u2013 that the company will launch a Sunday edition of the paper. Staff at the paper have reacted angrily to the arrests and internal investigations of their journalistic practices, which they have likened to a witch-hunt. The launch of a Sun on Sunday newspaper to replace the News of the World, a sister paper to The Sun that was shuttered amid a phone-hacking scandal in the summer, had been widely rumored. However, this is the first time News Corp.\u2019s UK subsidiary, News International, has confirmed the move.  In an e-mail to staff at The Sun, Murdoch said the company would \u201cbuild on The Sun\u2019s proud heritage by launching The Sun on Sunday very soon.\u201d He also said he had great respect for the \u201cexceptional journalism\u201d produced by The Sun, but that it must abide by the law. \u201cMy continuing respect makes this situation a source of great pain for me, as I know it is for each of you,\u201d he wrote.  \u201cWe will obey the law. Illegal activities simply cannot and will not be tolerated \u2013 at any of our publications.\u201d In a sign of support for the arrested journalists, none of whom have been charged, Murdoch said all suspensions had been lifted and that they could return to work. News Corp. will cover their legal expenses, he said, adding: \u201cEveryone is innocent until proven guilty.\u201d But he made clear that the newspaper could not protect anyone who had paid public officials. The arrests are part of Operation Elveden, an investigation running in parallel with a police inquiry into alleged phone hacking by the media, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police said. The five journalists, aged 45 to 68, were arrested at their homes in London, Kent and Essex on suspicion of corruption, aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office, and conspiracy in relation to both offenses, police said. Their arrests followed those of four current and former Sun employees two weeks earlier in connection with the same investigation. Allegations of payoffs to public officials by Sun employees threaten to bring the UK crisis across the Atlantic to the United States, where the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prevents companies from paying bribes overseas. \u201cAt the moment it appears he is ready to sacrifice the journalists and journalism in London to do whatever it takes to be seen to be cleaning up his act there so that it will play better in the United States,\u201d Andrew Neil, a former editor of Murdoch paper, The Times, told CNN Thursday. \u201cThe consequence of that is quite amazing \u2013 The Sun, which is the most loyal newspaper Murdoch has ever owned \u2013 now believes it is being hung out to dry and the Sun journalists are turning against them.\u201d Murdoch\u2019s UK interests only represent a $1.6 billion slice of his $32 billion News Corp. empire, which includes movie studio 20th Century Fox, the Fox Broadcasting Co. and Harper Collins Publishers, as well as The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones newswires. \u201cThis is for Rupert Murdoch no longer about journalism. This is about defending News Corp., his American based parent company, from judicial action and investigation in the United States,\u201d Neil said. Such actions could put broadcast operations, the most profitable part of the News Corp. operations, in jeopardy, said Porter Bibb of Mediatech Capital Partners in New York. \u201cIf it can be proven that anybody working for News Corp. bribed or gave money to an official of a foreign government \u2013 i.e. the UK \u2013 that\u2019s a clear violation and the Justice Department will start the wheels in motion, and I think that\u2019s what Rupert Murdoch has been gearing up for in the past few months,\u201d Bibb said.  Following the arrests, Murdoch, chairman and CEO of News Corp, assured an executive he would continue to own and publish The Sun newspaper, according to an internal staff memo sent by News International Chief Executive Tom Mockridge. Mockridge also said he was \u201cvery saddened\u201d by the arrests of deputy editor Geoff Webster, picture editor John Edwards, chief reporter John Kay, chief foreign correspondent Nick Parker and John Sturgis, who is a news editor. Analysis: Murdoch empire - and journalism - on the line News Corp. said in a statement last Saturday that it \u201cremains committed to ensuring that unacceptable news gathering practices by individuals in the past will not be repeated.\u201d News Corp.\u2019s Management and Standards Committee, set up in the wake of the scandal that engulfed the News of the World tabloid, provided the information to police that led to the arrests. The move prompted fury among many reporters at the paper. Trevor Kavanagh, associate editor of The Sun, wrote a column Monday in which he said the paper\u2019s journalists were being subjected to a \u201cwitch-hunt.\u201d \u201cThe Sun is not a \u2018swamp\u2019 that needs draining. Nor are those other great News International titles, The Times and The Sunday Times,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYet in what would at any other time cause uproar in Parliament and among civil liberty and human rights campaigners, its journalists are being treated like members of an organized crime gang.\u201d He said it was right police inquiries are carried out separately from the journalists under investigation.  But he added: \u201cIt is also important our parent company, News Corp, protects its reputation in the United States and the interests of its shareholders. But some of the greatest legends in Fleet Street have been held, at least on the basis of evidence so far revealed, for simply doing their jobs as journalists on behalf of the company.\u201d Murdoch may be hoping his visit to London will lessen the anger felt by staff at The Sun, Britain\u2019s best-selling newspaper. Editor Dominic Mohan has said the paper has a readership of more than 7.7 million. The arrests of the Sun employees comes after Murdoch-owned newspaper News of the World was alleged to have hacked into private voice mails of a wide range of public officials, celebrities and victims of crime.  The phone-hacking scandal prompted Murdoch\u2019s son, News Corp. executive James Murdoch, to shut down News of the World in July. The best-selling British newspaper was 168 years old. So far, News Corp. and its subsidiary companies have paid more than $200 million in legal fees and settlement of 59 of 60 lawsuits filed over phone hacking claims. James Murdoch is facing new e-mail evidence that would have made him aware of widespread phone-hacking at the newspaper. The younger Murdoch has appeared twice before UK. lawmakers and said he had no knowledge of the practice.  "

        "content": "Robbers broke into a museum in Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympics, tied and gagged a museum guard, and fled with stolen artifacts, Greek authorities said Friday. The two men raided the Museum of the History of the Olympic Games, a smaller building close to the main Archaeological Museum of Olympia, just after 7:30 a.m. local time, said Athanassios Kokkalakis, a police spokesman.  The robbers \u201capproached the museum\u2019s guard, tied her hands and bound her mouth and then went into the museum, where they took 65 to 68 small clay and brass small statues, and a gold ring, and put them in a bag and left.\u201d Culture Minister Pavlos Geroulanos submitted his resignation after the robbery took place, the prime minister\u2019s office said. Geroulanos\u2019 office said his offer to step down not yet been accepted. The minister is on his way to Olympia to view the scene of the robbery. It is the second big theft of this kind this year in Greece.  In January three art works, including a painting by Pablo Picasso and another by Piet Mondrian, were stolen from the National Gallery in Athens.  Dimitra Koutsoumba, president of the Greek Archaeologists\u2019 Association, said the latest attack was a sad and worrying incident. \u201cIt is the first time that we have an armed robbery at a museum during operating hours. It shows that the cuts the Culture Ministry has made since the crisis hit in 2009 make it easier for such incidents to take place,\u201d she said. \u201cThe minister himself had told us that the cuts were ranging between 30% and 35%, and they include cuts in personnel.\u201d She called for more importance to be placed on cultural heritage and said greater steps should be taken to protect irreplaceable items that belong to the nation.  \u201cSuch incidents are an issue of national security,\u201d she said.  \u201cThe artifacts that were taken were mainly figurines related to the Olympics, so many were depicting athletes.\u201d  The museum, built on an ancient site in the Peloponnese peninsula, is considered among the most important in Greece. The ceremony for the lighting of the Olympic flame for the 2012 London Olympics is scheduled to take place on May 10 at the Ancient Olympia site, where the museum is located. The first Olympic Games were held in Olympia in 776 B.C. to celebrate the deity Zeus. A sanctuary at the site was dedicated to him."

        "content": "Germany\u2019s President Christian Wulff announced his resignation Friday following a series of scandals that prompted calls for him to step down. The German presidency is a largely ceremonial office, but Wulff\u2019s resignation is seen as a blow to Chancellor Angela Merkel, who supported his candidacy as president. However, it is unlikely to impact Germany\u2019s handling of the eurozone debt crisis, Carsten Brzeski, a senior economist at ING, told CNN. In a brief televised statement, Merkel said she accepted Wulff\u2019s resignation with the \u201cutmost respect and deepest personal regret.\u201d Wulff had put the interests of the general public to the fore in deciding to resign, Merkel said.  In a separate televised statement, Wulff said Germany \u201cneeds a president who can devote himself completely to national and international challenges\u201d \u2013 and one who commands the trust of a wide majority of citizens. \u201cThe developments of the past days and weeks have shown that this trust and therefore confidence in my ability to serve have been adversely affected,\u201d he said. \u201cFor this reason, it is no longer possible for me to continue in my role as president.\u201d The scandal involves alleged political favors and financial impropriety while he was state premier of Lower Saxony. The Hanover prosecutor\u2019s office called Thursday for the government to waive the president\u2019s immunity from prosecution, in light of the evidence it had gathered. \u201cFollowing extensive analyses of new documents and the evaluation of further media reports, the Hanover Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office now has sufficient factual evidence and therefore grounds for initial suspicion of receiving bribes or being granted advantages,\u201d it said in a statement.  \u201c(The Office) therefore proposes to the president of the German Parliament that immunity for the federal president be waived.\u201d The Hanover prosecutors are investigating David Groenewold, a German film producer, alongside Wulff. At the center of the issue is a story \u2013 first reported on by the German tabloid BILD in mid-December last year  \u2013 that Wulff received a low interest, \u20ac500,000 ($649,000) private loan from the wife of a wealthy friend while still governor of Lower Saxony. This was followed by intense criticism when it emerged that Wulff had attempted to prevent the paper from publishing the story. Trying to put a lid on any negative media coverage, Wulff left an angry message on the answering machine of BILD\u2019s editor-in-chief Kai Diekmann before it reported on the loan. Although Wulff eventually apologized to Diekmann, the former president has always maintained that he did nothing wrong throughout the course of the scandals \u2013 something he reiterated during his resignation speech. \u201cI have always behaved legally correctly in the offices I held,\u201d he said. \u201cI have made mistakes, but I was always honest.\u201d Merkel said Wulff\u2019s presidency would be remembered for his efforts to promote a modern, tolerant Germany. She added: \u201cWith his resignation, President Wulff reiterated his conviction that he always behaved legally correctly in office and in service to the people of our country. I express my utmost respect for this position.\u201d The members of her governing coalition would now discuss who should stand for election in his place, she said, in consultation with other political parties. Merkel had been due to meet Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti in Rome to discuss the eurozone crisis but canceled the trip amid the political storm over Wulff, who belongs to her party. However, Brzeski said that Wulff\u2019s resignation should not have any direct impact on Germany\u2019s handling of the eurozone crisis in the short term, given his almost entirely ceremonial role. \u201cEven if it is the highest official office in Germany, he has no say at all in the government\u2019s policy toward the crisis,\u201d Brzeski said. However, in the medium term the Wulff affair could weaken Merkel\u2019s position in domestic politics, he said, which could affect her ability to win parliamentary votes on the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund, the EFSF, and a second bailout package for Greece. Merkel has not had involvement in any of the scandals. But Wulff\u2019s departure comes within two years of the resignation of his predecessor, Horst Koehler, who was also backed by Merkel \u2013 raises a question mark over her judgment, Brzeski added. Merkel\u2019s decision to liaise with the Social Democrats and the Greens on finding a replacement for Wulff is a break from her earlier stance in 2010, when she insisted on Wulff as successor to Koehler, who resigned following controversial comments in which he suggested military deployments were vital to Germany\u2019s economic success. The chairman of the Social Democrats (SPD), Sigmar Gabriel, said Wulff\u2019s decision had been long overdue. \u201cGermany needs a new beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m assuming that the leaders of the CDU and Federal Chancellor Merkel won\u2019t for the third time be selecting a new candidate with purely partisan motives. They have to include all political parties in their discussions to find a consensus candidate.\u201d The Greens\u2019 parliamentary leaders, Renate K\u00fcnast and J\u00fcrgen Trittin, said they were \u201crelieved that Christian Wulff has finally unburdened the country from agonizing debate with his resignation.\u201d Wulff, who was the state premier of Lower Saxony for seven years, was one of Merkel\u2019s biggest rivals within the Christian Democrats before being elected to the presidency in 2010. It took three rounds of voting in the Bundestag, or German parliament, before he won enough backing from lawmakers to assume the role. German presidents are elected by the Federal Convention, comprised of parliament members. Wulff was born in Osnabruck, Lower Saxony, in June 1959 and went on to become a lawyer, according to the official website of the presidency.  He first entered local politics as a member of the CDU party in 1986 and was elected to Lower Saxony\u2019s parliament in 1994. He was chosen as state premiere by lawmakers in his party following elections in 2003. He was the 10th president to serve in the Federal Republic of Germany. He has been married twice and has two children of his own and a stepson."

        "content": "Rivals Manchester City and Manchester United prospered in the unfamiliar territory of the Europa League as both recorded away victories in the first leg of their last-32 ties. English Premier League leaders Manchester City had to rely on an Alvaro Pereira own goal and a late strike from Argentina striker Sergio Aguero to seal a 2-1 win at Portuguese champions Porto. United, the current English champions, won 2-0 over Ajax in the Netherlands thanks to goals from England winger Ashley Young and Mexico striker Javier Hernandez. Both sides were making their first appearance in Europe\u2019s second tier competition after being knocked out of the European Champions League before the turn of the year. United, two points behind City in the EPL, are now firmly in the driving seat ahead of next week\u2019s second leg at Old Trafford. Manager Alex Ferguson, who has led his side to two Champions League titles during his 25-year tenure at the club, told reporters: \u201cI\u2019m delighted with the scoreline. Can Liverpool salvage the Suarez saga? \u201cIt was a very ordinary performance by us. We didn\u2019t reach any great heights in the game but we did improve in the second half and we deserved to win. \u201cIt gives us a good opportunity. We\u2019re not taking anything for granted but at home, at Old Trafford \u2013 we\u2019ve now got a good opportunity to  get through.\u201d Young, playing only his second game after a six-week injury layoff, grabbed the first when he collected Nani\u2019s cross and cut inside his man to drill the ball into the net. And late in the game, a United counter attack saw Hernandez swap passes with England striker Wayne Rooney, before finishing past Ajax goalkeeper Kenneth Vermeer. In Portugal, City went behind in the 26th minute when Varela tapped home Hulk\u2019s cross. But after the break Pereira turned the ball into his own net under pressure from Italian striker Mario Balotelli, before Aguero converted Yaya Toure\u2019s cross late on. Elsewhere, two goals from former Porto striker Falcao handed Spanish club Atletico Madrid a 3-1 win at  Lazio, who are third in Italy\u2019s Serie A. Ex-World Cup ref known as \u2018golden whistle\u2019 jailed for match fixing Atletico\u2019s compatriots Athletic Bilbao didn\u2019t fare so well on the road however, losing 2-1 to Lokomotiv Moscow in the Russian capital \u2013 goals from Dennis Glushakov and Felipe Caicedo canceling out Iker Munain\u2019s opener. A late goal from Filipe Andre Santos rescued a 2-2 draw for Portuguese outfit Sporting Lisbon against Legia Warsaw in Poland. Jakub Wawrzyniak and Janusz Gol scored for Legia either side of Daniel Carrico\u2019s strike. Adam Maher\u2019s goal gave Dutch side AZ Alkmaar a slender advantage to take to Belgium next week after defeating Anderlecht 1-0. Ukrainian club FC Metalist Kharkiv all but sealed a place in the last 16 with a 4-0 win at SV Salzburg in Austria, Jonathan Cristaldo grabbing two goals. A goal from Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar secured a 1-1 draw for German side Schalke against Viktoria Plzen in the Czech Republic. A stunning strike from Turkey international Mehmet Topal handed Spanish club Valencia a 1-0 win at English Premier League side Stoke. Jan Schlaudraff\u2019s penalty completed a comeback victory for Germany\u2019s Hannover 96 over Club Brugge. Maxime Lestienne handed the Belgian side the lead before Artur Sobiech equalised.

But after the Belarusian took her record this year to 14 straight wins on Thursday to reach the quarterfinals of the Qatar Open, she downplayed the pressure she faces to continue that success at the top of the rankings. \u201cIt\u2019s really just a number,\u201d the 22-year-old told reporters.  \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling to have, but I have so many more goals, and I just want to keep working hard and keep improving. I feel there shouldn\u2019t be a limit to how much you can push yourself.\u201d 15-love: Top tennis romances Azarenka\u2019s latest victory was a comfortable 6-3 6-1 success over Romanian Simona Halep, just 24 hours after she had disposed of Mona Barthel. She has barely had time to toast her maiden major victory after beating Russia\u2019s Maria Sharapova in last month\u2019s Australian Open final \u2013 but she did manage to head to Los Angeles for a few days immersed in the world of Hollywood glamor. \u201cI didn\u2019t really get too much time to enjoy the moment. I had to leave (Australia) the next day, and the next day I already had to do a lot of things,\u201d Azarenka said.  \u201cIt was really fun for me to go and watch the men\u2019s final, but it was so hot I couldn\u2019t sit any longer! \u201cI went to LA for a few days. I went to see the Lakers play \u2013 Kobe Bryant is one of my favorite basketball players. That was really, really fun. I also attended the Ellen Show. She\u2019s one of my favorite TV anchors. That was really fun too.\u201d Monfils pulls out as Roddick battles through in San Jose Azarenka is relishing her return to action after being forced to sit out Belarus\u2019 Fed Cup tie against the U.S. \u2013 and a potential meeting with the Williams sisters \u2013 earlier this month due to a back problem. \u201cIf I was looking for more holidays, trust me, I wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d she said.  \u201cI was excited to go out there and finally play again, because it has been a little while \u2013 it seems like it was just yesterday, but it has been over two weeks.

        "content": "He was the soccer referee known as \u201cgolden whistle\u201d who officiated in high-profile events such as the World Cup and the Olympics.  But a Chinese court has called fulltime on Lun Ju\u2019s career by jailing him for match fixing. China\u2019s state news agency Xinhua reported on Thursday that Lu has been sentenced to five and a half years in prison by a court in Liaoning Province after accepting $128,000 to fix seven matches in China\u2019s national league. Three other officials \u2013 Huang Junjie, Wan Daxue and Zhou Weixin \u2013 were also jailed for seven, six, and three and a half years respectively. The cases were brought after a government crackdown on persistent allegations of gambling, match fixing and corruption in China\u2019s football leagues was launched in 2009. But it is the fall of Lu that has grabbed the most headlines around the world. He was the first Chinese official to referee at a World Cup, when South Korea and Japan hosted the showpiece event in 2002. Prior to that he had taken charge of matches at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and was twice voted referee of the year by the Asian Football Confederation.  But the court in the city of Dandong, near the border with North Korea, found that Lu had altered the outcome of seven games that involved four clubs including Shanghai Shenhua, who have just signed former France striker Nicolas Anelka from English club Chelsea. Huang was convicted of accepting $247,975 from seven separate cases while $31,760 of his personal assets were also confiscated. Zhou was proved to have taken $77,829 to fix eight games. In 2004 he awarded a penalty in a Chinese Super League match that prompted seven clubs to protest against the Chinese Football Association. Zhou and Huang were also found to have fixed the outcome of two international matches, while Wan was convicted of accepting $149,306 to influence games. Former CFA vice-president Yang Yimin and ex-CFA Referee Committee director Zhang Jianqiang are due to be sentenced on February 18, Xinhua reported. The fact that several of China\u2019s top clubs were alluded to in the court cases also casts doubt on the new league season, due to begin in March, as they await to hear if they will be sanctioned."

        "content": "The secret to Phil Mickelson\u2019s recent successes against longtime rival Tiger Woods could lie with the man who has coached both golf superstars \u2013 Butch Harmon. Harmon helped Woods to eight of his 14 major triumphs between 1993 and 2004, and started working with Mickelson three years later. He was on hand to give the veteran left-hander tips during the pair\u2019s final-round showdown at Pebble Beach on Sunday. Mickelson bettered his fellow American for the fifth time in a row when they have played together on the last day of a tournament to clinch his 40th PGA Tour title. Harmon, who has also worked with other top names such as former major champions Greg Norman and Fred Couples, has revealed how he gave Mickelson an insight into what to expect from former world No. 1 Woods. Mickelson roars to victory as Tiger falls apart at Pebble Beach \u201cI explained to Phil some things to be aware of when playing with Tiger,\u201d Harmon told the tour\u2019s official website.  \u201cIf Tiger putts out first the gallery is going to start moving ahead, so if you have a chance to putt out first it\u2019s in your best interest to do so.   \u201cIf it\u2019s close on the back nine, Tiger will sometimes hit three-wood on purpose to make you wait. Tiger\u2019s not doing anything illegal, it\u2019s just a little bit of gamesmanship.\u201d While four-time major winner Mickelson carded a stunning eight-under-par 64 to surge up the leaderboard and win, Woods collapsed from third to tie for 15th after a 75. Tiger seeks \u2018home\u2019 success as he announces PGA Tour triple-header But Mickelson took the time to praise Woods, who is currently enduring the longest winless run of his career having not claimed an official tournament victory since November 2009. \u201cI don\u2019t believe anybody has benefited more from what he\u2019s done for the game than myself,\u201d said Mickelson, who has outscored Woods on eight of the 12 occasions they have played together since he started working with Harmon in 2007. \u201cHe seems to bring out the best in me and the last four or five years. I just seem more focused. \u201c Mickelson also spoke of the \u201clittle bit of inspiration\u201d his wife Amy \u2013 who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009 \u2013 had given him when it looked as if the tournament was slipping away on Friday. A pep talk from her helped him overhaul a six-shot deficit on leader Charlie Wi on Sunday.  \u201cI think it\u2019s a good lesson for me to learn that if you never give up and you stay and you fight hard, you can fight through some bad stretches and still come out on top at the end of the week because you just never know when it\u2019ll turn,\u201d he said, before acknowledging his recent lack of form. The 41-year-old finished 26th at his previous outing in Phoenix, having missed the cut at Torrey Pines and tied for 49th in his season opener at the Humana Challenge in California.  \u201cPrior to the Humana, I had played eight to 10 rounds like Sunday\u2019s final round, and I\u2019ve been wondering where that has been these last three weeks,\u201d he said ahead of Thursday\u2019s opening round at the Northern Trust Open , where he tasted victory in 2008 and 2009. \u201cI was wondering what happened those three weeks because I had been playing well prior, and I\u2019m just glad it finally came out when I needed it the most.\u201d"

        "content": "AC Milan are all but through to the quarterfinals of the Champions League after thrashing Arsenal 4-0 at the San Siro on Wednesday.  Brazilian striker Robinho scored twice as the Serie A champions dominated the first leg of the last-16 tie with the north London club.  Kevin Prince Boateng put Milan ahead in the 15th minute with a sumptuous half-volley after chesting down a chipped pass from Alberto Nocerino.  The Ghana midfielder\u2019s strike flew in off the underside of the bar leaving Wojciech Szczesny with no chance.   Robinho doubled the lead seven minutes before the break heading home a cut-back from Zlatan Ibrahimovic.  Despite the arrival of Thierry Henry in the second half (his last appearance for the Gunners before he returns to the New York Red Bulls) things quickly went from bad to worse. In the 49th minute, Ibrahimovic and Robinho combined again on the edge of Arsenal\u2019s penalty area before a slip by Thomas Vermaelen gifted the Brazilian a free shot which he put past Szczesny with ease. Robine Van Persie forced a fine save from Christian Abbiati in the 65th minute but it was a rare chance for the Dutch striker on a miserable night for Arsene Wenger\u2019s team.  Ibrahimovic completed the rout converting from the penalty spot after he was brought down by Johan Djourou 12 minutes from the end.  \u201cWe were never in the game, we were very poor both offensively and  defensively,\u201d Wenger said, AFP reported. \u201cIt was shocking to see how we were beaten everywhere, it was the worst  performance in Europe by far. There was not one moment during the 90 when we  were really in the game,\u201d he added, AFP reported. The return leg at the Emirates Stadium will be played on March 6. Opinion: Suarez saga harming Liverpool\u2019s global brand In the other Champions League match played Wednesday, Russian champions Zenit St Petersburg came from behind to beat Portugal\u2019s Benfica 3-2 in the first leg of their last-16 tie. Roman Shirokov scored twice while substitute Sergei Semak got the other. Benfica\u2019s goals came from defender Maxi Pereira and Paraguayan striker  Oscar Cardozo, both after errors by goalkeeper Yury Zhevnov. Benfica took the lead in the 20th minute courtesy of a goal from Maxi Pereira before Zenit leveled the scores seven minutes later when Shirokov struck a sweet volley to score his first of the night.  Semak put Zenit in front in the 71st minute before Oscar Cardozo equalized three minutes from the end.  But Zenit responded immediately as Shirokov pounced on a defensive mistake to tap home the winner with two minutes remaining.  \u201cMy players showed really good skill. They showed a lot of heart to win the match in such a grave situation. However they did exactly what we decided to do ahead of the match. We won deservedly tonight,\u201d Zenit manager Luciano Spalletti said, AFP reported. Meanwhile in Serie A, Juventus missed out on the chance to go top after being held to a 0-0 draw at Parma.  Juve\u2019s 10th draw of the league season (and their sixth on the road) means that AC Milan still head the league table but only by one point. The Rossoneri have also played one extra game. The result lifts Parma to 12th place with 28 points.  In Serie A\u2019s other match Wednesday Guido Marilungo scored the winner for Atalanta in a 1-0 win over Genoa.  The strike 12 minutes from the end lifts Atalanta to 13th with 27 points. Genoa remain in 10th  with 30 points."

After winning three out of four grand slam titles in 2011 and clinching the Australian Open in Melbourne last month, Djokovic was given the Order of the Karadjordje\u2019s Star of the 1st degree by Serbian president Boris Tadic.

Berlusconi is charged with bribing a British lawyer, David Mills, to secure favorable testimony in legal cases. Prosecutors requested prison time as they summed up their case against him Wednesday, and the three-judge court is expected to issue a verdict by late February. The former premier\u2019s lawyers have argued that the statute of limitations in the case has expired, and Mills\u2019 conviction in the case was overturned in 2010. And even if convicted, the 75-year-old Berlusconi may never serve time due to appeals and his age \u2013 under Italian law, judges can suspend sentences for convicts over 70.  The 75-year-old Berlusconi dominated Italian politics for a decade and a half before resigning amid a financial crisis in November. He has survived a series of political, corruption and sex scandals over the years, involving allegations of embezzlement, tax fraud and bribery. In addition to the Mills case, he also faces trial on charges that he hired an underage prostitute and later tried to pull strings to get her out of jail when she was arrested for theft.  "

        "content": "Heavy snow in recent weeks has already wreaked havoc across Europe \u2013 now it is damaging some of the continent\u2019s most recognized historic monuments.  The Colosseum in Rome has been forced to shut after small pieces of its walls crumbled away as a result of freezing temperatures.  And buildings in the historic walled town of Urbino \u2013 a UNESCO World Heritage Site \u2013 are reported to be at risk of collapse under the weight of snow, following unprecedented blizzards in the area. Are you there? Share your photos and video with iReport In the Italian capital, thousands of tourists have been disappointed to discover the Colosseum, one of the city\u2019s most popular attractions, is closed to visitors, while checks are carried out to determine the extent of the damage and to help prevent further movement. Rossella Rea, archaeologist and superintendent of the Colosseum, told CNN: \u201cTests and evaluation of the damage is still ongoing, especially on the second level of arches.\u201d Rea said the enforced closure of the site would have a serious financial impact \u2013 the Colosseum attracts some 7,000 visitors a day, paying 12 euros for a ticket \u2013 but that it was necessary in the circumstances. \u201cAt the weekend, some of the tourists didn\u2019t understand why the Colosseum was closed \u2013 for people from northern countries, the snow is not a problem.  \u201cBut it\u2019s very unusual for us and it caused the detachment of dust, concrete and bricks. Little quantities but if they fall from a certain height they can be dangerous.\u201d Cristiano Brughitta, spokesman for Italy\u2019s Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities, said the damage was caused by ice forming on the walls of the monument. \u201cWhen the temperatures drop below zero, and there is rain and snow, it causes ice to form which, with the increase in volume, pushes the external plaster masonry and causes small pieces to fall off,\u201d he said.  David Pickles, senior architect at English Heritage, told CNN such damage was an extreme version of the natural wear and tear buildings face during everyday weather. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole freeze/thaw cycle of damage to buildings where moisture gets into the stonework, into the pores of the stone, it then freezes and expands very significantly, it then breaks up the stone and then when it thaws, bits of stone will start falling off.  \u201cThat\u2019s happening all the time, of course, that\u2019s one of the major decay mechanisms in historic buildings anyway, because they\u2019re largely water permeable\u2026 You can\u2019t treat stone to stop it happening.\u201d In Urbino, in the Marche region of Italy, partial collapses have been reported at the convents of San Francesco and San Bernardino, while the roof of the Church of the Capuchins outside the town center has reportedly caved in.  The town\u2019s Duomo (cathedral) is also shut, because of water damage. Checks are being carried out on vulnerable buildings in the area. \u201cOur biggest worry is the buildings in the historic center, which have wooden joists and delicate roofs,\u201d said Gabriele Cavalera, a spokesperson for the local council.   According to Cavalera, residents of some private homes in the historic center are adding extra support to the old roof beams in an attempt to prevent any further cave-ins.  \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous quantity of snow compared with what we normally get in winter and it\u2019s had a heavy impact, the equivalent of a flood,\u201d said Cavalera.  Brughitta agreed that conditions were exceptional: \u201cMaybe every 30 years it gets this cold, but it\u2019s very rare.\u201d A number of Italy\u2019s historic monuments, including the Colosseum and Pompeii, have suffered in recent years from damage and collapse.  The Colosseum, which is scheduled to reopen to the public Thursday, is due to undergo restoration works later this year with sponsorship from luxury brand Tod\u2019s.  In case of similar snowfalls in the future, Brughitta in Rome suggests using a type of cold-weather \u201cblanket\u201d for exposed monuments such as the nearly 2,000-year-old Colosseum.  Though Pickles said such plans may be difficult, on a practical level: \u201cFor a building like the Colosseum, I should think it would cost a fortune to cover it, because we\u2019re talking about a huge wall area.\u201d And while delicate, these buildings are nonetheless tenacious when it comes to adverse weather and acts of god.  After all, said Cavalera, The Ducal Palace in Urbino, which is around 500 years old and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, managed to resist collapse during the earthquakes of the 1990s and is so far holding out against the snow.

        "content": "French President Nicolas Sarkozy officially announced Wednesday that he is running for re-election. Sarkozy, who heads the center-right UMP party, is currently trailing his chief rival, Socialist candidate Francois Hollande, in opinion polls. Announcing his candidacy via his newly launched Twitter account, Sarkozy said that not running for a second term would be like abandoning his post. He said the reforms undertaken by his government were starting to produce results and that he intended to give the French people back their voice by holding referendums. The first round of voting is scheduled for April 22, with a second round to follow on May 6.  The latest opinion polls suggest Hollande is the favorite in the first round of voting, attracting 30% support to Sarkozy\u2019s 26%, according to polling institute IFOP. Other candidates include Marine Le Pen, of the far-right National Front, and the centrist Francois Bayrou. The news of Sarkozy\u2019s candidacy was expected, but the official announcement means he can now campaign at full tilt for the next 10 weeks. He is likely to play up higher-than-expected gross domestic product growth of 1.7% for 2011, as he seeks to convince the French people that the economy is in safe hands. The unemployment rate is likely to be a big issue on the campaign trail, however, at almost 9.3% of the working population. Sarkozy may also seek to portray himself as someone who has put France at the center of global events during his five-year term in office, using the slogan \u201cA strong France.\u201d Earlier, the French president became the latest high-profile figure to join the social networking site Twitter.   His official account was launched Wednesday morning under the official handle @NicolasSarkozy. \u201cHello everyone, I am very pleased to launch my Twitter account today. Thank you to those who will want to follow me!\u201d his welcome tweet read.  Sarkozy\u2019s second official tweet urged his followers to watch him being interviewed on French television. \u201cI have accepted the invitation by TF1 to appear on their newscast at 8 p.m. this evening, I hope you will join me.\u201d Eleven hours after posting his first message, he had more than 47,000 followers and was following one other Twitter account, his presidential office \u2013 the Elysee Palace.  In a recent interview with national newspaper Le Figaro, Sarkozy laid out what is likely to be the framework of his campaign. He told the newspaper he prioritized work and responsibility, and that he would propose two referendums, so he could hear from the French people on imposing tougher rules on immigrants and unemployment benefits. Asked about his greatest regret in his first term, Sarkozy responded: \u201cWhen I see all that\u2019s left to do and what we have not done\u2026.\u201d Sarkozy was first elected in May 2007."

        "content": "Tiger Woods is looking to the familiarity of home as he continues his search for a first full-field tournament win in over two years. The former world No. 1 has announced he will play three PGA Tour events in the next month, including the Honda Classic in Florida for the first time in his professional career. The tournament is held in Palm Beach Gardens, which is near the 14-time major champion\u2019s home on Jupiter Island \u2013 where he moved last year after his 2010 breakup with ex-wife Elin Nordegren following the scandal about his extramarital affairs. \u201cI\u2019ve heard great things about the Honda Classic,\u201d Woods told his website. \u201cNow that I live there, I want to play whenever possible.\u201d He missed the cut as a 17-year-old amateur in 1993 when the tournament \u2013 which since 2007 has benefited the children\u2019s charity of golf legend Jack Nicklaus \u2013 was played at the Weston Hills course.  \u201cJack\u2019s involvement in the tournament and the benefits to the local community are also important,\u201d Woods said of the March 1-4 event.  Its current venue, the PGA National, is rated as one of the toughest courses on the U.S. circuit. \u201cWe obviously are thrilled to have Tiger Woods play,\u201d tournament director Ken Kennerly told the tour\u2019s website. \u201cWe have worked hard for five years to make this one of the premier events on the PGA Tour.  \u201cThis is a testament to where the tournament has come, and a testament to Honda\u2019s 31 years as the longest-standing sponsor on the PGA Tour.\u201d World No. 18 Woods, who slipped out of the top 50 last year, will also line up at next week\u2019s WGC Accenture Match Play Championship in Arizona next week \u2013 an event he has won three times. After the Honda Classic, Woods will stay in Florida for the WGC Cadillac Championship a week later, where he has tasted victory on a record eight occasions. Woods will be in illustrious company at Doral, with world No. 1 Luke Donald and 2011 U.S. Open winner Rory McIlroy both confirming their attendance on Tuesday. The American has shown signs of returning to form in recent times, finishing tied for third at the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship last month and winning the Chevron World Challenge event he hosts in December. \u201cI\u2019m excited about my start and look forward to keep building,\u201d said the 36-year-old, whose last tour-sanctioned win was in Australia in November 2009. \u201cI\u2019ve made great strides from last year and hopefully all my hard work will pay off with a victory soon.\u201d"

        "content": "The apologies issued by Luis Suarez and Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish on Sunday are a sign that the English club\u2019s American owners are finally stepping in to sort out a situation that has festered for too long, says a leading U.S. sports writer. \u201cThis story got attention in the media in the U.S. \u2013 The New York Times, The Boston Globe. These are papers (John Henry, Liverpool\u2019s principal owner) reads,\u201d Sports Illustrated\u2019s Grant Wahl told CNN\u2019s World Sport. The controversy started when Liverpool striker Suarez refused to shake hands with Manchester United\u2019s Patrice Evra before the start of an English Premier League match on Saturday. Suarez, a Uruguay international, was widely criticized for the snub. It came as they met face to face for the first time since he was given an eight-game ban for racial taunts directed at the Frenchman at an earlier fixture between the two clubs in October. United manager Alex Ferguson called Suarez a \u201cdisgrace\u201d while Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre was angered by his own player\u2019s actions. Henry \u2013 co-founder of Fenway Sports Group, which also owns baseball\u2019s Boston Red Sox \u2013 hasn\u2019t said anything publicly yet. However, Wahl said the Sunday apologies were a result of the owners\u2019 intervention. The Merseyside club denied suggestions on Monday that the statements were prompted by the club\u2019s shirt sponsors Standard Chartered. Wahl remains surprised at how Liverpool have handled the affair from the outset.  \u201cWhen we saw the lengthy suspension issued to Luis Suarez, the PR department from Liverpool issued one of the worst PR statements I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Wahl said.  Released in December last year, after the English Football Association handed down its eight-match ban and a \u00a340,000 ($62,000) fine on Suarez, the Merseyside club said it was \u201cvery surprised and disappointed\u201d with the decision.  \u201cI think that gave Luis Suarez the feeling that he was in the right in this situation and that continued up into what we saw last weekend,\u201d Wahl said. He believes Liverpool should have just accepted the penalty and moved on.  \u201cI\u2019m surprised that the ownership group of Liverpool, which is well-versed in American sports, let this go on this long,\u201d Wahl said. \u201cMy feeling is that maybe that\u2019s connected to the relationship between the previous American owners at Liverpool and the fans and club, and maybe not wanting to be seen as meddling,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they should have meddled along time ago and start putting things in the right direction. This took far too long to happen.\u201d Henry is scheduled to attend the final of the English League Cup when Liverpool take on second division Cardiff at Wembley Stadium on February 26, but some media reports have speculated that he will perhaps fly over earlier.  Whether or not this turns out to be true, Wahl said Henry and the ownership group have always made one thing clear.  \u201cLiverpool needs to be making its news on the field by winning and not with this other stuff.\u201d "

        "content": "Barcelona put one foot into the quarterfinals of the Champions League after completing a 3-1 win at Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday.  The reigning European champions dominated possession for large parts of the game with Alexis Sanchez opening the scoring in the 41st minute of the opening leg of the last-16 tie in Germany. The Chilean striker chased onto a pass from Lionel Messi before firing past Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno.  Leverkusen equalized seven minutes after the break as recent signing Vedran Corluka chipped in a cross from which Czech Republic defender Michel Kadlec headed home.  But it wasn\u2019t long before Barca were back in front as Sanchez bagged his second of the night, scoring from a tight angle after receiving the ball from Cesc Fabregas.  Leverkusen had chances to equalize again as Renato Augusto forced a save from Victor Valdes, and midfielder Gonzalo Castro also hit the post in the 64th minute.  But it was Messi who had the final say on the evening, converting a cross from Dani Alves in the 88th minute to give Barca a comfortable buffer ahead of the second leg at the Nou Camp on March 7.  The world player of the year had started the move, finding Alves down the right with a superb pass, and he earlier hit the post after a sublime flick over the onrushing Leno. In Tuesday\u2019s other last-16 tie, French side Lyon scored a narrow 1-0 win over minnows APOEL FC at the Stade Gerland.  Alexandre Lacazette\u2019s goal in the 58th minute proved the difference between the teams, but the first club from Cyprus to reach the knockout stages still have hopes of progressing with victory in Nicosia on March 7. There were two Europa League ties played Tuesday with Besiktas beating 10-man Braga 2-0 in the first leg of their last-32 tie. Helder Barbosa\u2019s dismissal in the first half capped a miserable night for last year\u2019s finalists as their Turkish visitors made the most of the numerical advantage with goals in either half from Tomas Sivok and former Portugal international Simao.  Olympiakos edged Russian side Rubin Kazan 1-0 thanks to a goal from David Fuster in the 73rd minute. Former Manchester United goalkeeper Roy Carroll coming on as a substitute to save a penalty five minutes later to earn the Greek side a hard fought victory. "

        "content": "Prosecutors in Italy lodged an appeal Tuesday of the acquittal of American student Amanda Knox in the murder of British student Meredith Kercher. Knox and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were convicted of murder in the town of Perugia in 2009 but were cleared when they appealed the verdicts in October. The case gripped the attention of the public in the United States, Italy and Britain. Knox\u2019s family said in a statement issued through a spokesman that the appeal was unwelcome, but no cause for concern. \u201cThe appeal of Amanda\u2019s acquittal by the prosecution was not unexpected as they had indicated from the day of the verdict that they would appeal,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are not concerned about this appeal as Amanda\u2019s innocence was clearly and convincingly proven in her appeal trial. This is simply another example of harassment by the prosecution against Amanda and makes this terrible, painful incident continue to go on for Amanda, Raffaele and their families.\u201d Giovanni Galati, a Perugia prosecutor, had earlier told reporters the acquittal should be overturned because Knox and Sollecito were guilty, according to Italian news agency ANSA. \u201cWe are still convinced that they are the co-authors of Meredith\u2019s homicide,\u201d he is quoted as saying. Knox was 20 and Kercher was 21 when the two shared a home as they studied at the university for foreign students in Perugia, Italy. Kercher\u2019s semi-naked body was found in November 2007 at the home, with her throat slashed. Sollecito, 23 at the time, was Knox\u2019s boyfriend. Francesco Sollecito, father of Raffaele, told CNN in a phone interview Tuesday that the family was \u201cnot happy about the decision. My son is trying to get back to normal life.\u201d \u201cWe can do very little in this situation,\u201d he said, but as Italian citizens they would have to accept the court\u2019s decision. \u201cWe hope that the High Court will finally put the words \u2018The end\u2019 to this story,\u201d he added. Knox\u2019s Italian defense lawyer, Carlo Dalla Vedova, told CNN he had hoped the prosecutors would not appeal. \u201cThis story was too much under the spotlight, and beside (that) there is suffering, there are two young people that unjustly spent nearly four years in prison,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best way of respecting this suffering would have been silence.\u201d Her U.S.-based lawyer, Theodore Simon, said that although the prosecution has appealed, very little has changed in the case. \u201cThe appellate jurors conducted a thorough, painstaking, searching inquiry into the true facts and determined in a lengthy, logical and comprehensive decision that Amanda Knox was not guilty of the tragic loss of Meredith Kercher,\u201d he said. The filing of the appeal has raised the question of whether an arrest warrant or extradition order could be issued for Knox if her acquittal is annulled, or if she could be made to serve the remainder of her initial 26-year prison term. Criminal law professor Nicola Di Mario told CNN that if the High Court was to annul the appeals court ruling that overturned the conviction, the defendants would not automatically go back to jail. However, the prosecutors could, in theory, ask that they be returned to jail if there is a risk that the defendants might escape, or that they could repeat the crime or interfere with the evidence, Di Mario said.  Another Rome law professor, Maurizio Bellacosa, said it is unlikely Knox and Sollecito would be sent back to prison. \u201cAmanda will legitimately remain in the States until a new appeal verdict is issued,\u201d he said.  Di Mario said the High Court would decide on the case in just one hearing, probably in the next six to 10 months. \u201cIt\u2019s a very technical judgment that doesn\u2019t examine the content of the appeal trial. The High Court can only establish if the sentence was or wasn\u2019t logical and coherent,\u201d he said. If the High Court did overturn Knox\u2019s acquittal, it is unclear whether Italy would request her extradition from the United States, or if the United States would grant it. In October, deputy State Department spokesman Mark Toner told CNN that although the United States and Italy have an extradition treaty, he was not able to answer speculative questions on extradition issues. Prosecutor Giuliano Mignini, who took part in previous court proceedings but is not directly involved in the latest case, told CNN that the prosecutors\u2019 appeal was based on 10 points, including questions over apparent contradictions in the ruling. Mignini said the High Court would decide whether to accept or reject the prosecution appeal. It is possible the case would be combined with Knox\u2019s own appeal against her conviction for slander, Mignini added. Knox\u2019s conviction for defaming Patrick Lumumba, a club owner whom she accused of killing Kercher, was upheld in October by the same appeals court that cleared her of murder. She was ordered to pay Lumumba 40,000 euros ($54,000) in damages. The court also sentenced her to three years in prison, but because she had already been held for four years, she was freed immediately. In legal paperwork published in December, the judge in the case wrote that the jury had cleared the pair of murder for lack of evidence proving they were guilty. \u201cEven taken all together,\u201d the prosecution\u2019s evidence does not \u201cprove in any way the guilt of Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito for the crime\u201d of killing Kercher, Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellman wrote. Lawyers for Knox and Sollecito had focused on discrediting DNA evidence that played a role in the 2009 conviction.   Knox returned to her hometown of Seattle with her family following her release. Another man, Ivorian drifter Rudy Guede, was convicted separately of Kercher\u2019s killing. Guede admitted having sexual relations with Kercher but denied killing her."

A group of British peers appealed for the race to be called off in an open letter to The Times newspaper last week, saying that the same problems of social instability prevail as when last year\u2019s event was called off. However, a spokesman for the Bahrain International Circuit (BIC) insisted on Tuesday \u2013 the anniversary of the \u201cDay of Rage\u201d protests against the ruling monarchy \u2013 that the April 22 event will take place. \u201cThe calendar was confirmed for 2012 at the end of last year and Bahrain has a place on that calendar,\u201d the spokesman told CNN under condition of anonymity.

The FIA has been taking the situation seriously for a long time,\u201d he said.  \u201cJean Todt (FIA president) has been visiting Bahrain himself, keeping in constant contact. The FIA has said that there is no reason why the grand prix should not go ahead.\u201d The spokesman said although there had been continuing problems in Bahrain over the past 12 months, the riots in the main city of Manama were smaller than those which took place in Britain\u2019s capital London last August. \u201cWhen I was out there two or three weeks ago it was very quiet \u2026 There is no doubt that there have been some protests,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that there have been some small riots, nothing like on the scale that we saw in London. There have been some public order disturbances, but on the kind of scale that Britain has endured many times.\u201d Bahrain is scheduled to be the fourth race in the 2012 F1 season, which starts on March 18 with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne.

        "content": "A Swiss man sentenced in an Italian court to a 16-year prison term in absentia over deaths of about 2,000 workers who prosecutors said were exposed to asbestos will appeal the ruling, his lawyer said Tuesday. Stephan Schmidheiny, the Swiss owner of the fiber-cement firm Eternit, was sentenced Monday alongside Belgian former executive and investor Jean Louis Marie Ghislain de Cartier de Marchienne. The pair were accused of failing to protect workers in the company\u2019s four Italian factories before they were shuttered in 1986.  Schmidheiny\u2019s lawyer, Astolfo Di Amato, told CNN Tuesday that his client did not accept the sentence handed down by the court in Turin, an industrial hub in northwestern Italy. \u201cThe sentence is certainly a setback, we lost the first battle. (It\u2019s) a defeat that we don\u2019t accept and we will present an appeal,\u201d the lawyer said. He said Schmidheiny had invested large sums in the 1970s in restructuring the plants\u2019 production process and had never set foot in Italy. \u201cThe sentence is dangerous because if in Italy we affirm the principle that the major shareholder of a multinational company is responsible for what happens in each peripheral plant, no one will invest in Italy any longer,\u201d he said. Schmidheiny and De Cartier were also ordered to pay a total of \u20ac80 million ($105 million) to more than 6,000 people, including former workers and residents who lived near their plants.  Bruno Pesce, the leader of Italy\u2019s asbestos victims association, said more than 1,500 people attended Monday\u2019s hearing \u2013 including some who were suffering from asbestos-linked illnesses.  \u201cIt was a very emotional moment,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cPeople were crying because of tension and then of happiness.\u201d Renato Balduzzi, Italy\u2019s health minister, called the sentence \u201chistoric.\u201d  The Italian Eternit company was declared bankrupt in 1986, when the Italian plants were shut down, and the company\u2019s ownership changed in the 1990s. A spokesman for the Swiss Eternit company, Balts Livio, said it was independent from the Italian firm of the same name. \u201cNeither Eternit (Schweiz) AG nor its owner had or have any relationship with Eternit S.p.A., Genoa, and thus with the subject of the criminal proceedings in Turin,\u201d Livio said. Asbestos was once widely used as a fireproofing material and was included in roof shingles and siding for decades. Though now banned in Italy and most Western countries, asbestos is still used in developing countries, mainly in China and India. Exposure to its tiny fibers, particularly over a period of time, can lead to asbestos-related diseases that include lung cancer, asbestosis and mesothelioma, according to the National Institutes for Health."

The long trawl around the globe on both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s tours has often been a breeding ground for blossoming courtships, as lovestruck couples decide it is game, set and match while gazing at the figure on the opposite baseline.

The partnered pair refer to themselves as \u201cWozilroy.\u201d Another golfer, Australia\u2019s Adam Scott, has recently rekindled his romance with glamorous Serbian tennis star Ana Ivanovic, the 2008 French Open champion. Tennis has long been linked with showbiz, and high-profile names in the game have often mingled with stars of stage and screen. British pop crooner Cliff Richard\u2019s relationship with 1976 French Open winner Sue Barker made waves in the early 1980s, while Agassi\u2019s brief marriage to American actress Brooke Shields also attracted a deluge of headlines."

        "content": "A British minister is traveling to Jordan as the United Kingdom seeks a way to deport a freed radical cleric described by authorities as an inspiration to a September 11 hijacker and other terrorists, the Home Office said Tuesday. The British government views Abu Qatada as a national security threat but has been barred from deporting him to Jordan under European law because evidence gained from torture could be used against him. Home Office minister James Brokenshire is heading to Jordan to seek assurances that would allay such concerns. Aymen Odeh, the Jordanian legislative affairs minister, told CNN that Jordan wanted Abu Qatada back on its soil so he could be tried in person on terrorism charges there \u2013 and that he would get a fair trial.  Abu Qatada was already convicted in absentia in Jordan of involvement in terrorist conspiracies after seeking asylum in Britain. Meanwhile, Abu Qatada\u2019s brother, Ibrahim Othman, said the cleric was an educated, affectionate man who needs the right \u201cto live with dignity,\u201d wherever he ends up. Abu Qatada, 51, was released from Long Lartin high security prison on bail Monday, the British Ministry of Justice said. He had been jailed in Britain for six years while the government worked to deport him to Jordan, where he holds citizenship. \u201cEveryone is united in wanting this man deported,\u201d a Home Office spokeswoman said Tuesday. \u201cThis government will exhaust all avenues open to get Qatada on a plane. \u201cAs we do so, we will continue to negotiate with the Jordanians to see what assurances we can be given about the evidence used against Qatada in their courts. James Brokenshire will travel to Jordan shortly.\u201d Odeh said there was no obstacle to Abu Qatada returning to Jordan, and that his trial there would be fair, open to the public and would not rely on any evidence resulting from \u201charmful acts.\u201d  \u201cWhen he comes, will be arrested, and the current charges that were made in absentia will be canceled by law, and will start the trial again,\u201d Odeh said. \u201cHowever, there will be no new investigations in either of the cases. He will have a fair trial, in which he can submit any evidence to defend himself with, in the two cases.\u201d The two cases would be handled by a state security court, which has two military judges and one civil judge, he said.  After the three judges reached a decision, the Supreme Court of Cassation would then review the case on its merits and reconsider the evidence.  The Supreme Court of Cassation is an independent court which regularly revisits verdicts, he said. As for the accusation that Jordan might torture Abu Qatada, Odeh said: \u201cThese are all allegations. After the amendments on the constitution that are effective as of October 2011, it is forbidden to torture or do any harmful act whether it is physical or mental to any prisoner, or even threaten to do so. \u201cAny statement resulting from any harmful acts will not be used in the court at all. Therefore, we can guarantee that he will get a fair trial and it will be open for all to attend.\u201d Odeh said Jordan was concerned that the European Court of Human Rights had failed to consider the changes to its constitution when it ruled that Britain could not deport him there.  Abu Qatada, who remains under restrictive bail conditions, has denied the allegations against him. In a phone interview with CNN Arabic, Othman said that his brother\u2019s relatives in the United Kingdom and Amman were impatiently waiting for his release. He urged Britain to lift the numerous restrictions on Abu Qatada\u2019s movements and contacts with his family, and appealed to whichever country eventually takes him in to \u201cprovide him with guarantees to have a decent living and protection for his life.\u201d Othman rejected media depictions of him as \u201ca dangerous man or a radical terrorist.\u201d He said the release of Abu Qatada on bail was clear evidence of his innocence, saying none of the charges against him had been proved before the British or Jordanian courts. \u201cWe just want him to live a decent life. Abu Qatada is a scholar and a man of knowledge,\u201d he added. On Friday, a UK immigration court said the British government was running out of time to justify Abu Qatada\u2019s continued detention. Justice John Edward Mitting ordered Abu Qatada released from jail under a restrictive set of conditions that requires him to stay in his home 22 hours a day, prohibits him from using computers, phones or other electronic communications, and limits visitors, according to a Home Office spokesman. Mitting gave the government about three months to make progress or face being forced to release Abu Qatada outright. However, a January 17 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights had said that deporting Abu Qatada to Jordan would be a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights because of the likelihood that evidence gained from torture would be used against him. That would violate Abu Qatada\u2019s right to a fair trial, the court ruled. Abu Qatada \u2013 also known as Omar Othman \u2013 arrived in the United Kingdom in 1993 and applied for asylum on the grounds that he had been tortured by Jordanian authorities. He came to the UK on a forged United Arab Emirates passport, according to court documents and claimed asylum for himself, his wife and their three children. The British government recognized him as a refugee and allowed him to stay in the country until 1998. Abu Qatada applied to stay indefinitely, but while his application was pending, a Jordanian court convicted him in absentia on charges related to two 1998 terrorist attacks and a plot to plant bombs to coincide with the millennium. He was released briefly in 2005 after the repeal of the anti-terrorism law on which he was being held. British authorities ordered his renewed detention that year under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, according to the European Court of Human Rights. The British government claims that Abu Qatada is a national security risk who has raised money for terrorist groups, including organizations linked to the former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, and has publicly supported the violent activities of those groups.

        "content": "Moody\u2019s put the UK, France and Austria on negative outlook late on Monday night, raising the prospect that the three countries would lose their triple A ratings due to exposure to the eurozone debt crisis. It is the first time that the heavily indebted UK has been placed on negative credit outlook by a big rating agency since the eurozone crisis erupted. George Osborne, the UK chancellor, said the move supported the government\u2019s tough austerity measures and was \u201ca reality check for anyone who thinks Britain can duck confronting its debts\u201d. But Ed Balls, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, described the decision as a \u201csignificant warning to a chancellor who himself made balancing the books by 2015 and the views of the credit rating agencies the key benchmarks for the success of his economic policy\u201d. He added: \u201cWe have consistently argued that the chancellor\u2019s gamble \u2013 raising taxes and cutting spending too far and too fast \u2013 would backfire because without a balanced plan that promotes jobs and economic growth the government will not succeed in getting the deficit down.\u201d Mr Osborne told the BBC on Tuesday morning however that it was wrong to pretend there was a \u2018false choice\u2019 between growth and reducing national debt. \u201cThe idea that I\u2019m not behind growth is ridiculous\u2026that\u2019s what I spend every day of my life trying to bring about,\u201d he said. Mr Osborne admitted there was no \u2018easy route\u2019 out of the UK\u2019s economic difficulties. A negative outlook means that Moody\u2019s could downgrade the UK in the next 12 to 18 months. The country now shares the same outlook from the rating agency as the US and France. Yves Lemay, managing director for European sovereigns at Moody\u2019s, said: \u201cThe signal is there is pressure on the rating, but we do recognise that the UK\u2019s triple A has some resiliency.\u201d Sterling fell to a two-week low against the dollar, falling to $1.5685, before recouping some of the losses. The yield on 10-year gilts was little changed at 2.13 per cent. French finance minister Fran\u00e7ois Baroin said France\u2019s triple A rating was maintained by Moody\u2019s because of factors including \u201cthe size of its economy\u201d and its \u201cincreased productivity\u201d. He added that the French government was \u201cdetermined to press ahead with its actions to boost growth and competitiveness\u201d. Moody\u2019s said in a statement: \u201cThe primary driver underlying Moody\u2019s decision to change the outlook on the UK\u2019s [triple A] rating to negative is the weaker macroeconomic environment, which will challenge the government\u2019s efforts to place its debt burden on a downward trajectory over the coming years.\u201d It added that the UK was vulnerable to the eurozone and that its outstanding debt placed it among the most heavily indebted of its triple A-rated peers. \u201cAlthough the UK is outside the euro area, the high risk of further shocks, economic, financial, or political within the currency union are exerting negative pressure on the UK\u2019s [triple A] rating given the country\u2019s trade and financial links with the euro area.\u201d The euro and pound both dropped about 0.3 per cent against the dollar in thin early trading in Asia. \u201cMoody\u2019s tends to be more conservative than S&P but it\u2019s trailblazing here by placing the UK on a negative [outlook],\u201d said Kathy Lien, director for currency research at GFT Forex. Moody\u2019s also downgraded a number of eurozone countries including Italy, Spain and Portugal. Italy was cut to A2 from A3, Portugal cut to Ba3 from Ba2, Spain downgraded to A3 from A1. Slovakia, Slovenia and Malta also had their ratings cut with negative outlooks. The move by Moody\u2019s comes after Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded France and Austria, one notch to double A, last month. Moody\u2019s two notch downgrade of Spain places it rating one notch below that of S&P. Mr Lemay of Moody\u2019s said the tough economic outlook facing the eurozone was particularly acute for Spain, with an unemployment rate above 20 per cent and a banking system that is still very much challenged.

        "content": "An Italian court sentenced two officers of a Swiss company to 16-year prison terms in absentia Monday for the deaths of about 2,000 workers who prosecutors said were exposed to asbestos. Stephan Schmidheiny, the Swiss owner of the fiber-cement firm Eternit, and Belgian former executive and investor Jean Louis Marie Ghislain de Cartier de Marchienne were accused of failing to protect workers in the company\u2019s four Italian factories before they were shuttered in 1986. They were also ordered to pay a total of 80 million euros ($105 million) to more than 6,000 people, including former workers and residents who lived near their plants.  Bruno Pesce, the leader of Italy\u2019s asbestos victims association, said more than 1,500 people attended Monday\u2019s hearing \u2013 including some who were suffering from asbestos-linked illnesses.  \u201cIt was a very emotional moment,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cPeople were crying because of tension and then of happiness.\u201d Judge Giuseppe Casalbore needed three hours to read the sentence at Monday\u2019s hearing, held in the Italian industrial hub of Turin.  Prosecutors argued that Schmidheiny and de Cartier failed to take steps to protect workers from asbestos, now known to cause cancer. The verdict \u201cis an incredible step forward\u201d and \u201ca milestone for justice worldwide, since asbestos is not only manufactured in Italy,\u201d prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello said after the hearing.  Eternit did not respond to a request for comment on the decision. But Renato Balduzzi, Italy\u2019s health minister, called the sentence \u201chistoric.\u201d  Asbestos was once widely used as a fireproofing material and was included in roof shingles and siding for decades. Though now banned in Italy and most Western countries, asbestos is still used in developing countries, mainly in China and India. Barry Castelman, an environmental scientist from the United States who testified as an expert witness in the Turin case, said asbestos and cancer had been linked since the 1950s.  \u201cThe importance of today\u2019s sentence is that it establishes a personal criminal responsibility of the production firm\u2019s executives, who will now learn the lesson,\u201d Castelman said.

        "content": "Greeks look set to pay a heavy price for the latest bailout package aimed at rescuing the debt-stricken country and preventing the crisis spreading throughout the eurozone. The austerity measures needed to secure another \u20ac130 billion ($172.6 billion) in loans were greeted with rioting on the streets of Athens\u2026 incurring yet another cost. The bill for cleaning up after the violence has been put at \u20ac70 million ($92 million) by the Athens Chamber of Commerce and detailed on the Greek website Capital.gr. But that figure looks small compared to the longer-term sacrifices the Greek people are required to make under the reform package approved by the Greek parliament on Sunday night. Under the plan described by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos as \u201ctough\u201d and \u201cpainful\u201d the national debt has to be reduced from 160% of GDP to 120% by the end of the decade. In order to do this, Greece has to make some severe cuts. More assurances are being sought before the money is approved but  the Greek parliament has pledged to: \u2022 Reduce the minimum wage straight away from \u20ac751 ($989) to \u20ac600 ($790) per month. For those under 25, the minimum wage will be slashed by 32% \u2022 Cut pension provision and include a \u201cstrict link between contributions and benefits\u201d \u2022 Make 15,000 public sector workers redundant by the end of the year. It must also give regular budget reports to the so-called troika \u2013 made up of the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund \u2013 who are helping to finance Greece.  But the austerity measures do not end there.  In a long list of proposed reforms, the Greek government resolved to modernize the health system, keeping public health expenditure at or below 6% of GDP. It also means cutting overtime pay for hospital doctors to save at least \u20ac50 million ($66 million), and a plan to reduce spending on medicines by more than \u20ac1 billion ($1.32 billion) in 2012. The government hopes to make the saving by using less expensive and generic medicines. Among other measures, the military budget will be cut by \u20ac300 million ($395 million) and spending on public investments reduced by \u20ac400 million ($527 million). Public sector workers face further wage cuts while the government proposes a largescale privatization program with the aim of collecting billions of euros \u201cin the medium term.\u201d It intends to overhaul the tax system and crack down on widespread tax evasion that has plagued the Greek economy for years by, among other things, installing a new IT system and introducing automatic deductions from wages.  Many analysts are concerned that the severe austerity measures could make matters worse. As the clean-up from the Athens rioting began, Greek political expert Roman Gerodimos warned that extreme austerity could provide ideal conditions for extremist views to thrive. \u201cThe political system in Greece is changing and the repercussions may well be felt across Europe and the world,\u201d he said. The Greek government has recognized that cuts alone will not be enough to save the country. Greece is in its fifth consecutive year of recession, and the UK\u2019s Financial Times reports Athens bankers as saying the economy is projected to shrink by another 3%. Eurozone crisis map Proposing a \u201cbusiness-friendly Greece\u201d the government has pledged to introduce a stimulus package alongside the cuts that includes simplifying building and operating permits, increasing competition in the energy market and cutting the bureaucracy needed to export.

The Glasgow-based club, who have been champions of Scotland 54 times, confirmed they had filed documents at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, which gives them ten days to appoint an administrator. Rangers, who form one half of the famous \u2018Old Firm\u2019 rivalry with city neighbors Celtic, are awaiting the outcome of a tribunal which will rule whether they owe Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) more than \u00a350 million ($78m) in tax. The club\u2019s chairman, Craig Whyte said there was \u201cno realistic or practical alternative\u201d to Rangers\u2019 decision and said he was committed to ensuring their long-term future. If the club were to go into administration they would be docked ten points by the Scottish Premier League, which would see them remain second but fall 14 points behind leaders Celtic. In a statement on the club\u2019s website Whyte said it was clear since his takeover in May 2011 that \u201cthe club was facing massive financial challenges both in terms of its ongoing financial structure and performance and the potential consequences of the HMRC first tier tax tribunal.\u201d He added: \u201cI have taken the decision that the most practical way to safeguard the long-term future of the club is to go through a formal restructuring process. It may still be possible to avert this but that is not the most likely way forward. \u201cWhat is of paramount importance is the long-term security, survival and prosperity of this great football club.\u201d The case against Rangers centers around the use of employee benefits trusts (EBTs) which the club previously used to pay their players. HMRC insist the club used the method as a way to avoid paying tax and Whyte said Rangers must prepare for the worst.  He added: \u201cThere is no realistic or practical alternative to our approach because HMRC has made it plain to the club that should we be successful in the forthcoming tax tribunal decision they will appeal the decision.  \u201cThis would leave the club facing years of uncertainty and also having to pay immediately a range of liabilities to HMRC which will be due whatever the overall result of the tax tribunal.  \u201cIn blunt terms, if we waited until the outcome of the tax tribunal, the risk of Rangers being faced with an unacceptable financial burden and years of uncertainty is too great.\u201d"

        "content": "It has been a relationship fraught with tension and disagreements, but with Valentine\u2019s Day around the corner, it appears Carlos Tevez and Manchester City might be prepared to kiss and make up. The Argentina striker has been frozen out of the first team picture at City since refusing to warm up as a substitute during a European Champions League defeat to Bayern Munich in Germany back in September. Tevez has since been hit with a massive fine and was widely expected to leave the English Premier League leaders in January, but a move failed to materialize despite interest from Italian giants AC and Inter Milan. City manager Roberto Mancini has now hinted he may be prepared to forgive Tevez, who captained the team to a first trophy in 35 years last season, in a bid to bolster the club\u2019s chances of clinching their first top division title since 1968. Man City return to top of English Premier League  Tevez also said he wanted to play for City again in an interview on Argentinian television but risked further tension by laying the blame for the argument at Mancini and City\u2019s doorstep. \u201cEveryone knows that Tevez is a top player and it probably would have been better for us if he\u2019d been here,\u201d Mancini told a press conference prior to Sunday\u2019s 1-0 win away at Aston Villa, which saw them return to the top of the table. \u201cI don\u2019t have any problem and the club doesn\u2019t have any problem. Finish. It\u2019s up to him. Carlos knows everything, he knows the situation. \u201cI spoke with Carlos one week after Munich \u2026 We are here. We\u2019ve not changed these past few months and Carlos knows that. He is a City player.\u201d But Mancini made it clear Tevez, who is reportedly due to return to Manchester from Argentina this week, would have to apologize before he would get the opportunity to add to the 43 goals he has scored for the club since joining in 2009. \u201cThis is normal,\u201d the former Inter coach said. \u201cThen after Carlos can train, can play, as long as his condition is good. If he comes back, we are happy.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s Suarez apologizes for Evra handshake snub But in an interview with Fox Sports Latin America, Tevez rejected he was to blame for the breakdown in relations. \u201cIf I was wrong, I say sorry. I sincerely believe I did not make a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s true that Mancini said he will welcome me back if I\u2019m fit, then I like those quotes. But if he only said it for the media, no. \u201cBut he also said I was never going to be playing for him again. So I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll do my best to be available and play.\u201d Tevez has been on a collision course with City\u2019s hierarchy for over 12 months, having initially handed in a transfer request in December 2010. The one-time West Ham and Manchester United star then saw a return to former club Santos collapse in July. Tevez has not played for the Citizens since a domestic cup win against second-tier Birmingham City in September. Tevez also revealed he and Mancini nearly came to blows after a Premier League match last season and said that City could have handled the Bayern incident differently. Mancini said he was unsure what condition Tevez would be in upon his return, but said the 28-year-old has the talent to be an asset to City in the closing months of the season.  \u201cI don\u2019t know if he is in good condition or not,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cI don\u2019t think so because he hasn\u2019t played for four months. But Carlos recovers strength very quickly. \u201cCarlos can change a lot of games. If he comes back next week, maybe he can help us in the last three months.\u201d"

        "content": "Abu Qatada, a radical Jordanian cleric described by authorities as an inspiration to September 11 hijacker Mohammed Atta and other terrorists, has been released from British jail on bail, a spokeswoman for the British Ministry of Justice said Monday. Video on UK broadcaster ITN showed Qatada leaving the Long Lartin prison in a van.  Qatada, 51, has been jailed in Britain since 2005 while the government works to deport him to Jordan, where, after he sought asylum in the United Kingdom, he was convicted in absentia of involvement in terrorist conspiracies. On Friday, an immigration court said the government was running out of time to justify Qatada\u2019s continued detention. Justice John Edward Mitting ordered Qatada released from jail under a restrictive set of conditions that requires him to stay in his home 22 hours a day, prohibits him from using computers, phones or other electronic communications, and limits visitors, according to a Home Office spokesman.  Mitting gave the government about three months to make progress or face being forced to release Qatada outright. However, a January 17 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights said that deporting Qatada to Jordan would be a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights because of the likelihood that evidence gained from torture would be used against him. That would violate Qatada\u2019s right to a fair trial, the court ruled. The British government is prepared to do everything in its power to ensure his deportation, the Home Office spokesman said.  \u201cEveryone is united in wanting this man deported,\u201d said the spokesman, who declined to be named in line with policy. \u201cThis government will exhaust all avenues open to get Qatada on a plane. As we do so, we will continue to negotiate with the Jordanians to see what assurance we can be given about the evidence used against Qatada in their courts.\u201d Home Office Minister James Brokenshire is visiting Amman, Jordan, to discuss the case with officials there, according to the British Press Association. Qatada \u2013 also known as Omar Othman \u2013 arrived in the United Kingdom in 1993 and applied for asylum on the grounds that he had been tortured by Jordanian authorities. He came to the United Kingdom on a forged United Arab Emirates passport, according to court documents, and claimed asylum for himself, his wife and their three children. The British government recognized him as a refugee and allowed him to stay in the country until 1998. Qatada applied to stay indefinitely, but while his application was pending, a Jordanian court convicted him in absentia on charges related to two 1998 terrorist attacks and a plot to plant bombs to coincide with the millennium. He was released briefly in 2005 after the repeal of the anti-terrorism law on which he was being held. British authorities ordered his renewed detention that year under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, according to the European Court of Human Rights. The British government claims that Qatada is a national security risk who has raised money for terrorist groups, including organizations linked to Osama bin Laden, and has publicly supported the violent activities of those groups. Qatada has denied the allegations."

A 41-year-old Ecuadorian man has been arrested in the Esplugues de Llobregat suburb of Barcelona, according to the police statement released Saturday.

        "content": "Spain\u2019s Supreme Court on Monday dropped a case against the nation\u2019s best-known judge, Baltasar Garzon, saying the statute of limitations had expired on the alleged abuse involving some courses he taught at New York University years ago. The ruling comes just days after a seven-judge panel at the Supreme Court convicted him in a separate case for improperly ordering wiretaps while investigating financial corruption and suspended him from the bench for 11 years. Garzon has vowed to appeal that conviction, but many analysts say the 56-year-old judge \u2013who became known internationally for investigating human rights abuses under the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet \u2013 may have a hard time regaining a judgeship while any appeal is pending. Another trial against Garzon \u2013 concerning his investigation of human rights abuses under the former dictatorship of Francisco Franco in Spain \u2013 ended Wednesday and is awaiting a verdict from a different panel of Supreme Court judges. Human rights groups say the three cases, especially for his investigation of Franco, amount to a vendetta against Garzon. He has been under suspension since 2010 pending the trials. In the Supreme Court decision Monday, investigating magistrate Manuel Marchena ruled there would be no trial and charges would be dropped because the statute of limitations had expired. In this case as well as the other two, state prosecutors had not brought charges against Garzon but private parties had. Private prosecution is allowed under Spanish law. They argued that Garzon, when teaching judicial courses at New York University in 2005 and 2006, had improperly approached some of Spain\u2019s largest companies for donations to underwrite the cost of the courses. Some of those companies had cases pending before Garzon\u2019s court, the private prosecution alleged. Garzon maintained his innocence \u2013 as he has in all three cases \u2013 and said he never solicited funds for the courses, which instead was done, he said, by a university official. The wiretapping case was tried last month and the verdict was issued Thursday. It centered on Garzon\u2019s investigation into the financial corruption scandal known as Gurtel, for which some leading conservative politicians, among others, have recently been brought to trial. Garzon said his wiretap orders, in early 2009, were backed by state prosecutors. He testified that he ordered the wiretaps on suspicion that suspects in the case were involved in money laundering while they were in preventative prison. But the Supreme Court judges wrote, \u201cThe central question to be resolved in this case is related to the fundamental right of defense for the suspect, against the legitimate interest of the State to pursue crimes,\u201d the sentence said. \u201cIt is not possible to have a just process if the right of defense is essentially eliminated.\u201d The sentence added that Garzon\u2019s investigation had the effect of \u201cadmitting practices which now are found only in totalitarian regimes where anything is considered valid to obtain the desired information.\u201d Garzon\u2019s possible avenues for appeal include the Constitutional Court \u2013 Spain\u2019s highest court, which rules on constitutional issues \u2013 or to the European Court for Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. Human rights groups, which have sent observers to the trials, consider the second case against Garzon \u2013 for his investigation of mass graves under Franco\u2019s rule \u2013 to be the more important one. In that case, a small civil servants union called Manos Limpias, or Clean Hands, brought a private prosecution against Garzon, charging him with ignored an amnesty law approved in the Spanish Parliament in 1977, two years after Franco\u2019s death. In that trial, which ended last week and is awaiting a verdict, Garzon testified that he searched but could not find any national census of how many people disappeared or their identities. So he decided to investigate because he considered those to be \u201cpermanent crimes\u201d which still affect their descendants, since the remains have never been found. He said he began to see evidence that there was a \u201csystematic plan\u201d against Franco\u2019s opponents, which he said included forced disappearances, illegal detentions and assassinations. The military uprising in 1936 triggered the three-year Spanish Civil War. The war ended when Franco\u2019s forces defeated Republican and leftist fighters. Franco\u2019s dictatorship continued until his death. Mass graves from the regime are still being unearthed, said Emilio Silva, from a group called Historical Memory. Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch said last week, \u201cThis is a trial that should never have been held, but which at least served to show that Garzon acted in accordance with international law, which imposes on states a duty to investigate the worst international crimes.\u201d \u201cThe Supreme Court should put an end to this sorry episode for Spanish justice by acquitting judge Garzon of all the charges against him,\u201d Brody added. \u201cInvestigating state killings and \u2018disappearances\u2019 should never be considered a crime.\u201d Since his suspension in 2010, Garzon has been working as a legal adviser outside of Spain on human rights cases and judicial issues, including in Latin America."

        "content": "Cristiano Ronaldo grabbed his sixth hat-trick this season as Real Madrid went 10 points clear of arch-rivals Barcelona in Spain with a 4-2 home win over fourth-placed Levante. Sunday\u2019s victory left Real in the driving seat to win the La Liga title following champions Barca\u2019s 3-2 defeat at Osasuna on Saturday. Portugal star Ronaldo took his league tally to 27 goals this season with another superb display, but Gustavo Cabral gave Levante a surprise early lead in the Bernabeu. Ronaldo, the world\u2019s most expensive player, leveled from the penalty spot following a handball by Vicente Iborra, who was also sent off for his second yellow card. Ronaldo headed home a Gonzalo Higuain cross after 49 minutes and then completed his 13th hat-trick for Real with a thunderous drive that took him past legendary Hungarian forward Ferenc Puskas and into second place behind Alfredo di Stefano\u2019s total of 22 trebles for the club. Brave Levante pulled one back through Arouna Kone\u2019s header, but France forward Karim  Benzema sealed three points for Jose Mourinho\u2019s men with a fourth after 65 minutes. Mourinho cautioned against thinking the title is already won despite opening such a big gap over Barca.  \u201cThe mathematics tell us that to consider this league won, it\u2019s necessary  to get another 39 points, that\u2019s 13 wins,\u201d he told AFP. Earlier, third-placed Valencia moved eight points clear of the chasing pack with a 4-0 victory over struggling Sporting Gijon, ending a run of five league matches without a win. Sofiane Feghouli opened the scoring in the 34th minute, and his 73rd-minute effort was deflected in for an own-goal by Alberto Botia. Substitute Jonas Goncalves scored twice in injury time as Valencia moved to within eight points of Barcelona, while Gijon remained second from bottom."

        "content": "The British lawyer for alleged victims of phone-hacking by newspapers said Monday he is flying to the United States within weeks to meet lawyers amid reports he may take legal action against media magnate Rupert Murdoch. Mark Lewis, who is representing dozens of individuals who say their phones were hacked by Murdoch\u2019s UK titles, confirmed to CNN he would meet lawyers, but declined to comment on the reports he planned to sue Murdoch. Lewis said the purpose of his planned visit was \u201cas always to represent my clients properly.\u201d His clients include the family of Milly Dowler, a missing teenager whose voice mail was allegedly hacked by News of The World before she was found murdered. Public outrage over the allegations led News International to shut down the tabloid in July. Police in London are investigating the hacking claims as well as suspected corruption involving public officials. As part of this investigation, officers on Saturday arrested five senior journalists at Murdoch\u2019s top-selling tabloid The Sun over allegations of improper payments to police and officials. A police officer, an employee of the Ministry of Defence and a member of the armed forces were also detained. Last year Lewis told CNN he was \u201clooking to pursue legal action on the basis of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States, whereby a holding company can be liable for practices outside the jurisdiction where the offence is said to have taken place.\u201d  \u201cProceedings will be issued in the U.S. where we will seek information from the company\u2019s directors about those issues and about corporate governance.\u201d The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, enacted in 1977, makes it illegal for a U.S. person or company to pay foreign officials to obtain or retain business. Potential liability flows from journalists at News of the World to its parent, News International, and to that company\u2019s parent, News Corp., which is a publicly held company in the United States, and runs Fox News. Meanwhile, Murdoch is flying to London this week in what News International described as a scheduled visit. But his trip comes days after he issued a personal assurance to one of his executives to continue to own and publish The Sun newspaper, according to an internal staff memo sent by News International Chief Executive Tom Mockridge. Mockridge said he was \u201cvery saddened\u201d by the arrests of deputy editor Geoff Webster, picture editor John Edwards, chief reporter John Kay, chief foreign correspondent Nick Parker, and John Sturgis, who is a news editor. The five journalists were arrested at their homes, police said. \u201cI understand the pressure many of you are under and have the greatest admiration for everyone\u2019s continued professionalism,\u201d Mockridge wrote. An editorial in The Sun on Monday said police dawn raids against its journalists were part of a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d that had left Britain behind former Soviet states on press freedom. \u201cThe Sun is not a \u2018swamp\u2019 that needs draining,\u201d wrote associate editor Trevor Kavanagh. \u201cNor are those other great News International titles, The Times and The Sunday Times,\u201d he added. \u201cYet in what would at any other time cause uproar in parliament and among civil liberty and human rights campaigners, its journalists are being treated like members of an organized crime gang.\u201d Other journalists also expressed concern about the arrests. Tony Parsons, a columnist on the Daily Mirror tweeted: \u201cIn any other country, having the police rounding up journalists at dawn is seen as a sign of repression. Why is it meant to be healthy here?\u201d The publisher of News of the World tabloid last week paid out hundreds of thousands of pounds to settle lawsuits over phone hacking, including former Prime Minister Tony Blair\u2019s spokesman. The publisher apologized for intercepting phone messages of Alastair Campbell, the Blair aide, and agreed to pay costs and damages, Campbell said in a statement. He did not say how much the settlement was worth. With Wednesday\u2019s settlements, News Group Newspapers has settled 59 of the 60 lawsuits against it. But former child singing star Charlotte Church, who has testified publicly about the damage phone hacking did to her personal life, has refused to settle. Her case is expected to go to court as soon as this month. Comic actor Steve Coogan, who settled for \u00a340,000 ($63,000) and legal costs, echoed the words of many who have sued over phone hacking. \u201cThis has never been about money,\u201d he said. \u201cLike other people who have sued, I was determined to do my part to show the depths to which the press can sink in pursuit of private information.\u201d British Prime Minister David Cameron set up an independent inquiry into press ethics and practices in response to the scandal, and police are carrying out three separate investigations into elements of it. Two parliamentary committees are also investigating the scandal."

        "content": "Anger over Greece\u2019s austerity measures exploded in the streets of Athens early Monday as tens of thousands of protesters clashed with police in riots that left 106 police officers and dozens of civilians injured, according to police. The riot, widely described as one of the worst in Athens since Greece began dealing with its crippling debt crisis in 2010, broke out after the Greek Parliament approved a new package of austerity measures in return for a new eurozone bailout of the debt-stricken country. Protesters among a crowd estimated by police at about 80,000 hurled rocks and firebombs toward police. Officers responded with tear gas. At least 74 people were arrested, police said. Police said investigators were still tallying property damages, but the Athens News Agency said more than 45 buildings were damaged by fire and numerous others were looted. Among the damaged buildings were a bank, cafes and a movie theater, the news agency reported. The violent protests reflect increasing angst in Greece over crushing economic problems, said CNN iReporter Thanasis Trompoukis. \u201cThey are protesting because they feel that there is no end in their financial suffering. More and more (people) every day are getting poorer and become homeless in Greece, and especially Athens,\u201d he said. Photos: Police scatter Greek protesters with tear gas  The package, which includes deep cuts in government spending, wages and pensions, will help pave the way for eurozone finance ministers to sign off on the new \u20ac130 billion ($172.6 billion) bailout deal. It passed Parliament in a 199-74 vote. Greece needs the funds in order to meet \u20ac14.5 billion in debt repayments due next month. Speaking before the vote, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos called for calm. \u201cThis vandalism, violence, they have no place in a democracy and will not be tolerated,\u201d he told lawmakers, urging them to approve the deal. \u201cAt this critical time, we don\u2019t have the luxury of such conflicts,\u201d he said. Echoing comments he made in a speech to the Cabinet Saturday evening, Papademos warned lawmakers the government would not be able to pay salaries, cover services or import basic goods if the plan was not approved. He spoke about the possibility of \u201ccatastrophic bankruptcy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a hard program, a tough program, which also envisages some painful sacrifices,\u201d he said, adding that the plan would put Greece back on \u201cstable ground.\u201d Protesters criticizing the program have demonstrated for days. Interactive: How do eurozone figures stack up? On Saturday, some isolated scuffles broke out as protesters rallied in Syntagma Square, in front of the Parliament building, but the mood was calmer than a day earlier. Friday\u2019s protest dispersed after youths smashed pavements and began throwing stones and pieces of marble, as well as Molotov cocktails, at the police, who responded with stun grenades and teargas. Monday\u2019s protests are being widely described as some of the worst since the Greek debt crisis began in 2010. In May of that year, three people died when a fire bomb hit a bank in central Athens during protests over austerity measures. Even though the sweeping reform package agreed to by Greece and the so-called troika \u2013 made up of the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund \u2013 was approved in Parliament, Greek lawmakers must still do more.  Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister of Luxembourg and head of the Eurogroup, which brings together euro-area finance ministers, said Thursday that other assurances were also needed from Athens before the bailout could be paid out. Greece\u2019s political leaders must pledge that they will continue to implement the measures after upcoming elections, he said. Athens must also find a further \u20ac325 million in \u201cstructural expenditure\u201d cuts for 2012, Juncker added. The bailout deal, which would result in significant losses for bondholders, is intended to help reduce Greece\u2019s debts to 120% of gross domestic product by 2020, from about 160% currently. Greece, which owes some \u20ac330 billion, has come close to default before. The nation has struggled to follow through on austerity measures and economic reforms that were a condition of its 2010 bailout package. At the same time, the Greek economy has been in recession for years and many analysts warn that additional austerity could make the situation worse. U.S. and European stocks were higher Monday morning following passage of the austerity package. Stock markets have been anxious about the potential impact of a Greek default on the European and world economies."

Woods has it all over Mickelson with 14 major titles and 71 overall on the U.S. circuit, but had to play second fiddle as \u201cLefty\u201d joined an elite group of players with 40 tour victories as he overcame a six-shot deficit to win the AT&T National Pro-Am. Four-time major winner Mickelson overhauled overnight leader Charlie Wi with a stunning eight-under-par 64 to win by two shots and claim his first win since April last year. It was the fifth time in a row Mickelson had outshot Woods when they have been grouped together in the final round, and the 12th time he had bettered him when they have played together. \u201cI love playing with him, and he brings out some of my best golf,\u201d four-time major winner Mickelson told the PGA Tour\u2019s official website.  \u201cI just seem more focused. I know that his level of play is so much greater when he\u2019s playing his best than anybody else\u2019s, that it just forces me to focus on my game more intently and hit more precise shots.\u201d Former world No. 1 Woods has not won a sanctioned tournament since November 2009, and is without a victory in his last 23 PGA Tour events \u2013 the longest winless streak of his professional career. The American began the final round four shots off the lead, but carded five bogeys in a nightmare 75. \u201cIt was frustrating,\u201d said the 36-year-old after finishing tied for 15th place, having started the day in third.  \u201cI was looking for two or three under though the first six or seven holes, and Phil is the one who got off to that start.\u201d The highlight of Mickelson\u2019s round was a 21-foot eagle putt at the par-five fifth hole. \u201cThe eagle to me was as important as any (shot),\u201d said Mickelson, who has risen to 11th in the world rankings and became the ninth player to register 40 wins on the PGA Tour. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to make a four. I\u2019m not playing aggressively for a three off the tee. It\u2019s an awkward shot for me. If I get it turning over at all it just runs into the ocean.\u201d South Korea\u2019s Wi finished second on 15 under after carding a 72, with Ricky Barnes third on 13 under following a round of 67. Australia\u2019s Aaron Baddeley was one shot further back after a 67, ahead of American duo Kevin Na (70) and world No. 10 Dustin Johnson (70) on 11 under. Three-time major winner Padraig Harrington (70) and Ken Duke (74) of the U.S. were tied for seventh on 10 under. Six players tied for ninth on nine under, one stroke ahead of Woods. Alongside Woods on eight under were his Ryder Cup teammate Hunter Mahan (73), Richard H. Lee (69), Bob Estes (72) and Australia\u2019s Steven Bowditch (68). Former world No. 1 Vijay Singh (73) finished in a four-way tie for 25th, while 2003 U.S. Open champion Jim Furyk (71) was tied for 40th."

Ivory Coast captain Didier Drogba missed a penalty in the second half of regulation play as the match ended scoreless after extra time. Both teams were successful with their first seven penalties of the shootout, including Drogba, until Manchester City defender Kolo Toure saw his effort saved by Zambia goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene. Rainford Kalaba then missed the chance to clinch the game for Zambia when he shot over. With the tension almost unbearable, Arsenal forward Gervinho blazed his penalty wide, and this time Zambia\u2019s Stoppila Sunzu made no mistake to give his side an emotional victory. It was a fairytale triumph for Zambia, who returned to Gabon 19 years after the plane crash which claimed the lives of the team\u2019s coach and 18 members of their squad. The Copper Bullets finally won Africa\u2019s top football prize after losing in two previous finals, while the favored Elephants suffered a shootout defeat again after a similar heartbreak against Egypt in 2006 \u2013 when Drogba also missed a penalty. Zambia\u2019s French coach Herve Renard was overjoyed. \u201cThis represents something enormous, something which appeared unrealizable before the competition began,\u201d he told AFP. \u201cI know we\u2019re not the best but we have a strength and force that animated  our team.\u201d But for Chelsea striker Drogba and his star-studded team it was a bitter disappointment after not conceding a goal in open play in their six matches in the tournament. Clear-cut chances were few and far between in wet conditions, but Ivorian  goalkeeper Boubacar Barry had to make a brilliant early save to foil Nathan Sinkala. Drogba set up Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure for his side\u2019s best chance of the first half, but the African player of the year fired wide. Ivory Coast\u2019s 72nd-minute penalty came after Gervinho was pushed over, but Drogba\u2019s effort never threatened the goal. His Zambian counterpart Christopher Katongo hit the woodwork in extra time before the drama of penalties and victory for the underdogs."

United had briefly hit the summit after Saturday\u2019s 2-1 win over Liverpool, but Roberto Mancini\u2019s side showed their mettle with a hard-fought win at Villa Park. City dominated possession and might have gone ahead in the first half as England winger Adam Johnson hit the post with a long-range effort. England international defender Lescott took his chance from close range after Gareth Barry headed David Silva\u2019s corner across goal. Villa, who have slipped to 15th after five defeats in seven home games, staged a late rally and Carlos Cuellar might have scored with a free header. England goalkeeper Joe Hart also made a superb save to deny fellow international Darren Bent from close range as Villa pressed to salvage a point. Suarez apologizes for Evra handshake snub \u201cThis was a difficult game.

The defeat left Wolves deep in relegation trouble, and manager Mick McCarthy was sacked on Monday despite apologizing to fans after the match. The former Sunderland and Republic of Ireland boss joined Wolves in 2006 and kept the club in the top flight for two seasons after winning promotion in 2009, but paid the price for a run of just 14 points in 22 league games. In Italy\u2019s Serie A, Inter Milan\u2019s poor recent run continued with a 1-0 defeat to bottom club Novara Sunday. The 2010 European champions have now gone five games without a win after Andrea Caracciolo scored the only goal for the strugglers.

The Uruguay international was widely criticized for Saturday\u2019s snub which came as they met face to face for the first time since he was given an eight-game ban for racially abusing the Frenchman at an earlier fixture between the two clubs in October. United manager Alex Ferguson called Suarez a \u201cdisgrace\u201d while Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre was angered by his own player\u2019s actions. \u201cWe are extremely disappointed Luis Suarez did not shake hands with Patrice  Evra before yesterday\u2019s game.

Suarez, who scored Liverpool\u2019s late goal in the 2-1 defeat, made his public apology later Sunday on the club\u2019s website. \u201cI have spoken with the manager (Kenny Dalglish) since the game at Old Trafford and I realize I got things wrong. \u201cI\u2019ve not only let him down, but also the club and what it stands for and I\u2019m sorry.

At the final whistle, Evra openly celebrated his team\u2019s victory in close proximity to Suarez and also drew a rebuke from his manager Ferguson. United responded later Sunday to the apology with a statement on their official website: \u201cManchester United thanks Liverpool for the apologies issued following Saturday\u2019s game. \u201cEveryone at Old Trafford wants to move on from this.

Twenty-five protesters and 40 officers were injured in the clashes, which occurred throughout the city, police said. Authorities detained at least 30 people. \u201cThey are protesting because they feel that there is no end in their financial suffering. More and more (people) everyday are getting poorer and become homeless in Greece, and especially Athens,\u201d wrote CNN iReporter Thanasis Trompoukis. The package, which includes deep cuts in government spending, wages and pensions, will help pave the way for eurozone finance ministers to sign off on the new \u20ac130 billion ($172.6 billion) bailout deal. It passed Parliament in a 199-74 vote. Greece needs the funds in order to meet \u20ac14.5 billion in debt repayments due next month. Speaking before the vote, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos called for calm. \u201cThis vandalism, violence, they have no place in a democracy and will not be tolerated,\u201d he told lawmakers, urging them to approve the deal. \u201cAt this critical time, we don\u2019t have the luxury of such conflicts,\u201d he said. Echoing comments he made in a speech to the Cabinet Saturday evening, Papademos warned lawmakers the government would not be able to pay salaries, cover services or import basic goods if the plan was not approved. He spoke about the possibility of \u201ccatastrophic bankruptcy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a hard program, a tough program, which also envisages some painful sacrifices,\u201d he said, adding that the plan would put Greece back on \u201cstable ground.\u201d Protesters criticizing the program have demonstrated for days. On Saturday, some isolated scuffles broke out as protesters rallied in Syntagma Square, in front of the Parliament building, but the mood was calmer than a day earlier. Friday\u2019s protest dispersed after youths smashed pavements and began throwing stones and pieces of marble, as well as Molotov cocktails, at the police, who responded with stun grenades and teargas. Even though the sweeping reform package agreed to by Greece and the so-called troika \u2013 made up of the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund \u2013 was approved in Parliament, Greek lawmakers must still do more.  Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister of Luxembourg and head of the Eurogroup, which brings together euro-area finance ministers, said Thursday that other assurances were also needed from Athens before the bailout could be paid out. Greece\u2019s political leaders must pledge that they will continue to implement the measures after upcoming elections, he said. Athens must also find a further \u20ac325 million in \u201cstructural expenditure\u201d cuts for 2012, Juncker added. The bailout deal, which would result in significant losses for bondholders, is intended to help reduce Greece\u2019s debts to 120% of Gross Domestic Product by 2020, from about 160% currently. Greece, which owes some \u20ac330 billion, has come close to default before. The nation has struggled to follow through on austerity measures and economic reforms that were a condition of its 2010 bailout package. At the same time, the Greek economy has been in recession for years and many analysts warn that additional austerity could make the situation worse."

Ruben Castro put Betis ahead after 10 minutes but Bilbao drew  level 12 minutes later when Javi Martinez headed home from a corner.  Jefferson Montero and Castro both hit the woodwork either side of the break as pressure mounted on Bilbao\u2019s defenses. This only intensified when goalscorer Martinez was sent off for his second bookable offence in the 64th minute.

Antonio Di Natale gave fourth-placed Udinese the lead in the 19th minute which they held onto until the final minutes of the match.  Argentine striker Maxi Lopez equalized 13 minutes from time before 19-year-old Stephan El Shaarawy scored the winning goal in the 85th minute thus ending Udinese\u2019s unbeaten home record this season.

Both Westwood and Gallacher had putts on the final green to force a playoff but missed to leave Cabrera-Bello to celebrate the biggest win of his career with an 18-under total of 270.

        "content": "Manchester United went top of the English Premier League on Saturday with a 2-1 win over Liverpool at Old Trafford, but it was Luis Suarez who grabbed the headlines again.  Suarez, who was starting his first match since returning from an eight-match ban for racially abusing United defender Patrice Evra last October, refused to shake the French international\u2019s hand as the team\u2019s lined up before the match. Suarez fined, suspended over racist remarks It was the precursor to a fractious encounter with both sets of players reportedly clashing in the tunnel at halftime and having to be restrained after the final whistle.  On the pitch, the game was ignited by Wayne Rooney who struck twice in three minutes at the start of the second half after a goalless first period. The England striker volleyed home in the 47th minute before latching on to a Antonio Valencia pass moments later to slot the ball past Pepe Reina.  Liverpool\u2019s attempts to half the deficit were rewarded with a Suarez goal in the 80th minute but a spirited search for an equalizer ended in vain.  The arguments over the handshake incident went on after the match.  Alex Ferguson called Suarez \u201ca disgrace\u201d saying he should never be allowed to represent the Merseyside club again.  Reds\u2019 boss Dalglish refused to be drawn on the issue saying he hadn\u2019t see it.   The loss keeps Liverpool in seventh place on 39 points while United now have 58 points, one point more than Manchester City who travel to Aston Villa on Sunday.  Harry Redknapp capped a highly satisfying week as he watched his Tottenham Hotspur side thrash Newcastle United 5-0 at White Hart Lane.  Benoit Assou-Ekotto opened the scoring in the fourth minute, with recent signing Louis Saha doubling the lead two minutes later.  Saha was on target again in the 20th minute with Niko Kranjcar adding a fourth ten minutes before halftime.  Emmanuel Adebayor made it five in the 64th minute to complete the rout.  The win consolidates Spurs\u2019 grip on third place while leaving them five points behind leaders Manchester United.   Chelsea slipped out of the top four as they lost to Everton 2-0 at Goodison Park.  Steven Peinaar put the Toffees ahead in the fifth minute with Denis Stracqualursi adding a second midway through the second half.  The result moves Everton up to 10th with 33 points while Chelsea drop to fifth behind Arsenal who beat Sunderland 2-1 at the Stadium of Light.     Thierry Henry\u2019s strike in stoppage time saw Arsene Wenger\u2019s team take all three points after going behind to a goal from James Mclean in the 70th minute.  Aaron Ramsey put the Gunners back on level terms before a volley by on-loan Henry sealed a dramatic victory and Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s first home defeat since taking over as Sunderland boss in December last year. Blackburn Rovers bounced back from their 7-1 thrashing at the hands of Arsenal last week with a 3-2 win over Queens Park Rangers at Ewood Park. First-half goals from French midfielder Steven Nzonzi, Yakubu and an own goal from Nedum Onuoha proved enough to defeat Mark Hughes side despite two second half goals from his Scottish striker Jamie Mackie.  The win lifts Blackburn to 18th level on 21 points with QPR who are two places higher thanks to a superior goal difference. Bottom-of-the-table Wigan also enjoyed a rare victory defeating Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium.  Scottish defender Gary Caldwell put Wigan in front two minutes before the break. Mark Davies equalised in the 67th minute for Bolton but James McArthur\u2019s 76th minute tap-in sealed Wigan\u2019s fourth league win of the season.  Roberto Martinez\u2019s team remain in last place but are now only one point adrift of Bolton who switch places with Blackburn. Norwich City are up to eighth in the table after beating Swansea City 3-2 at the Liberty Stadium. Danny Graham put the hosts ahead in the 23rd minute before the Canaries hit back with three second-half goals \u2013 two from striker Grant Holt, the other from Anthony Pilkington. Graham got his second of the match for Swansea three minutes from the end but it couldn\u2019t deny Norwich their ninth league win of the season. Fulham moved level on 30 points with Stoke City after they beat Tony Pulis\u2019 side at Craven Cottage.  Pavel Pogrebnyak gave the Cottagers the lead in the 16th minute. Twelve minutes later Clint Dempsey\u2019s strike was tipped onto the bar by Danish keeper Thomas Sorensen who then saw the ball rebound back onto him and into the net.    Ryan Shawcross pulled one back for Stoke in the 78th minute but Fulham held on for all three points.      "

Police detained Vladimir Milisavljevic and two men at a restaurant in the Mediterranean coastal city of Valencia, the Spanish Ministry of Interior said Friday.  Milisavljevic was sentenced in absentia to more than 30 years in prison for his role in the killing of the prime minister, who was shot by a sniper outside his Democratic Party headquarters in Belgrade on March 12, 2003.  Authorities arrested Milisavljevic following a nearly two-year investigation that culminated Thursday when he made a shopping trip from Las Palmas in the Canaries \u2013 where he had been in hiding \u2013 to Madrid and later Valencia, the ministry said. The two men arrested with him are believed to be members of the Serbian paramilitary group known as Arkan\u2019s Tigers widely credited with running a terror campaign after the Yugoslav war broke out in 1991.  After the war, some members of Arkan\u2019s Tigers became part of the Zemun Clan, a Serbian mafia group.  One of the two men, Luka Bojovic, is accused of leading the Zemun Clan and is wanted in Holland for suspicion of murder and money laundering, according to Interpol. He also faces charges in Serbia for an alleged connection to the killing of Djindjic, the ministry said.

        "content": "Authorities arrested eight people Saturday \u2013 including five journalists of Britain\u2019s bestselling Sun newspaper \u2013 as part of an inquiry into alleged illegal payments to police and officials. The other three are a police officer, an employee of the Ministry of Defence and a member of the armed forces, the Metropolitan Police said. A search was carried out at News International\u2019s offices in east London, the police said, as well as the homes of those arrested. News International, which owns the Sun, is a U.K. subsidiary of media mogul Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp. Following the arrests, Murdoch, chairman and CEO of News Corp, issued a personal assurance to one of his executives to continue to own and publish The Sun newspaper, according to an internal staff memo sent by News International Chief Executive Tom Mockridge. Mockridge also said he was \u201cvery saddened\u201d by the arrests of deputy editor Geoff Webster, picture editor John Edwards, chief reporter John Kay, chief foreign correspondent Nick Parker, and John Sturgis, who is a news editor. The five journalists were arrested at their homes, police said. \u201cI understand the pressure many of you are under and have the greatest admiration for everyone\u2019s continued professionalism,\u201d Mockridge wrote. \u201cThe Sun has a proud history of delivering ground-breaking journalism. You should know that I have had a personal assurance today from Rupert Murdoch about his total commitment to continue to own and publish The Sun newspaper. \u201cToday we are facing our greatest challenge,\u201d Mockridge said.  The Sun\u2019s editor, Dominic Mohan, said in a statement: \u201cI\u2019m as shocked as anyone by today\u2019s arrests but am determined to lead The Sun through these difficult times.  \u201cI have a brilliant staff and we have a duty to serve our readers and will continue to do that. Our focus is on putting out Monday\u2019s newspaper.\u201d Mohan has said the paper has a readership of more than 7.7 million. The arrests are part of Operation Elveden, an investigation running in parallel with a police inquiry into alleged phone hacking by the media, the police statement said. Late Saturday, all eight people were released after posting bail, police said.  News Corp.\u2019s Management and Standards Committee said it had provided the information to the Elveden investigation which led to Saturday\u2019s operation. Elveden has been widened out to include alleged corruption involving public officials, as well as the police.  The five journalists, with ages between 45 and 68, were arrested at their residences in London, Kent and Essex on suspicion of corruption, aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office, and conspiracy in relation to both offenses, police said. News Corp. said in a statement that it \u201cremains committed to ensuring that unacceptable news gathering practices by individuals in the past will not be repeated.\u201d The other three suspects were arrested on suspicion of corruption, misconduct in a public office, and conspiracy in relation to both these offenses. A 39-year-old officer with Surrey Police is being questioned at a London police station, the Met Police said.  The Ministry of Defence employee, a 39-year-old woman, is being questioned at a police station in Wiltshire, as is the member of the armed forces, a 36-year-old man. The police said the operation \u201crelates to suspected payments to police officers and public officials and is not about seeking journalists to reveal confidential sources in relation to information that has been obtained legitimately.\u201d The Ministry of Defence said it was a matter for the Metropolitan Police and that it could not comment on an ongoing police investigation. The latest arrests come two weeks after four current and former Sun employees and a London police officer were arrested in connection with Operation Elveden.  News Corp. established its Management and Standards Committee in the wake of the summer 2011 scandal over alleged hacking of voicemail, which led to the closure of the News of the World Sunday tabloid. The revelation that a murdered 13-year-old girl\u2019s phone was hacked by journalists in search of stories \u2013 and that many other crime and terror victims, politicians and celebrities had also been targeted \u2013 prompted widespread outrage in Britain. News Group Newspapers, part of News International, paid out hundreds of thousands of pounds this week to settle lawsuits over phone hacking from celebrities and politicians, including a former Tony Blair spokesman, Alastair Campbell. The latest settlements meant News Group Newspapers has settled 59 of the 60 lawsuits against it. British Prime Minister David Cameron set up an independent inquiry into press ethics and practices in response to the scandal. Mohan defended his newspaper in testimony before the Leveson Inquiry earlier this month.  \u201cThe Sun is a private enterprise that performs a public duty with a public interest: to inform a mass readership so that British democracy can function properly,\u201d he said in a written witness statement. \u201cThe Sun is occasionally boisterous and often cheeky but it is always a loyal companion to our readers, male and female. It relates to them in a more passionate way than any other title and in doing so it has become Britain\u2019s best-selling newspaper.\u201d Two parliamentary committees are also investigating the scandal. There have been 17 arrests in relation to Operation Weeting, the phone-hacking inquiry, and 21 in connection with Operation Elveden. Three people have been arrested in connection with both investigations. A third police inquiry is investigating alleged email hacking. No one has been charged."

The Cabinet move comes after several ministers resigned from the coalition government and clashes between hooded youths and riot police disrupted a protest rally.  Lawmakers are discussing the bill Saturday before the full Parliament votes on the deal Sunday. In a speech Saturday evening, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos urged the Cabinet to approve the deal, warning of \u201csocial explosion, chaos\u201d if it fails. \u201cThe state will not be able to pay salaries and pensions or import basic goods\u201d such as medicine and fuel, he warned, adding that \u201cunemployment, which is currently unacceptably high, would increase even higher.\u201d Ultimately, Papademos said, if Parliament rejects the deal, Greece \u2013 already in the midst of a prolonged recession \u2013 would be \u201cbankrupted and out of the eurozone.\u201d Parliamentary approval would pave the way for the eurozone finance ministers to sign off on the new \u20ac130 billion ($172.6 billion) bailout deal next week. Greece needs the funds in order to meet \u20ac14.5 billion in debt repayments due next month. Some isolated scuffles broke out as protesters rallied in Syntagma Square, in front of the Parliament building, but the mood was calmer than a day earlier. Friday\u2019s protest dispersed after youths smashed pavements and began throwing stones and pieces of marble, as well as Molotov cocktails, at the police, who responded with stun grenades and teargas. Meanwhile, a 48-hour strike called by trade union leaders in protest against the cuts rolled into its second day Saturday. Former Prime Minister George Papandreou told the PASOK parliamentary group, the majority party in the coalition, that Papademos was right about the urgent need for the deal and that lawmakers must explain to the Greek people what bankruptcy would mean for the country. Antonis Samaras, leader of the New Democracy party, the other main group in the coalition, told his lawmakers that he would call for an early election if a separate agreement was reached on Greece\u2019s private sector debt. In his address to the Cabinet, Papademos said approval of the bailout deal was essential to ensure Greece\u2019s future in the 17-nation eurozone and overcome the current economic crisis. \u201cIt is absolutely necessary to complete the effort that began almost two years to consolidate public finances, restore competitiveness and economic recovery,\u201d he said. Investors in markets around the world watched the Greek Parliament nervously Friday as the drama played out. Even if the sweeping reform package agreed to by Greece and the so-called troika, made up of the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, is approved Sunday in Parliament, Greek lawmakers must still do more.  Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister of Luxembourg and head of the Eurogroup, which brings together euro-area finance ministers, said Thursday that other assurances were also needed from Athens before the bailout could be paid out. Greece\u2019s political leaders must pledge that they will continue to implement the measures after upcoming elections, he said. Athens must also find a further \u20ac325 million in \u201cstructural expenditure\u201d cuts for 2012, Juncker added. It is not clear whether Greece\u2019s lawmakers have yet hammered out a way to make the additional cuts. The leader of the third member of the coalition government, the right-wing LAOS party, told reporters Friday his party would not back the proposed deal. All four of the party\u2019s ministers, including the transport minister and deputy defense minister, then resigned. Deputy Foreign Minister Mariliza Xenogiannakopoulou, of PASOK, also stepped down. LAOS, the smallest member of the coalition, holds 16 seats in the 300-seat parliament, while PASOK has 153 and New Democracy 83.  The bailout deal, which would result in significant losses for bondholders, is intended to help reduce Greece\u2019s debts to 120% of Gross Domestic Product by 2020, from about 160% currently. The austerity measures are expected to include job and wage cuts, as well as pension reforms and other unpopular moves. Greek labor unions have waged protests against the measures this week and the issue has become politically charged ahead of planned elections in April. Greece must also settle with its private sector creditors. Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said Thursday that the \u201cbasic parameters\u201d of a deal had been reached with private sector creditors to write down a portion of the nation\u2019s debt. Greece, which owes some \u20ac330 billion, has come close to default before. The nation has struggled to follow through on austerity measures and economic reforms that were a condition of its 2010 bailout package. At the same time, the Greek economy has been in recession for years and many analysts warn that additional austerity could make the situation worse."

Home favorite Federer was in action for the first time since losing to Rafael Nadal in the semifinals of the Australian Open and could find no answer to an inspired Isner, who won 4-6 6-3 7-6 6-2. It followed an earlier 6-2 4-6 4-6 6-1 9-7 win for Mardy Fish over Stanislav Wawrinka in the first rubber of the tie. World No.3 Federer was expected to tie it up on the indoor clay court in Fribourg, which was selected by the Swiss hosts, but Isner, best-known for his marathon match against Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon, again showed his aptitude on the slower surface. Spain fury over drugs slur After dropping the opening set, the American took the next three to close out victory in two hours 40 minutes, ending a 15-match winning streak for Federer in the Davis Cup. \u201cThe way I played today is the way I need to play in all my matches,\u201d said Isner after his surprise victory. \u201cI owe it to Jim Courier (American Davis Cup captain)  \u2013 he was on at me to hit all my shots. It\u2019s the win of my life.\u201d Fish, despite his higher ranking, was not favored against Wawrinka, but showed his fighting qualities in  a four hour 26 minute match. He played superbly in the fourth set to level the match for the loss of a single game and always looked the stronger in the 16-game decider. \u201cI lost a couple of long ones in Austin last year, and that feels so bad I just needed to win this one.\u2019 Fish told the official Davis Cup website. Wawrinka and Federer will pair up for Saturday\u2019s doubles where they will take on Mike Bryan and teenager Ryan Harrison.  Meanwhile, holders Spain took a 2-0 lead over Kazakhstan after the opening day of their first round tussle in Oviedo. With World No.2 Rafael Nadal missing the tie for the home team, it was left to Juan Carlos Ferrero and Nicolas Almagro to step up to the plate. Veteran Ferrero needed five sets to beat Mikhail Kukushkin 6-1 4-6 7-6 4-6 6-4 while Almagro eased past Andrey Golubev 6-3 4-6 6-1 6-1. "

Sharapova had beaten Kerber in straight sets on the way to the final of the Australian Open last month, but was below her best as he slumped to a 6-4 6-4 defeat in the Pierre de Coubertin indoor arena. The Russian was playing her first tournament since losing to new World No.1 Victoria Azarenka in the title match at the opening grand slam of the year. She came through her first match and will rise to No.2 in the world rankings next week, but despite breaking Kerber\u2019s service twice in the opening set lost control of the match. World No.27 Kerber broke back twice to forge a 5-4 lead and Sharapova made two unforced errors to hand her the set. Sharapova was also erratic in the second set, again giving up an early break. An backhand which flew out on match point saw Kerber clinch her first victory over a top-10 player. \u201cIt was a tough day because my opponent played really well,\u201d Sharapova told AFP.  \u201cI did have opportunities but I didn\u2019t take them today. \u201cI was up in both sets and I had breaks but she played extremely well \u2013  much better than I did, in any case. Kerbe will play either Belgian Yanina Wickmayer or German qualifier Mona Barthel for a place in the final. Czech world number 51 Klara Zakopalova  beat German sixth seed Julia Goerges 3-6 7-5 6-1 in their quarterfinal. Zakopalova will play Marion Bartoli of France after the second seed battled back to beat Italy\u2019s Roberta Vinci, 4-6, 6-4 7-6. Bartoli trailed a set and 1-4 and was down 5-2 in the decider before delighting the home crowd with victory over the seventh seed. In other WTA news, Petra Kvitova has pulled out of next week\u2019s Qatar Open with an achilles tendon injury. The Czech will lose her No.2 ranking to Sharapova on Monday, but is resting after a hectic January which saw her win the Hopman Cup in Perth with compatriot Tomas Berdych. She made the semifinals in Sydney and the Australian Open before helping her country into the semifinals of the Fed Cup World Group.  "

Arid Uka, a 22-year-old ethnic Albanian from Kosovo who went on a shooting rampage in March of last year, was charged with two counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder and serious bodily harm. After 11 days of court proceedings, the Frankfurt Higher Regional Court ruled that \u201con March 2, 2011, the perpetrator \u2013 who was born in Kosovo, grew up in Germany and had no prior convictions \u2013 executed an Islamically-motivated attack on a group of members of the U.S. Air Force. He killed two U.S. soldiers and seriously wounded two other soldiers in an attempt to kill them,\u201d according to a news release. The airmen, who were bound for Afghanistan, were caught off guard outside Frankfurt International Airport when Uka began firing at them while they boarded a shuttle to Ramstein air base. Two U.S. airmen were shot dead and others injured before Uka\u2019s 9 mm pistol jammed. Because of the especially \u201csevere nature\u201d of his crimes, the court denied Uka eligibility for bail in 15 years, as is otherwise customary in Germany."

It left the former winners on 13-under-par 131, one clear of overnight leader Rafael Cabrera-Bello of Spain, who carded a 69. World No.4 Martin Kaymer of Germany was in a three-strong group on 11-under, boosted by his first-ever hole in one. His eight-iron tee shot to the 186-yard seventh found the cup on his way to a 67.  \u201cNow I\u2019m part of the hole in one family,\u201d he told the European Tour official website. Scotland\u2019s Scott Jamieson and Frenchman Gregory Bourdy joined him on that mark, while World No.3 Lee Westwood moved up with a 65 for 10-under 134 to boost his challenge. U.S. Open champion McIlroy, out early after his first round 66, was again in imperious form as he reached the turn in four-under 33, having started on the 10th. Watched by his girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki, the Northern Ireland star also missed an eagle chance from under 10 feet at the 18th and a short birdie putt on the first. But with seven birdies and no dropped shots he left himself well-placed to repeat his 2009 success in Dubai. \u201cI just kept picking up birdies along the way and it puts me in a great position,\u201d he said \u201cI feel a lot more confident than I did in Abu Dhabi. \u201c Bjorn, who held off Tiger Woods to win the Dubai title in 2001, also carded seven birdies and said he was not overawed by the presence of McIlroy, Westwood and Kaymer at the top of the leaderboard. It\u2019s very easy to get impressed by the way they play the game, but you\u2019ve got to go out and focus on your own game,\u201d he said. Abu Dhabi winner Robert Rock followed his opening 73 with a five-under 67 to stand four-under with defending champion Alvaro Quiros, Colin Montgomerie and Tom Lewis. Last weekend\u2019s Qatar Masters champion Paul Lawrie was a shot further back.

        "content": "Europe remained gripped by frigid temperatures and snow Friday, with the icy weather closing much of the Danube River to shipping and disrupting travel across the region.  Central and Eastern Europe have borne the brunt of the unseasonably bitter weather, which has led to hundreds of deaths and thousands of cases of frostbite and hypothermia. Twenty-two countries have posted warnings for extreme cold temperatures and accumulating snow, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. The big freeze is not likely to end any time soon, Miller said, with the Arctic air forecast to continue spilling deep into Europe, keeping temperatures well below average and allowing the snow to continue to pile higher and higher.  In Ukraine, the worst-affected country, well over 100 people have died and more than 3,000 have sought hospital treatment.  State news agency Ukrinform said more than 120 ships \u2013 most of them foreign \u2013 were trapped in the Kerch Strait, linking the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea, because of ice. Parts of the Danube River, one of the most important rivers in Europe for commerce, have nearly frozen over for the first time in 25 years. That has led at least four countries to halt shipping along sections of the 1,700-mile-long waterway because of the risk of damage to vessels\u2019 hulls. The river is also used for drinking water, irrigation and tourism. The stretch of the Danube running through Romania has been closed indefinitely to traffic, Romanian state television network TVR reported Friday. However, most roads had reopened as of late Thursday, TVR reported, although major problems remain on the country\u2019s rail network. Romania\u2019s capital, Bucharest, reached a low of -24 degrees C for the second morning running Friday, its lowest temperature since the cold snap began two weeks ago. Bucharest has not seen the mercury climb above the 0 degree Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) freezing point since January 24, Miller said. The average high for this time of year is 3 degrees Celsius (37 degrees Fahrenheit). Snow is lying 11 inches deep in Bucharest but has piled up even higher to the west, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the capital, Sarajevo, has seen over 39 inches accumulate in the past two weeks, Miller said. A year ago, the city was covered by less than half an inch of snow. The Balkan Peninsula has been hammered with a series of potent snow storms, the result of a jet stream that has sagged much farther south than normal, allowing storms to pick up moisture over the waters of the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas and dump it on the already frozen landscape of the Balkans, Miller added. In Serbia, the death toll from the cold snap rose to 16 on Friday, Interior Ministry emergencies official Predrag Maric told Serbian state news agency Tanjug. The situation has improved, he is quoted as saying, since the government declared a state of emergency in 38 municipalities. Authorities are now focusing on getting food to people in the worst-affected areas, the news agency said.  Five more people died of hypothermia overnight in Poland, according to the Interior Ministry, the website of the publicly funded Polish Radio reported, taking the total number of cold related deaths there to 97. Turkish Airlines, the national flag carrier for Turkey, canceled 57 domestic and international flights Friday because of severe weather, the semiofficial Anatolian news agency reported. In a sign of the extreme weather conditions, the city hospital in Split, Croatia, has used two years\u2019 supply of plaster in only five days; a result of treating the high number of fractures caused by slips on the snowy and icy terrain, Miller said. South-east and western Europe can also expect more wintry weather over the weekend. Italy is braced Friday for heavy snowfall, with more than 40 deaths blamed on the cold snap so far, according to reports. La Repubblica newspaper said it was expected to be the most difficult weekend for more than a decade, with the icy conditions extending as far south as Calabria. Schools and offices were closed in Rome as city workers prepared to cope with as much as a foot of snow overnight. The mayor has issued an order requiring drivers to carry snow chains, and extra salt has been stockpiled for use on the roads. Heavy snowfall a week ago paralyzed roads and trains in many cities across Italy, leading to wide criticism of authorities. The number of beds available for homeless people in Rome has almost doubled, from 1,300 to 2,500, and new shelters have been set up in many metro stations, which are being kept open overnight, officials said. The Six Nations rugby match between Italy and England in Rome will go ahead Saturday as planned, English rugby union officials said. Some weather-related delays and cancellations have been reported at Italian airports. Train services have been suspended in 12 regions, the Corriere della Sera newspaper reported. The center-north regions of Emilia Romagna, Abruzzo and Marche, where it has been snowing for several days, have been particularly affected by the bad weather. Local trains are suspended.  In the northern Italian city of Trieste, an icy wind is blowing at more than 80 miles per hour and is expected to strengthen, according to the regional civil protection agency.  An alert has been issued for strong winds over the next 36 hours, as people in the city report finding it difficult to remain standing in the gusts.  The famous canals of Venice started freezing over this week, preventing gondoliers from plying their trade on the city\u2019s picturesque waterways. Many parts of England and Wales saw snow Thursday night and Friday morning. "

Both teams had already guaranteed their passage through to the knockout stages with both winning their opening two matches, but it was The Panthers who came out on top in a close encounter in Franceville.  A 62nd-minute goal from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang proved enough against an under-strength Tunisian side, who chose to rest some of their top players including skipper Karim Haggui, Khaled Korbi and Mejdi Traoui, Nevertheless, the 2004 champions proved a handful as they had the better of the opening exchanges.  But it was Gabon who came closest to scoring in the first half when Tunisia failed to clear their lines from an Aubameyang cross.  The resulting chance fell to skipper Daniel Cousin but he conspired to drag his shot wide.  Four minutes after Aubaneyang scored, Cousin was presented with another chance to score but once again his shot was off-target.  The win left him and his teammates with nothing to rue as they claimed the three points, setting up a meeting with the runners-up in Group D in Libreville next Sunday. Tunisia will face the winners of Group D.  In Group C\u2019s other match, Morocco took all three points beating Niger 1-0.

        "content": "A Norwegian court ordered Anders Behring Breivik, charged with killing 77 people last July, to undergo a month-long psychiatric evaluation as experts seek to determine his mental state ahead of a trial. Breivik is accused of killing eight people in a bomb attack in Oslo and 69 more in a gun rampage on nearby Utoya Island on July 22. It was the deadliest attack on Norwegian soil since World War II.  Two court-appointed psychiatric experts recommended that Breivik should spend four weeks under 24-hour psychiatric monitoring so the court can get the fullest possible picture of his behavior, according to court documents released Friday.  He should be kept away from other patients but will still have to interact with psychiatric staff, the documents say. The observation will be carried out in facilities at Ila Prison, where he is being held. Breivik has said he will not cooperate with the two psychiatric experts, which underlines the need for constant observation, the court documents said. The two experts were appointed last month to evaluate his mental state after the court requested a second opinion because of the importance of the question of his sanity to Breivik\u2019s trial. In November, prosecutors said psychiatrists had determined Breivik was paranoid and schizophrenic at the time of the attacks and during 13 interviews experts conducted with him afterward.  Breivik has pleaded not guilty, though he has admitted carrying out the attacks, the judge handling his case said previously. It may not be possible for him to be sentenced to the maximum punishment for the crimes if he\u2019s deemed insane. A court ruled Monday that Breivik can legally be kept in custody until his trial starts in April. Breivik reiterated some of his extremist views during Monday\u2019s hearing, which began with him entering with a smile and offering up a raised, clenched-fist salute. Breivik says nobody could believe that he was insane, and describes questions about his mental condition as ridiculous, his lawyer, Geir Lippestad, told the court.  Breivik claims the shooting rampage was a matter of self-defense, meant to save Norway from being taken over by multicultural forces and to prevent ethnic cleansing of Norwegians, Lippestad said. Authorities have described him as a right-wing Christian extremist. A 1,500-page manifesto attributed to Breivik posted on the Internet is critical of Muslim immigration and European liberalism, including Norway\u2019s Labour Party. The victims on Utoya Island were among 700 mostly young people attending a Labour Party camp on the island. Breivik\u2019s trial is scheduled to begin April 16 and is expected to last 10 weeks. "

        "content": "The former boss of the Royal Bank of Scotland, Fred Goodwin, is to be stripped of his knighthood, the British government said Tuesday, amid wide anger in Britain over bankers\u2019 bonuses. Goodwin was awarded the knighthood for \u201cservices to banking\u201d in 2004, under the previous Labour government. RBS had to be bailed out by the government in 2008 after it suffered a record loss and has since cut thousands of jobs. Goodwin, then chief executive, led the bank into the costly acquisitions that proved its downfall. After the government\u2019s multibillion-pound bailout, he retired with a huge pension deal. The decision to annul his knighthood was taken on the basis that Goodwin \u201chad brought the honours system in to disrepute,\u201d the Cabinet Office said in a written statement.  \u201cThe scale and severity of the impact of his actions as CEO of RBS made this an exceptional case,\u201d it said. Goodwin become popularly known as \u201cFred the Shred\u201d for his management style while head of RBS and was the focus of much public outrage over his handling of the crisis. It is unusual for anyone to be stripped of a knighthood, an honor conferred by Queen Elizabeth II. Previous cases include that of Jack Lyons, a prominent businessman who made extensive charitable donations but was convicted of fraud in the late 1980s, and Anthony Blunt, who lost his knighthood in 1980 after he was revealed to be a member of a spy ring. Terence Lewis forfeited his knighthood in 1993, after he was convicted of corruption in Australia. More recently, financier Allen Stanford had his knighthood rescinded by the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda, which is part of the Commonwealth, after he was investigated for fraud. The decision to strip Goodwin of his knighthood comes against a backdrop of public anger over the pay and bonus offered to current RBS chief executive Stephen Hester. He decided to waive the bonus over the weekend after coming under heavy political pressure. The British government, which has been imposing a program of public sector cuts and austerity measures, owns an 83% share in RBS. The government has injected a total of \u00a345.5 billion ($70.6 billion) of taxpayers\u2019 money into RBS since 2008, the Cabinet Office statement said. The decision to strip Goodwin of his knighthood was taken on the advice of the Forfeiture Committee, a body made up of senior civil servants, after investigations into the bank\u2019s collapse by the UK\u2019s financial watchdog and lawmakers. \u201cThey are clear that the failure of RBS played an important role in the financial crisis of 2008-9 which, together with other macroeconomic factors, triggered the worst recession in the UK since the Second World War and imposed significant direct costs on British taxpayers and businesses. Fred Goodwin was the dominant decision maker at RBS at the time,\u201d the statement said. Given the widespread concern over his decisions, he could not keep the knighthood, the committee concluded. They passed their recommendation to Prime Minister David Cameron, who then informed the queen."

Yannick Noah, the last French tennis player to win the French Open back in 1983, started it last year when he claimed that Spain\u2019s recent sporting success could only be due to doping. His remarks were quickly shot down by Rafael Nadal, the Spaniard who has won the Paris grand slam six times \u2013 a record he shares with Bjorn Borg, and may hold alone this year. Now Nadal is at the center of another row, sparked by a comedy program on French channel Canal Plus that spoofed the 25-year-old and cycling champion Alberto Contador, who was this week stripped of his 2010 Tour de France title and banned after a long-running doping saga. The Spanish government is so upset it has told its ambassador to France to send a written protest to French media, including the offending channel. And the Spanish Tennis Federation has responded by threatening a lawsuit. \u201cThe RFET will sue Canal Plus Francia for broadcasting a video which, besides inadmissible and slanderous insinuations, uses the federation\u2019s logo. The RFET will also get support from other Spanish sports federation mentioned in that video, so that there is a common judicial action,\u201d it said in a statement. The French show, called \u201cLes Guignols\u201d (the Puppets), features lifelike representations of Nadal, Contador and Spain\u2019s World Cup-winning football captain Iker Casillas among others. They are shown writing in books with syringes, and in one scene the muscular Nadal puppet fills up its car\u2019s petrol tank from its own bladder. \u201cOn this occasion, intolerable limits were crossed and the RFET cannot tolerate the lack of respect and slander toward our athletes,\u201d Spanish Tennis Federation president Jose Luis Escanuela said. Nadal, who has never failed a drug test, also expressed his displeasure in interviews with Spanish media, calling it \u201ca globalized campaign from the neighboring country.\u201d \u201cAt the end of the day it is humor,\u201d Nadal said in quotes reported by national newspaper El Pais. \u201cOne day is okay but when, from what I understand, it is done repeatedly then that is not so good because it crosses the line a bit. And it is always with the same focus. \u201cThe institutions in general have to defend us because I don\u2019t think it is  a campaign against me or a campaign against anyone. It is a campaign against Spain in general, and against Spanish sports. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is only Canal Plus that does it. I think there are other media pushing it along and I think that is something punishable because in Spain sportspeople who are not clean are punished, they don\u2019t compete.\u201d Noah\u2019s comments were made in the wake of Spain\u2019s incredible sporting achievements in recent years. Nadal was world No. 1 until last year, when he won his 10th grand slam title, having ended Roger Federer\u2019s dominance before he too was usurped by Novak Djokovic.  Contador has won the Tour de France three times, though he lost one of those titles after testing positive for a small amount of the banned steroid clenbuterol. He overturned his initial ban, but the International Cycling Union and the World Anti-Doping Agency successfully appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Casillas has led Spain\u2019s all-conquering football team to the 2008 European title and the 2010 World Cup crown, while his club Real Madrid\u2019s big rivals Barcelona have been similarly dominant."

        "content": "Top-level female football in the U.S. was dealt a severe blow on Monday when it was announced the 2012 Women\u2019s Professional Soccer (WPS) season had been suspended. The league only began in 2009, but an expensive legal dispute with a former franchise owner has driven the board of governors to halt the five-team competition. The announcement came just 24 hours after the U.S. national women\u2019s team had beaten Canada 4-0 to win the North and Central American qualifying tournament for the 2012 Olympics Games in London. \u201cWe are proud of what the league has accomplished in the first three seasons,\u201d Thomas Hofstetter, owner of the New Jersey-based Sky Blues FC, who won the 2009 WPS playoffs, said in a statement.  \u201cBut we do recognize the necessity to resolve our existing legal and operational issues so that we can continue to support and grow WPS the right way.  \u201cThis was a very difficult decision, but one we as owners feel is the best business decision for the league at this time.\u201d The legal dispute which has forced the league to take this step is with Dan Borislow, the owner of the Florida-based magicJack franchise. Borislow brought the Washington Freedom team in 2011 before relocating it to Boca Raton and renaming the franchise after his communications company. He repeatedly clashed with WPS over a number of issues, including the size of the magicJack\u2019s stadium and reportedly failing to pay player wages. WPS took the decision on October 27 2011 to \u201cterminate\u201d the franchise, which had U.S. national team stars such as goalkeeper Hope Solo and striker Abby Wambach on its roster. Borislow challenged the termination, with the league forced to suspend the 2012 season \u201cin order to address the legal issues head-on before moving forward with competition.\u201d \u201cThose that take part in our league \u2013 players, partners and fans \u2013 deserve the best,\u201d said WPS CEO Jennifer O\u2019Sullivan. \u201cThat is what we are taking the time to ensure we deliver when we resume play in 2013 and beyond. \u201cWith our supporters and athletes in mind, we are committed to complete the hard work necessary to resume play in 2013 and reestablish WPS as the premiere women\u2019s professional soccer league in the world.\u201d The 2011 WPS playoffs were won by the Western New York Flash, who were led by Brazil\u2019s five-time FIFA World Player of the Year Marta.

        "content": "Technical experts directing the salvage operation aboard the Costa Concordia cruise ship are recommending that the underwater part of the operation be called off because it is becoming too dangerous, Italy\u2019s civil protection agency said Tuesday. The head of the operation, Franco Gabrielli, will make the final decision, but is unlikely to go against the recommendations of the technical experts, his office said.  The advice is based on safety concerns and follows consultations with relatives of the people still missing from the shipwreck and diplomats representing their countries, the civil protection agency said. A total of 15 people remain missing after the cruise ship\u2019s collision with rocks off the coast of Tuscany on January 13. Seventeen bodies have been recovered. There were about 4,200 people on the cruise liner when it crashed. Franco Schettino, captain of the Costa Concordia, said that after the ship hit the rocks, he ran it aground off Giglio island to keep it from sinking and limit the tilting. It came to rest on its starboard, or right, side, with roughly 50% of the ship under water. It is currently rotated nearly 90 degrees. Salvage operations in the part of the ship above the water line will continue, Gabrielli\u2019s office said, as will searches of  7 square miles (18 square kilometers) of sea around the wreck. Underwater operations have previously been temporarily suspended for safety reasons, but have always resumed. Technical experts are now advising that they come to a permanent end.  Schettino is under house arrest on suspicion of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still on board.  He denies the charges, saying his actions saved lives. Schettino has admitted to prosecutors, defense attorneys and a judge that he made a \u201cmistake\u201d in colliding with the rocks off shore. But he has brushed aside suggestions that he was going too fast, as prosecutors allege. The lead prosecutor in the case is asking that Schettino be sent back to jail. A hearing has been scheduled for February 6. But Schettino\u2019s lawyer says he should be released from house arrest. Officials are particularly concerned for divers who are searching submerged areas of the ship amid a sea of debris that includes heavy items and wires, they said Sunday. The ship jolted slightly and then slowly moved even further, totaling about 4 centimeters over a few hours, Gabrielli said Sunday. The ship\u2019s movement renewed fears that the vessel could slide farther. Earthquakes in the region last week also stoked fears that the ship could plunge deeper into the water. Gabrielli said that if the ship does not slip into deeper water, it will take at least seven to 10 months to remove the wreckage. And that process won\u2019t begin until after the fuel is removed, which could take 28 working days once it begins. In the meantime, there will be no fishing, diving, snorkeling, or other normal use of the water near the wreckage, extending the disaster\u2019s economic toll. A number of survivors have filed lawsuits against the company that ran the cruise, Costa Cruises.  Costa has announced it was offering each of about 3,200 passengers who had been aboard the vessel a lump sum of 11,000 euros ($14,400), in compensation for their loss of property and emotional distress, as well as a refund of costs associated with the cruise. Separate agreements will be reached with those passengers who were injured and needed treatment at the scene and with the families of those who died, Costa said."

        "content": "It happens at the end of January every year \u2013 an apparently mad and desperate dash to sign players as European football\u2019s transfer window draws to an agonizing close. Club officials man the phones, fax machines at the ready to sneak registrations inside the deadline. Football agents, desperate to secure their clients a lucrative last-minute move, frantically try to negotiate contracts and transfer fees before the clock strikes midnight and the chance has disappeared. It often seems like a classic case of panic-buying, as clubs seek to bolster their squads for the second half of the season, but the last-day scramble is the culmination of weeks of negotiations between all the involved parties, says British agent Mel Stein. \u201cGenerally speaking, if somebody genuinely wants to buy a player, they will have earmarked him well before the window opens,\u201d says Stein, who represented former England stars such as Alan Shearer and Paul Gascoigne. Who are January\u2019s top transfer targets? \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a player that wants to leave and wants to join the club who wants to buy him. So you\u2019ve got to push all of those pieces together, which sometimes is a lot more difficult than it sounds.\u201d Since 2002, European clubs have only been able to add to their rosters during two transfer windows \u2013 which generally run in the offseason between July 1 and August 31 and midseason throughout the month of January. As a result, deadline day has become a biannual ritual, with fans glued to TV screens in the hope their club will pull off a shock transfer coup. Stein says the restrictions the windows have placed on clubs have added extra strain to transfer negotiations. \u201cThere will have been some sort of contact, either formal or informal, well before the window opens,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo if you date it from there to when the player actually signs, I\u2019d say you\u2019re talking about an average of three or four weeks. \u201cI\u2019ve got one or two deals that are bubbling under. People wait until the last minute and it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. These deals could have happened weeks ago and yet managers are jockeying for position, they don\u2019t get the money from the club and then the club changes its mind at the last minute.\u201d Stein says the 1992 transfer of Gascoigne, who was then 25 and in his prime, from London club Tottenham Hotspur to Rome-based Lazio was particularly difficult.  \u201cThe injuries, the financial problems Spurs were experiencing, the tax money element of it \u2013 it was a very complicated transaction, it really was,\u201d he recalls.  \u201cI lived and breathed it for months. I had an all-night session with Lazio, worked all the way through the night and didn\u2019t go to bed.\u201d European football\u2019s governing body UEFA has attempted to cut reckless spending by introducing financial fair play regulations \u2013 a set of rules which sanction clubs for spending beyond their means. Stein believes the eagerness of teams to lower their wage bills and conform to the new rules has changed how transfers are set in motion, with clubs now eager to offload high-earning stars. \u201cA couple of years ago, 95% of transfers would have been player instigated. Nowadays, with the financial restraints on clubs, I would say over 50% are club instigated,\u201d he says. \u201cI had a player who was astonished to learn that I\u2019d been phoned by a manager who was telling me that my player was available because he was fairly high on that club\u2019s wage list and they wanted to reduce their budget.\u201d This year\u2019s January window has been dominated by one player whose club want remove him from the wage bill, Manchester City\u2019s Carlos Tevez. The Argentina striker has been embroiled in a bitter dispute with the English leaders since being fined by the club for refusing to come on as a substitute during a European Champions League match with Bayern Munich in September. Tevez has been linked with Italian giants AC and Inter Milan and big-spending French outfit Paris Saint-Germain, but was looking likely to remain at City as the deadline approached.  So what would be Stein\u2019s advice to the 27-year-old, who captained City to the club\u2019s first trophy in 35 years last season and topped the team\u2019s scoring charts \u2013 but has not played for City since the incident in Germany? \u201cYou\u2019ve got Man City who want him out but don\u2019t want to lose a fortune. You\u2019ve got Tevez jogging along a beach in South America and you\u2019ve any number of people putting him around to clubs who probably can\u2019t afford him anyway,\u201d Stein says. \u201cThat is a total nightmare transaction. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s one I wouldn\u2019t like to be involved in because it would be an enormous challenge to see that one through. \u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018You\u2019re a professional footballer, you\u2019re only going to be playing until you\u2019re 35, you need to get yourself playing. This is stupid, you\u2019ve got to do something.\u2019 \u201c"

        "content": "Vertical gardens are cropping up all over cities these days, transforming drab urban facades into vibrant jungles of color.  These lush expanses have found their way onto the walls \u2013 both inside and out \u2013 on numerous sites in recent years revitalizing public buildings, hotels, offices and even a multi-storey car park in Netherlands.  Aside from their pleasing aesthetic qualities, vertical gardens could also deliver more practical benefits says Mark Laurence, creative director at Biotecture, a UK company who design and build green walls.   \u201cThe market is rapidly moving into looking at how they can provide eco-system services and green infrastructures for urban environments,\u201d Laurence said.  Their modular hydroponic system \u2013 where plants sit in a soil-free set up with nutrients delivered through irrigation channels  \u2013 can be retrofitted to just about any wall.   A recent creation erected on the side of Edgware Road Underground station in central London is hoping to improve air quality.  The 200-square meter wall near Marylebone Road \u2013 one of the UK capital\u2019s grimiest thoroughfares \u2013 is being monitored by Imperial College, London.  \u201cThey have taken initial samples and going at regular intervals to take leaf samples. Then they wash these leaf samples to see how much particulate matter has adhered to the leaves,\u201d  said Laurence. The leaves also have an electrostatic charge that also attracts particles.  \u201cA researcher I was speaking to recently reckons green walls in urban canyon environments (areas where walls are higher than the width of the road separating them) are more effective than trees at collecting particles because the way the wind eddies around and then moves down the wall,\u201d Laurence said. Some believe that in less polluted areas, green walls could be employed to grow food, which could aid urban food security.  Biotecture have successfully trialled a wall which grew 45 varieties of vegetable.       Furthermore, there\u2019s nothing stopping people building their own, more basic green walls at home, Laurence says.  There are various systems for DIY constructions with most requiring a compost-based system, he says, but homemade hydroponic systems can be made using plastic bottles. All you need is irrigation and adequate light.     "

Woods said that his ball-striking was beautiful all week but expressed surprise at how far the ball was traveling for him on Sunday.  \u201cI hit a couple of three-woods 320 (yards). That\u2019s something I don\u2019t normally do, so I\u2019ve got to figure out why the ball was going further than it should today,\u201d Woods told CNN\u2019s Shane O\u2019Donoghue. \u201cI hit a couple of eight irons a buck-eighty (180 yards). I\u2019ve got to figure that out\u2026because even with the adrenaline the ball was going further.\u201d  Woods was impressed how his playing partner and eventual winner, Robert Rock handled himself on the final day.   \u201cHe played solid,\u201d Woods said.  \u201cHe made one or two mistakes here and there but hit a couple of beautiful iron shots on the back nine and made a couple of key putts to extend the lead and that\u2019s something he never gave up,\u201d he added.   After completing his second tour victory the Englishman admitted that he was \u201cvery very nervous and very excited\u201d to play with Woods.  \u201cI didn\u2019t know how I would cope early on but I hit a decent drive down the first, so that kind of settled me into it a little bit,\u201d Rock said.  \u201cI got a couple of birdies in early on, so did Tiger, and then it became a bit of fun and I wasn\u2019t quite as nervous,\u201d he added.   \u201cI was just concerned all the way round that he, just as you expect him to do, would chip in, hole long putts, do absolutely anything.

        "content": "Spain\u2019s best-known judge, Baltasar Garzon, refused to answer questions from a prosecutor as he took the stand Tuesday in his trial on charges of abusing his judicial authority.       Garzon sat and listened in silence as lawyer Joaquin Ruiz Infante read out all his questions to put them into the court record.       The case centers on Garzon\u2019s investigation of human rights abuses under Gen. Francisco Franco, the dictator who ruled Spain for four decades, until his death in 1975.       A seven-judge panel at Spain\u2019s Supreme Court Tuesday rejected requests from both state prosecutors and Garzon\u2019s defense to throw the case out, clearing the way for private prosecutors to press forward.       Spanish law allows for private prosecutions, and it is the lawyers for these parties that are pressing the charges against Garzon.      Garzon, however, did answer questions from his defense lawyer, Gonzalo Martinez Fresneda, explaining that his investigation started in December 2006 after people came forward with complaints about those still missing from the Franco era.     Garzon testified that he searched but could not find any national census of how many people disappeared or their identities. So he decided to investigate because he considered those to be \u201cpermanent crimes\u201d which still affect their descendants, since the remains have never been found.          He said he began to see evidence that there was a \u201csystematic plan\u201d against Franco\u2019s opponents, which he said included forced disappearances, illegal detentions and assassinations.       About 20 supporters applauded the judge in a hallway of the courthouse before the trial began Tuesday, while outside, dozens more demonstrated in his favor, some holding placards with just one word: justice.       Judges began hearing the Franco-era case last week, a week after a different seven-judge panel at the same court conducted another trial against Garzon, for allegedly abusing his judicial authority in a high-profile financial corruption case known as Gurtel. That trial lasted three days and a verdict is pending.      Garzon, 56, was suspended from his post in 2010, pending these trials. If convicted, he would not go to jail but could lose his right permanently to be a judge in Spain.        Many observers said the second trial is the more important one against Garzon, who became known internationally in 1998 when he sought the extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, who was in a London hospital. Garzon accused him of the murder of Spaniards in Chile and crimes of genocide.       Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch was in the courtroom on Tuesday along with other international observers and later said, \u201cGarzon showed today that his decision to take up the investigations of the crimes of the Franco era was fully supported by international law.\u201d       \u201cBut the spectacle of a judge as a criminal defendant, having to justify his investigation into torture, killings and \u2018disappearances,\u2019 was itself an affront to principles of human rights and judicial independence,\u201d Brody added.        The private prosecution is led by a small civil servants union called Manos Limpias, or Clean Hands. It brought charges against Garzon, saying he ignored a 1977 amnesty law approved in Spanish Parliament, two years after Franco\u2019s death.       \u201cParliament unanimously approved the amnesty law. Judge Baltasar Garzon takes a stance as if they\u2019re crazy. What does he think? That he\u2019s better than them?\u201d said Miguel Bernard, leader of Manos Limpias.       Bernard denies critics\u2019 charges that his group is a tiny far-right front, but he recently told CNN he was proud to receive an honor just last month from the Francisco Franco Foundation.       Just before the trial began on Tuesday, Bernard told CNN outside the courtroom that he had heard the judges would deny the motion to stop the trial and instead proceed.         \u201cA first victory,\u201d Bernard said.       Garzon said in May 2010, at the time of his suspension from his post as investigating magistrate at the National Court, \u201cI face this calmly, with the tranquility of knowing that I am innocent of these charges.\u201d       Franco\u2019s military uprising in 1936 triggered the three-year Spanish Civil War. The war ended when Franco\u2019s forces emerged victorious over Republican and leftist fighters. Franco\u2019s dictatorship continued until his death.     Mass graves from the regime are still being unearthed, including one this week in the southern Spanish village of Gerena, said Emilio Silva, from a group called Historical Memory.      Silva said the excavations are being done with permission from the landowner, whether public or private, and with permission from local health authorities, who must ensure that the potential discovery of bones or other remains does not pose a current public health risk.      Just outside the courtroom before the proceedings began January 24, Garzon told CNN he was \u201cokay\u201d as he headed into this second trial. He talked with his lawyers and supporters, smiled broadly and appeared relaxed.       Garzon spent 22 years as an investigating magistrate at the National Court, which handles cases of terrorism and other delicate cases. He has investigated the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, the Basque terrorist group ETA, and drug traffickers.       At times in the past, Garzon has been considered a darling of the Spanish right or the Spanish left, depending on the cases he was investigating. His critics say he is too flamboyant and grandstands in front of the cameras.        Since his suspension in 2010, Garzon has been working as a legal adviser outside of Spain on human rights cases and judicial issues, including in Latin America. "

        "content": "Eastern Europe shivered Tuesday in the coldest conditions seen this winter, with below-freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall leading to deaths, frostbite and widespread travel disruption. Ukraine and Poland are among the worst affected countries, with lows in Kiev and Warsaw of -17 and -16 degrees Celsius (1 and 3 degrees Fahrenheit) respectively, far lower than the average for this time of year. Ukraine\u2019s Emergency Situations Ministry said 30 people have died as a result of the cold since Friday. Twenty-one of the dead were homeless people, whose bodies were discovered on the streets, the ministry said, and four died in their homes. The ministry said more than 600 people had sought treatment for frostbite and hypothermia over the past five days, with more than 500 of those treated in the hospital. Thousands of people have sought refuge at government-run shelters as the temperatures have plummeted. About 1,590 heated tents operating across the country are offering warmth, tea and hot meals to those in need, officials said. Another 150 are due to be set up shortly. Meanwhile, schools and colleges in Kiev have canceled classes until Monday because of the cold, city authorities said. In Poland, the interior ministry urged people to look out for the elderly and homeless, saying temperatures were set to drop further as the week goes on, especially at night. CNN meteorologist Mari Ramos said Romania and Bulgaria were among the first Eastern European nations to be affected by cold and heavy snow. Tuesday morning saw lows of -22 degrees Celsius (-7 degrees Fahrenheit) in the Romanian capital, Bucharest, and -21 degrees Celsius (-5 degrees Fahrenheit ) in Moscow, compared with an average for the time of year of -3 degrees Celsius (25 degrees Fahrenheit) and -12 degrees Celsius (10 degrees Fahrenheit) respectively.  Those temperatures will feel even lower thanks to the wind. For example, the current temperature in Berlin is -6 degrees Celsius (21 degrees Fahrenheit) but feels like -14 degrees Celsius (6 degrees Fahrenheit) to the exposed skin, Ramos said, and hypothermia and frostbite can occur within just a few minutes if people are not properly dressed and protected.  In Slovakia, a 63-year-old man was found dead outside his house in the northern village of Sunava on Monday, the Slovak news agency SITA  reported, saying temperatures in the region had dropped to -24 degrees Celsius (-11 degrees Fahrenheit). In Serbia, one person has died and two are missing after heavy snowfall in the territory of Uzice, according to the state-run Serbian news agency Tanjug. Travel and electricity supplies have been disrupted, and a state of emergency has been declared in a number of districts. State-owned Bulgarian National Radio said a record low of -29 degrees Celsius (-20 degrees Fahrenheit) had been reached in the northern town of Knezha early Tuesday. Turkey was bearing the brunt of the snowfall as of Tuesday, with Greece, Albania, Macedonia also seeing heavy snow and below-freezing temperatures. In Istanbul, all non-essential employees working for the city were given administrative leave, Turkey\u2019s semi-official Anatolian news agency reported. The snow is expected to continue through Thursday. Very low temperatures are reported across Turkey, with heavy snow also expected in areas east of Marmara, central and eastern Black Sea coastal areas, the eastern Mediterranean coast and the east and southeastern parts of the country.  More than 780 villages nationwide have been cut off by heavy snow, Anatolian said. Major highways have also been affected, and much of the country is under a bad weather warning. Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk International airport reopened Monday after snow caused the cancellation of more than 200 Turkish Airlines flights, some to international destinations. The frigid air is set to move west across Europe and will stay in place through the end of the week, Ramos said, with heavy snowfall forecast for Tuscany and central Italy.  Twenty-three administrative areas in central and southern France have advisories due to snow and cold, while Paris will struggle to climb above freezing for its daytime highs for most of this week. Temperatures in London will also hover near freezing, but while a few snowflakes dusted the city Tuesday, no significant snowfall is expected, Ramos said. "

Mikael Davud, Shawan Sadek Saeed Bujak Bujak and David Jakobsen were convicted in connection with a plot to carry out explosions at offices of the Jyllands-Posten newspaper.  Davud and Bujak were convicted of terror charges, while Jakobsen was convicted of a lesser explosives charge. Davud, a Norwegian citizen of Uyghur origin, was sentenced to seven years in prison. Bujak, an Iraqi-Kurdish man with Norwegian residency, was sentenced to three and a half years in prison, and Jakobsen, originally from Uzbekistan, was sentenced to four months in prison.

Authorities also accused Davud and Bujak of plotting to shoot cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, who drew an image of the Muslim prophet Mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban that was published in Jyllands-Posten in 2005.  The controversy grew in early 2006 when a Norwegian newspaper reprinted the drawings. Islamic law generally bans any depiction of Mohammed. Norwegian authorities have said Davud, Bujak and Jakobsen were suspected of having connections to al Qaeda. In July 2010, Norwegian officials said Davud, Bujak and Jakobsen were arrested in connection with an ongoing investigation into terrorist plots in New York and the United Kingdom. "

        "content": "Romania\u2019s former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase was sentenced Monday to two years of prison in a corruption case after more than 1,000 days of trial and over 900 witnesses.  Romania\u2019s Supreme Court found Nastase guilty of illegally raising 1.6 million euros ($2.1 million) during his 2004 election campaign, when he ran for president on behalf of the Social Democrat Party.  It is the first prison sentence for a Romanian prime minister since the fall of communism. The case, nicknamed \u201cThe Quality Trophy,\u201d refers to a conference organized by a state construction agency in 2004, where companies and institutions donated money that was later used by Nastase to fund his campaign, according to prosecutors.  The trial started in January 2009, after Nastase was accused of using his political influence as a party leader in his own interest.  Nastase, who was defeated in 2004 by Traian Basescu, said Monday he was innocent.  \u201cThe trial was a political one. Everything started during the electoral campaign in 2004. The winner is now taking revenge on the loser,\u201d Nastase said.   Five other people were charged in this case and received up to seven-year prison sentences.  Nastase, who was Romania\u2019s premier from 2000 to 2004 and remains an important figure in the opposition coalition, announced he will appeal the decision.   This is not the first corruption case involving Nastase. The Social Democrat leader was accused of paying a $400,000 bribe to the former head of the country\u2019s anti-money laundering agency to delete some documents related to his wife\u2019s bank account.  The case, called \u201cAunt Tamara,\u201d refers to Nastase\u2019s claim that the money his wife had in the bank account belonged to her Aunt Tamara, who sold some jewelry and expensive paintings. Nastase was found innocent in that case.   Nastase\u2019s sentence follows more than two weeks of anti-government protests in Romania. Besides the austerity measures taken by the government over the last two years, some of the people who took to the streets were protesting against Romania\u2019s allegedly corrupt government and its politicians.  The European Union has repeatedly called on Romania to put more effort into tackling corruption and enacting judicial reform. The country was blocked last year from joining the European Union\u2019s Schengen passport-free area as northern European countries expressed their concerns about Romania\u2019s level of corruption.

The Melbourne final was the longest ever played in one of tennis\u2019 four grand slams, as Djokovic claimed his fifth major crown and third in Melbourne with a 5-7 6-4 6-2 6-7 7-5 win in five hours and 53 minutes. When asked if this was his greatest win, the Serbian \u2013 who has beaten Nadal in the last three grand slam finals \u2013 told reporters: \u201cYes. Right now, yes. \u201cThis one I think comes out on the top because we played almost six hours \u2026 I think it\u2019s probably the longest finals in the history of all grand slams, and just to hear that fact is making me cry.

Djokovic can match that if he wins the French Open for the first time in June, though his quadruple slam would be in a non-calendar year.  The 24-year-old hopes to improve his performance at Roland Garros, where last year he was beaten in the semifinals by 16-time major winner Roger Federer to end a 43-match winning run. \u201cI\u2019m prioritizing grand slams this year, as every year, and the Olympic Games,\u201d the 24-year-old said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of my highest goals. \u201cSo I want to do well and I want to get the first final at least in Paris.  I have never been in finals there, and I have a feeling that I\u2019m ready this year to achieve that.\u201d Djokovic has now won seven successive finals against Nadal, including Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, but he gave due credit to the 2009 Australian Open champion after their marathon match. \u201cUnfortunately there had to only be one winner because we both gave it all.  We both put 100% of our abilities on the court and played to the last moment,\u201d he said.  \u201cThere couldn\u2019t be two winners, but he definitely deserved to be a winner as well. I would be saying same thing if I was sitting here as a loser.\u201d After an intensive fortnight of competition, Djokovic said he planned to ban his friends from talking to him about tennis. \u201cPlease, yes,\u201d he joked when asked he was going to take a break from the game.  \u201cI\u2019m going to definitely try to get that message to them.\u201d"

In their first meeting since the Luis Suarez/Patrice Evra race row erupted in October  last year, it was Liverpool who gained the early advantage as Daniel Agger headed home from a corner in the 21st minute. But United, who dominated possession in the first half, were back on level terms before the break as Park Ji-sung fired low past Jose Reina in the 39th minute.  A scrappy second half ensued with neither side looking likely to score before Kuyt latched on to a flick from Andy Carroll to drill home an 88th-minute winner in front of a delirious Kop. The result capped a fine week for the Merseyside club as they eliminated both the blue and red sides of Manchester from English football\u2019s domestic cup competitions.  Chelsea kept their hopes of winning a seventh FA Cup alive with a 1-0 win at local rivals Queens Park Rangers \u2013 a Juan Mata penalty in the 62nd minute proving decisive.  In the other all-Premier League ties, Bolton Wanderers came from behind to beat Swansea City 2-1 at the Reebok Stadium.

        "content": "Police in England arrested a man Saturday on suspicion of making a racially abusive gesture at a high-profile soccer match between Liverpool and Manchester United earlier that day, they said Sunday. Charlotte Spink, a press officer for Merseyside police in Liverpool, said the suspect was a 59-year-old from north Wales. She did not name him. He has not been charged. Police earlier said hate crimes officers were involved in the investigation. They appealed to the public to help identify a man who appeared to be making a racist gesture and said Liverpool Football Club was cooperating with the probe. It was the first time Liverpool had played Manchester United since Liverpool\u2019s Luis Suarez was suspended and fined for racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra in October. Suarez was suspended for eight matches and fined  \u00a340,000 ($63,000), England\u2019s Football Association announced in December. Evra said Suarez repeatedly shouted a racial slur at him during the October 15 match and demanded that Suarez be held accountable. Liverpool issued a statement saying it was \u201cvery surprised and disappointed\u201d with the decision. Suarez did not specify what he said but said it wasn\u2019t offensive. \u201cI didn\u2019t insult him. It was only a form of expressing myself. I called him something his own teammates from Manchester call him,\u201d Suarez said, according to the Uruguayan newspaper El Pais. Suarez is from Uruguay. Evra was born in Senegal and plays international soccer for France. The commission found that Suarez \u201cused insulting words towards Mr. Evra\u201d and that those words \u201cincluded a reference to Mr. Evra\u2019s color,\u201d the FA statement said. Saturday\u2019s arrest is the second time this month that a person at a Liverpool match has been accused of racism Earlier this month, Merseyside police arrested a 20-year-old man on \u201csuspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offense\u201d following a Liverpool match against Oldham. The team made a public apology after Oldham defender Tom Adeyemi complained of being abused by Liverpool fans during a January 7 match. \u201cAll of us are deeply sorry for what happened on Friday night and players and our club pass on our sincere regrets to Tom Adeyemi for the upset and distress he suffered as a result of the matter at hand,\u201d the club said in a statement on its website. Liverpool is not the only top-flight English soccer team to face allegations of racism. Chelsea\u2019s John Terry \u2013 who is also captain of the England team \u2013 has been charged by police for allegedly racially abusing Queens Park Rangers player Anton Ferdinand, and will face a court case in February."

The airline said its last flight had landed at 10 p.m. Friday. \u201cBecause of a lack of visible financing in the next couple of months, the company has chosen to cease the operation of its flights as a prudent and secure measure, and it will now take all legal pertinent measures,\u201d Spanair said in a statement. \u201cThe management of Spanair is sorry and apologizes to all those who are affected by this situation.\u201d A spokeswoman at Madrid\u2019s Barajas Airport said there were not large numbers of stranded passengers there, and that other airlines have been able to get passengers on to other flights. A spokesman for Barcelona\u2019s El Prat airport said about 20 Spanair planes were sitting on the tarmac at the old terminal. Normally there would have been 27 outbound Spanair flights from the airport Saturday, and passengers on 15 of them have been able to get other flights with other companies, the spokesman said. The airport has received 105 complaints from passengers wanting their money back, he said. A special area has been set up at the airport where Spanair passengers have been able to get help but they have not been gathering in large numbers, he said.

        "content": "Four current and former employees of Britain\u2019s Sun newspaper were arrested by authorities investigating claims of inappropriate payments to police, News Corp. and police said Saturday. Police searched the men\u2019s homes as well as the East London offices of News International, the News Corp. subsidiary that publishes the Sun and other U.K. newspapers, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service said. A 29-year-old police officer was also arrested Saturday at the central London police station where he works, police said, on suspicion of corruption, misconduct in a public office and conspiracy in relation to both offenses. He works for the force\u2019s Territorial Policing command. Three of the men were arrested at their homes \u2013 two of them, aged 49 and 57, in the county of Essex, and one aged 48 in London. A fourth, aged 42, was arrested at an east London police station. By late Saturday, police said that all five men were subsequently released after posting bail. The current and past newspaper employees were all set to \u201creturn pending further inquiries\u201d in April or May, according to the Scotland Yard statement. Earlier, they\u2019d been questioned on suspicion of corruption, aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office, and conspiracy in relation to those offenses. The operation \u201crelates to suspected payments to police officers and is not about seeking journalists to reveal confidential sources in relation to information that has been obtained legitimately,\u201d an earlier police statement said. News Corp. said it is cooperating with the search of its News International offices. Police said the operation was the result of information provided to police by News Corporation\u2019s Management and Standards Committee (MSC), which was set up to look into conduct at News International, a subsidiary of News Corp. The News Corp. statement said the company had \u201cmade a commitment last summer that unacceptable news gathering practices by individuals in the past would not be repeated.\u201d The committee was asked \u201cto proactively co-operate with law enforcement and other authorities if potentially relevant information arose at those titles. As a result of that review, which is ongoing, the MSC provided information to the Elveden investigation which led to today\u2019s arrests.\u201d The Sun, which is Britain\u2019s best-selling tabloid newspaper, was the sister paper of News International\u2019s now-defunct Sunday title, the News of the World. A spokeswoman for News International earlier declined to comment on the search of its offices. The investigation into alleged corruption, known as Operation Elveden, is being run in conjunction with an inquiry into phone hacking prompted by allegations of wrongdoing at News of the World. The best-selling News of the World tabloid was shuttered in July amid outrage over claims that its staff hacked the voicemail of a missing 13-year-old girl who turned out to have been murdered. James Murdoch, chief executive of News International and the son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, has insisted that the practice of phone hacking was not widespread. News Group Newspapers, a subsidiary of News International that was the publisher of News of the World, agreed to payouts in the High Court totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars earlier this month over phone hacking claims. Among those who read statements in court were Labour Party lawmaker Chris Bryant, former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, actor Jude Law, the actor\u2019s ex-wife Sadie Frost, and high-profile rugby player Gavin Henson. News International said the company \u201cmade no admission as part of these settlements that directors or senior employees knew about the wrongdoing by NGN or sought to conceal it. However, for the purpose of reaching these settlements only, NGN agreed that the damages to be paid to claimants should be assessed as if this was the case.\u201d Both James and Rupert Murdoch, as well as senior executives at News International, have testified before British lawmakers examining allegations of wrongdoing. A public inquiry has also been set up to look at claims of widespread misconduct by the British media. Representatives of a range of news outlets have appeared before it.  There have been 13 arrests in connection with Operation Elveden and 17 in relation to Operation Weeting, the phone hacking inquiry, the Metropolitan Police confirmed. Three people have been arrested in connection with both investigations. Operation Elveden is overseen by the British police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission."

        "content": "A woman\u2019s body was found Saturday in the wrecked Costa Concordia cruise ship, Italian officials said, taking the number of people confirmed dead to 17. Rescuers have been searching the site since the massive liner struck rocks and rolled onto its side in shallow waters off an island on Italy\u2019s Tuscan coast on January 13, leading to a panicked overnight evacuation. Fifteen people remain missing. Efforts to remove 2,400 tons of fuel from the liner\u2019s tanks have been postponed until at least Tuesday because of bad weather conditions, Italy\u2019s civil protection agency said. The operation had been expected to begin Saturday or Sunday. Francesca Maffini, a spokeswoman for the civil protection agency, said Saturday that 15 of the bodies found had been identified. The latest woman to be found was wearing a uniform, she said, suggesting she may have been a member of the ship\u2019s 1,000-strong crew. The discovery of the 17th body came a day after a handful of surviving passengers of the wrecked Costa Concordia cruise ship filed a lawsuit against the cruise line. Earlier, Costa had announced it was offering each of about 3,200 passengers who\u2019d been aboard the vessel a lump sum of 11,000 euros ($14,400), in compensation for their loss of property and emotional distress, as well as a refund of costs associated with the cruise. Separate agreements will be reached with those passengers who were injured and needed treatment at the scene and with the families of those who died, Costa said. The offer was announced following a meeting between Costa Cruises and consumer groups. The lawsuit filed Friday asked for a jury trial and sought retribution from Costa Cruises, its parent company Carnival Cruise Lines and two \u201cJohn Does.\u201d The suit was filed in a court in southern Florida, where Carnival is headquartered. It faults the cruise ship operators on several counts, including \u201cmaritime negligence,\u201d \u201cgross negligence,\u201d \u201cintentional infliction of emotional distress\u201d and \u201cnegligent retention.\u201d Marc Bern, a senior partner with the New York-based law firm Napoli Bern Ripka Shkolnik that is among those behind the complaint, told CNN that his firm represents \u201chundreds\u201d of passengers who were aboard the ship. He suggested that many of them could soon join his lawsuit\u2019s six named plaintiffs.  The lawsuit filed Friday states the plaintiffs first contacted Italian consumer law group Codacons, which led to the creation of \u201can international legal collaboration \u2026 to vigorously advocate for passengers\u2019 rights.\u201d The lawsuit requests \u201ceconomic and compensatory damages in excess of $10 million for the six named plaintiffs (and) punitive damages, in an amount of at least $450 million.\u201d This is not the only legal action in this case, including in the United States. Peruvian crew member Gary Lobaton filed a lawsuit, for one, on Thursday in an Illinois court, his lawyer Monica Kelly of Ribbeck Law told CNN by e-mail. Stating that she\u2019s never met those behind Friday\u2019s lawsuit, Kelly said \u201cwe will add more (plaintiffs) in the coming week.\u201d Bern, the New York lawyer tied to the lawsuit filed in Florida, called the compensation offer \u201can insult.\u201d Jesus Garcia Heredia, who was on the cruise with his wife, told CNN Friday that he would not accept the payout. \u201cIf we can reach an agreement, I am willing to agree not to sue, no problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not for 11,000 euros. I don\u2019t accept this.\u201d Heredia said he had not yet been contacted by anyone in the company to talk about compensation. \u201cThere was a lot of loss that day,\u201d he said, referring to personal belongings and the emotional toll of the disaster. \u201cWe had it really bad there.\u201d Another passenger, Mark Plath, said he also wants to be compensated for the $6,000 worth of possessions he still has on the ship. He would like further compensation because he and his wife, Sarah, swam to shore. \u201cAlso, I helped people quite a bit, to calm down on the boat, as well as leading them to shore and to cars awaiting above, quite a while later. My wife assisted a lady with blood all over her face (my wife is a nurse),\u201d Plath wrote in an e-mail to CNN. \u201cI am not a fan of class-action lawsuits, but I think that Costa needs to take individual experiences and actions into account.\u201d Meanwhile, the captain of the Costa Concordia, Francesco Schettino, is under house arrest and faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship. Schettino has admitted to prosecutors, defense attorneys and a judge that he made a \u201cmistake\u201d in colliding with the rocks off shore. But he has brushed aside suggestions that he was going too fast, as prosecutors allege. Schettino said he ran the ship aground off Giglio island to keep it from sinking and limit the tilting. "

        "content": "The German government wants Greece to cede sovereignty over tax and spending decisions to a eurozone \u201cbudget commissioner\u201d to secure a second \u20ac130bn bail-out, according to a copy of the proposal obtained by the Financial Times. In what would amount to an extraordinary extension of European Union control over a member state, the new commissioner would have the power to veto budget decisions taken by the Greek government if they were not in line with targets set by international lenders. The new administrator, appointed by other eurozone finance ministers, would take responsibility for overseeing \u201call major blocks of expenditure\u201d by the Greek government. \u201cBudget consolidation has to be put under a strict steering and control system,\u201d the proposal reads. \u201cGiven the disappointing compliance so far, Greece has to accept shifting budgetary sovereignty to the European level for a certain period of time.\u201d Athens would also be forced to adopt a law permanently committing state revenues to debt service \u201cfirst and foremost\u201d. The German plan, circulated on Friday afternoon to finance ministry officials from eurozone countries who make up the so-called \u201ceuro working group\u201d, underscores the depths of mistrust between Greece and its European Union lenders. Despite the appointment of economist Lucas Papademos as technocratic prime minister in November, attitudes towards Greece within the EU have continued to worsen. European officials privately say that there has been little movement on public sector reforms under Mr Papademos. A senior Greek finance ministry official said Athens was unaware of the proposal and could not comment. A German finance ministry spokesman declined to comment.  Greek voters have already expressed anger about EU attempts to assist in implementing reforms. Horst Reichenbach, the German national who heads an EU task force to assist Greece, was depicted in German military garb by leftwing Greek newspapers when he arrived last year. Under the new German plan, Athens would only be allowed to spend on the normal functioning of its government after servicing its debt. If such a law is adopted, the proposal states, financial markets and other creditors would be reassured that defaults would not occur in the future. \u201cIf a future [bail-out] tranche is not disbursed, Greece cannot threaten its lenders with a default, but will instead have to accept further cuts in primary expenditures as the only possible consequence of any non-disbursement,\u201d the document said. Even before Germany circulated its proposal, the EU and International Monetary Fund had presented a 10-page list of \u201cprior actions\u201d Athens must implement before the new bail-out is agreed. According to a copy of the document, also obtained by the FT, Greece must cut an additional 150,000 government jobs within three years. The document, dated Monday, also calls for major budget cuts in defence, healthcare and \u201centity closures\u201d to bring down this year\u2019s budget deficit. The document said the preliminary estimate for the 2012 deficit target is about 1 per cent of economic output \u2013 implying swinging cuts, since previous estimates by lenders put this year\u2019s budget deficit at 7 per cent. Negotiations between Athens and EU-IMF officials this week have been stormy. On Friday, talks broke up without a deal on two elements of the EU-IMF plan: a request that Greece\u2019s \u20ac750 monthly minimum wage be reduced, as well as elimination of the two-month salary bonus granted to private sector workers as an annual bonus. George Koutroumanis, the labour minister, instead backed a joint counterproposal by employers and trade unions for a three-year wage freeze, arguing wage cuts would plunge Greece into a deeper recession.

The pair signed a long-term agreement on the future of Afghanistan, as they met at Cameron\u2019s official country residence, Chequers. \u201cThe United Kingdom and Afghanistan have a strong relationship and the two countries have been working together to create a strong and stable Afghanistan,\u201d Cameron said. Cameron said British combat forces would remain in Afghanistan well into 2014, when NATO\u2019s International Security and Assistance Force, or ISAF, is due to hand over security to Afghan forces and withdraw. Britain has about 9,500 troops in Afghanistan, making it the second-biggest contributor to ISAF after the United States, which has about 90,000 troops there.  Cameron said the NATO partners in Afghanistan would be working together to withdraw their troops in 2014 as planned. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see some cliff edge on our departure,\u201d he said. Karzai said the British prime minister had long been a friend of Afghanistan, adding: \u201cBased on that long-term relationship, we hope to provide a fundamentally strong, democratic state and a better, more secure region.\u201d Karzai\u2019s U.K. visit comes a day after a British soldier was shot dead while on foot patrol in Afghanistan\u2019s Helmand province and follows stops in Italy and France.  After meeting with Karzai in Paris Friday, French President Nicolas Sarkozy announced that France would be pulling all of its combat troops out of Afghanistan in 2013, a year ahead of schedule. His decision follows the death on January 20 of four French soldiers shot dead at their military base by a member of the Afghan National Army. Sarkozy, who faces a re-election battle this spring, said then he was suspending French training operations and combat help as a result of the attack, which injured 15 others. He paid tribute to the four soldiers at a memorial service Wednesday, speaking of the \u201cimmense loss\u201d the country had suffered.  The attack in eastern Afghanistan followed a similar shooting in December by an Afghan soldier that killed two French soldiers serving in an engineers\u2019 regiment. Speaking alongside Sarkozy in Paris, Karzai said: \u201cIt is right that Afghanistan has to provide for its own security and for the protection of its own people, and for the provision of law and order \u2013 towards which France and other allied countries have helped Afghanistan considerably in the past 10 years. \u201cAfghanistan because of that help is now ready to take more and more responsibility.\u201d U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Friday that France\u2019s decision to withdraw its forces early \u201cwas not precipitous\u201d and had been worked through with its ISAF partners and the Afghan authorities. \u201cThis was a national decision of France. It was done in a managed way. We will all work with it. As the president has said with regard to our own presence, we are working on 2014. The alliance as a whole is working on 2014, but we are also going to work within this French decision,\u201d she told reporters. France, which has been involved in Afghanistan since July 2003, has 3,935 troops there now, according to ISAF."

        "content": "Portugal signed an agreement to grant $2 billion in aid to Madeira to enable it to meet its social and financial obligations, the island\u2019s officials announced. The Lisbon-based government will transfer the 1.5 billion euros until 2031, said Alberto Joao Jardim, the president of the Madeira regional government.  In return, the leader said, Madeira will put in motion a set of austerity measures similar to those imposed on Portugal in May when the country agreed to a bailout sponsored by the various world bodies, including the International Monetary Fund.  The archipelago will have 15 years to pay off the loan starting in 2016, Jardim said Friday.   Jardim, who has been in power since 1978, stated that without the loan, the island\u2019s \u201cfuture would be compromised.\u201d  He hinted that its \u201cpolitical autonomy\u201d was in jeopardy if an agreement with Lisbon had not been reached.  In recent weeks, the government had been unable to pay medical bills covered by the local health system and was in danger of default. The local government hopes to collect about $140 million in extra revenue this year, which means the bulk of the effort to pay back the aid will come from taxpayers. The archipelago of Madeira is in the Atlantic Ocean and includes the islands of Madeira, Porto Santo and Desertas. It has a population of more than 267,000, and according to the European statistics agency.  "

        "content": "Deep down on the bottom of the Baltic Sea, Swedish treasure hunters think they have made the find of a lifetime.  The problem is, they\u2019re not exactly sure what it is they\u2019ve uncovered. Out searching for shipwrecks at a secret location between Sweden and Finland, the deep-sea salvage company Ocean Explorer captured an incredible image more than 80 meters below the water\u2019s surface. At first glance, team leader and commercial diver Peter Lindberg joked that his crew had just discovered an unidentified flying object, or UFO. \u201cI have been doing this for nearly 20 years so I have a seen a few objects on the bottom, but nothing like this,\u201d said Lindberg. \u201cWe had been out for nine days and we were quite tired and we were on our way home, but we made a final run with a sonar fish and suddenly this thing turned up,\u201d he continued. Using side-scan sonar, the team found a 60-meter diameter cylinder-shaped object, with a rigid tail 400 meters long. The imaging technique involves pulling a sonar \u201ctowfish\u201d \u2013 that essentially looks sideways underwater - behind a boat, where it creates sound echoes to map the sea floor below.  On another pass over the object, the sonar showed a second disc-like shape 200 meters away. See also: Quest for Sir Francis Drake\u2019s remains Lindberg\u2019s team believe they are too big to have fallen off a ship or be part of a wreck, but it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what could be down there.  \u201cWe\u2019ve heard lots of different kinds of explanations, from George Lucas\u2019s spaceship \u2013 the Millennium Falcon \u2013 to \u2018it\u2019s some kind of plug to the inner world,\u2019 like it should be hell down there or something. \u201cBut we won\u2019t know until we have been down there,\u201d said Lindberg. The Head of Archaeology at Sweden\u2019s Maritime Museums, Andreas Olsson, admits he\u2019s intrigued by the picture, but remains sceptical about what it could be.  The reliability of one-side scan sonar images is one of his main concerns, making it difficult to determine if the object is a natural geological formation or something different altogether.  \u201cIt all depends on the circumstances when you actually tow the [sonar] fish after the boat,\u201d he said. See also: World\u2019s oldest warship gets facelift \u201cWhat are the temperature conditions, the wave conditions, how deep is your fish in relation to the sea bed etcetera and all those parameters also affects what kind of image you have in the end,\u201d he explained. Even Lindberg agrees the image \u201cisn\u2019t the best it could be.\u201d But his crew are still planning to return to the site in the calmer waters of spring to investigate their find. It\u2019s a risky and expensive business, and not one that always pays off. British maritime historian, Professor Andrew Lambert, says the costs of recovery are now too high for most. \u201cIf you want to stand in a cold shower tearing up \u00a350 notes, go shipwreck hunting,\u201d he said. \u201cMost shipwrecks are rotting away, or carrying dull things \u2013 all the romance has been taken out of it.\u201d It\u2019s a problem Lindberg and his team are aware of. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult industry to be in \u2013 it\u2019s money all the time,\u201d he confessed. \u201cThe best thing it could be, would be 60 meters of gold \u2013 then I would be very happy.\u201d  \u201cThis thing is very far out, it\u2019s really off-shore, so first of all we need a bigger ship\u2026 more equipment.. and we have to do bottom sampling, water sampling, to see if it is something poisonous.\u201d But even if the mystery object doesn\u2019t contain retrievable treasure the site could still prove to be a gold mine for the Ocean Explorer team, with tourists and private investors paying to see it up-close, in a submarine. See also: How to survive a shipwreck \u201cThe object itself is maybe not valuable in the sense of money it can be very interesting whatever it is, historical or a natural anomaly,\u201d said Lindberg. In the North Atlantic, one American salvage company is also hoping to beat the odds. Odyssey Marine Exploration \u2013 a company made up of researchers, scientists, technicians and archaeologists \u2013 have at least 6,300 shipwrecks in their database that they are looking to find.  Their latest discoveries include two British war-time shipwrecks off the coast of Ireland that could be laden with hundreds of tonnes of silver. Mark Gordon, president of Odyssey, says at least 100 ships on their watch-list are known to have values in excess of $50 million dollars. \u201cWhen you think about the fact until the mid 20th century, the only way to transport wealth was on the oceans and a lot of ships were lost, it adds up to a formula where we have billions of dollars worth of interesting and valuable things on the sea floor,\u201d he said. The lure of treasure has lead to an increasing number of discoveries in recent years. But one which doesn\u2019t come without its dangers, warns Olsson.  \u201cI think recently we\u2019re entering a time of a lot of discoveries,\u201d he said of the technological advancements in finding shipwrecks. \u201cThe professional shipwreck discoverers are doing a great effort for cultural heritage management in the long run\u2026 what we don\u2019t support is the action of actually taking up items and selling them,\u201d he said."

Rafael van der Vaart\u2019s long-range strike just before halftime proved the difference but veteran goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini had to make a number of superb saves to keep the visitors in front. Tottenham were missing Gareth Bale, who scored a superb goal in their last-gasp 3-2 defeat against Manchester City last Sunday and showed little of the form that has made them title contenders in the English Premier League this season. Watford had given Tottenham some uncomfortable moments before Dutch star van der Vaart found space to unleash a shot which home goalkeeper Scott Loach might have tipped away. Luka Modric, who was below his best, was replaced by Aaron Lennon for the second half, but still Tottenham could not dominate with their usual passing game. Cudicini came to their rescue when he stretched to get the merest fingertip on youngster Sean Murray\u2019s curling shot which hit the post.  Troy Deeney fluffed the follow-up with the goal gaping.     Van der Vaart rattled the crossbar at the other end before Watford again came close as John Eustace hit the woodwork with a header from a corner. Still the home side pressed forward and Nyron Nosworthy force Cudicini into a reaction save and Kyle Walker blocked Marvyn Sordell\u2019s follow up. So relief at the end for Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp, who came to the match straight from his trial in a London court on tax evasion charges. \u201cFull credit to Watford tonight, they were superb,\u201d Redknapp told ESPN. \u201cWe were well below our best but I\u2019m pleased we have gone through.\u201d In Friday\u2019s other fourth round game, Everton had to come from behind to beat fellow English Premier League side Fulham 2-1 at Goodison Park. A goal 17 minutes from time from Everton\u2019s Belgian international midfielder  Marouane Fellaini sealed their passage to the last 16. Fulham had gone ahead through a first half penalty from Danny Murphy but Everton leveled as Argentine Denis Stracqualursi scored his first goal for the club.

It left them tied on six points and assured of a place in the last eight, while Morocco and debutants Niger are going home and are pointless with a match to play in Group C.

The 29-year-old is re-united with PSG coach Carlo Ancelotti, who was in charge at Chelsea when they won the English Premier League and FA Cup double in 2010. He had fallen out of favor under Andre Villas-Boas and was also a target for fellow EPL side Queens Park Rangers, but chose the Parisian giants.  \u201cI knew about PSG\u2019s immense stature and that made me want to come,\u201d Alex told the club\u2019s official website. \u201cFor  the past two months I\u2019ve wanted to leave Chelsea and we finally opened talks with PSG. Everything went very well.\u201d Alex has won 18 Brazil caps and was in their squad which claimed the 2007 Copa America, but he will be battling five other players, including club captain Mamadou Sakho, for places in central defense. \u201cI know him very well. He\u2019s a fantastic man and a fantastic player. He\u2019s a good investment for the team,\u201d said Ancelotti. Ancelotti, who took charge in December, also revealed that the Qatari-backed club had ruled out an immediate move for Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez. The Italian said they had been in discussions with Tevez and his connections but talks had broken down. \u201cWe discussed a move with the player but there is ultimately no agreement,\u201d Ancelotti told the club website, but left the door open for a future deal.

        "content": "They are two of Europe\u2019s premier art destinations, filled with treasures amassed over centuries. Now the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg is presenting a \u201cmini-museum\u201d inside the Prado Museum in Madrid, showcasing paintings by Velazquez, Titian and Caravaggio, as well as ancient gold artifacts from Siberia.  \u201cThe Hermitage in the Prado\u201d is the second part of an exhibition exchange \u2013 initiated as part of Spain-Russia Dual Year 2011, dedicated to promoting and strengthening the economic, political, cultural and scientific ties between the two nations \u2013 that saw the Prado exhibiting precious items from its own extensive collection in the State Hermitage Museum in February 2011.  \u201cIt was really the finest show that\u2019s ever come out of the Prado and it reflected the idea of our museum, as it were, nestling inside theirs,\u201d said Gabriele Finaldi, Deputy Director of the Prado Museum and curator of the exhibition.  Now some 180 items from the Hermitage\u2019s world-class collection are nestling inside the many galleries of the Prado, ranging from archaeological pieces all the way to modern masterpieces by Kazimir Malevich.   But, Finaldi said, this isn\u2019t a typical touring exhibition.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember that the Hermitage has not been visited by many Spaniards and it\u2019s still far away and it\u2019s still mysterious and exotic and we wanted the public to experience something of the special character of it, which is of course a palace as well as a museum,\u201d said Finaldi.  Special furniture and ornaments typical to the Hermitage, such as granite vases, were brought in to decorate the galleries to make it look more like the Russian museum, whose collection was begun by the Empress Catherine the Great.  In a statement to the press in November, Mikhail Piotrovsky, director of the Hermitage, said: \u201cWith this exhibition, we wanted to tell the story of our museum and its collection and the history of the Tsars.\u201d In addition to the objects collected by the voracious Catherine the Great are ornate Scythian gold objects from the collection of earlier Tsar, Peter the Great.  \u201cNever before has there been an exhibition like this, from and about the Hermitage, abroad,\u201d Piotrovsky continued.  Aside from both having world-class collections, Finaldi points out that they have something else in common \u2013 both have their origins as royal collections.  \u201cOne can think of Catherine the Great in Russia and Charles the Fourth here in Spain, who collected with a real passion, because they were personally interested but also because they knew it brought glory to the monarchy and to the country,\u201d said Finaldi.  \u201cThey\u2019re also the two extremes of Europe, the Hermitage at the very top end and the Prado at the bottom end, so they\u2019re the two extremes of Europe coming together, showing things that are on one level very similar and on another level, very different,\u201d he finished.

It is an anomaly that organizers of the country\u2019s new Premier League Soccer franchise hope to tackle, with their model that intends to echo the success of cricket\u2019s money-spinning IPL tournament \u2013 a shortened format of the sport featuring some of its biggest entertainers. Six former legends of the game, including ex-Arsenal and France midfielder Robert Pires and Italy\u2019s 2006 World Cup-winning captain Fabio Cannavaro, have signed up for the inaugural tournament due to start in February. The Celebrity Management Group has signed a 30-year deal with the Indian Football Association and hopes to create a new surge of popularity for soccer in one of the most densely populated countries on earth. Six teams will participate in Monday\u2019s auction in Kolkata to acquire stars of football\u2019s past. The list also includes former Spain forward Fernando Morientes, who won three European Champions League titles with Real Madrid, ex-Argentina striker Hernan Crespo, Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler and Nigeria\u2019s former World Cup star Jay-Jay Okocha. Each club will have a maximum of $2.5 million to spend in the first year, with no team allowed more than four foreign players. Each squad must also contain six under-21 Indian players. It is a concept that Bhaswar Goswami, executive director of CMG, hopes will transform the fortunes of the nation\u2019s soccer team. \u201cThe PLS has already created a huge interest among fans, players and sponsors. It\u2019s a great chance to be associated with global brands,\u201d he told CNN. According to Goswami, around 155 million Indians watched football on television in 2010, and a study in 2009 by the World Bank found that 47% of the population would describe themselves as soccer fans. But there is no question that India is cricket crazy, with revered batsman Sachin Tendulkar, known as the \u201cLittle Master,\u201d sure to trump former England and Manchester United footballer David Beckham as an icon on the sub-continent. Though Goswami denies the PLS will be similar to the IPL, there are many similarities \u2013 not least the hope that big names will add a large helping of glitz and glamor to proceedings. The annual 20-over cricket competition has proved a huge success since it launched in 2008, with the world\u2019s best players auctioned off to the nine teams, set against a backdrop of Bollywood bling. However, Goswami prefers to look elsewhere for a comparison \u2013 English football\u2019s Premier League. \u201cIf I have to benchmark myself, I will benchmark with the EPL, which is the most successful league across the world,\u201d he said. \u201cMoreover, the PLS will actually complement football in India. It will create a new market, a new audience and will produce more homegrown talent,\u201d he said. Sports analyst Harpal Singh Bedi told CNN that football was now the second most-watched sport in India behind cricket, and that the PLS could prove a game-changer. \u201cThis is a very good attempt,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are foreign players, foreign coaches and, if it is conducted like the IPL with proper planning, the PLS too can be superb.\u201d"

The figures, not seasonally adjusted, confirm Spain\u2019s jobs record as by far the worst among big eurozone economies following the collapse of the Spanish housing construction bubble from 2007.

They also say the true situation is not as bad as portrayed in the statistics, because of widespread cheating by people seeking unemployment benefits while continuing to work, especially in southern Spain. Andalusia, the big region in the south, recorded the highest unemployment rate of 31.23 per cent of the workforce, according to INE, while the Basque country in the north had the lowest rate of 12.61 per cent.

        "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/27/world/europe/pip-breast-implant-scandal-explained/index.html",
        "content": "The founder of a French company that made breast implants linked to a major health scare has been charged by police investigating the scandal. Jean-Claude Mas, former boss of Poly Implant Protheses (PIP), faces charges of involuntary injury over the now-defunct firm\u2019s use of substandard ingredients in its implants. So what is wrong with the implants? What are the risks? And what is being done to help those affected by the scandal? What is the problem? Implants made by France\u2019s Poly Implant Protheses (PIP) were banned in 2010, after it was discovered that they contained industrial-grade, which has more contaminants than the medical-grade gel they should have used. Mas is reported to have admitted authorizing the use of two gel formulas at PIP: A high-end version for wealthier clients, using American-made medical silicone, and a \u201chouse\u201d formula for everyone else. This was made from cheap industrial silicone, meant for use in mattresses, allegedly in order to cut costs and boost profits. In December 2011, authorities in France sparked a worldwide alert when they advised 30,000 French women who had been fitted with the potentially defective implants to have them removed. The implants are believed to have a higher than normal incidence of rupture, though exact figures on this differ: French authorities put the rate at 5%, but in Britain it is thought to be around 1%, in line with industry standards. California plastic surgeon Dr. Grant Stevens told CNN the health risks of industrial-grade silicone remained unclear. \u201cThe PIP industrial silicone has many contaminants,\u201d he said, but he added: \u201cWe\u2019re not sure just how many\u2026 We can\u2019t be sure what can go wrong.  \u201cWe know there\u2019s an increased incidence of inflammation; we\u2019re not certain of other health risks, but we certainly have concerns about cancer and other toxic exposures.\u201d Authorities in France and Britain have dismissed fears of cancer from the implants but have said that in case of rupture they could cause inflammation, scarring and fibrosis. Where in the world were they used? PIP was once the world\u2019s third largest supplier of implants \u2013 300,000 women in 65 countries around the world are thought to have had them fitted, both for cosmetic reasons and in reconstructive surgery following treatment for breast cancer. The implants were widely used across Europe \u2013 40,000 women in Britain are affected \u2013 and South America. PIP silicone implants were never licensed for use in the United States. British PIP implant recipient Rowena Mackintosh, told CNN she was worried about the potential impact on her health. \u201cIt\u2019s like a ticking time bomb inside me,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you go to the doctor, you don\u2019t say \u2018who makes your medicine?\u2019 \u2013 you just assume it\u2019s going to be safe. To think that I\u2019ve got mattress silicone inside me, and God knows what else they used, it\u2019s disgusting.\u201d What advice is being given to women who had the implants fitted?  The advice given to women with PIP implants has varied widely from country to country.  France has urged all of those with the implants to have them removed immediately as a precaution. In Venezuela, authorities have also recommended the precautionary removal of implants. The British government says there is no evidence to recommend the routine removal of PIP implants, though it says women who are concerned should be able to have them removed. German medical groups have recommended that women seek the removal of their implants, but that there is no immediate danger. Stevens argues that women who have had PIP implants should not wait until they rupture to have them removed. \u201cWaiting until an MRI is positive is like saying wait to run for cover until after a bomb goes off. If you know something is going to happen, you would try to remove the risk. \u201cI think it is incumbent on all women, regardless of their government\u2019s stance, to recognize that they have a flawed, defective silicone product in their chest, and they have a shell that is containing it that is also flawed \u2013 they need to remove these implants, or remove and replace them.\u201d And what is being done? The French government has offered to pay for the removal and replacement of all PIP implants fitted in France. Venezuela has said it will cover the cost of implant removal, but not their replacement. In the UK, women who had their implants paid for by the National Health Service (NHS) will be able to have them removed free of charge, after consultation with their doctor. The British government says it expects companies that fitted implants privately, for cosmetic purposes, to offer the same deal. Bioethicist Arthur Caplan told CNN it made financial and ethical sense for governments to pre-empt any potential health issues by removing the implants now, rather than waiting to see if they cause problems. \u201cIf these things do turn out to be nasty, and do cause health problems, the bill for that is going to be big, and every government that has a nationalized system is going to pay, so it may be smarter, just on prudential grounds, to take them out now, avoiding what could be a huge financial disaster down the line. \u201cOn the whole, I think it makes more sense, ethically and in terms of economic risk, to get these things out at public expense.\u201d What is the company\u2019s response? PIP went bankrupt in 2010, after its implants were banned. Its founder, Mas, is under investigation by French police. On Thursday, he was charged with involuntary injury over the implants. But PIP\u2019s lawyer, Yves Haddad, told CNN that while industrial silicone was used in its implants, no tests had shown them to be a danger \u2013 instead he insisted the problem was fear. \u201cSeveral things have heightened this fear: The advice and care given to victims, doctors who didn\u2019t want responsibility and pushed the problem onto PIP, and the intense media pressure.\u201d Haddad also says there is no money for compensation for victims. \u201cUnfortunately the company has already been liquidated. No one can expect any money to come from PIP.\u201d Will the scandal have a lasting impact? Concerns over PIP implants have led some to call for greater regulation of the plastic surgery industry. \u201cIf it\u2019s going in your body, if it\u2019s a pill, if it\u2019s a medical device, it should be regulated by the government,\u201d said Caplan. \u201cThe consumer can\u2019t tell what\u2019s safe, what isn\u2019t safe, what\u2019s made according to good manufacturing processes. \u201cI think you have to have government watching over anything that people put into their bodies for a medical or a health purpose \u2013 I don\u2019t buy the idea that it\u2019s just buyer beware.\u201d The bioethicist said the scandal also showed the need for plastic surgery charges to include insurance against problems that may arise in future. \u201cFor elective procedures\u2026 it would make sense to make part of the charge some kind of coverage or insurance if things go wrong, if there turn out to be adverse events,\u201d Caplan told CNN. \u201cNational health systems don\u2019t want to pay for purely elective cosmetic procedures, so you\u2019re going to be stuck if something does turn out to be fraudulent or just misused, and instead of turning to lawyers, it might make better sense to build some insurance into the system.\u201d"

        "content": "A crooked Somali cop may have been the one who made the kidnapping of two foreign aid workers in October possible, the safety adviser for their employer told CNN. U.S. military forces rescued Jessica Buchanan, 32, and Poul Thisted, 60, on Wednesday after they spent three months in captivity. Now in Sicily, the aid workers are to be reunited with their spouses.  Buchanan and Thisted were traveling in Somalia as workers for the Danish Refugee Council at the time of their kidnapping.  Fredrik Palsson, the group\u2019s global safety adviser, revealed new details about how the pair were captured.  Nongovernmental organizations such as Danish Refugee Council are required to have security while traveling in certain parts of Somalia. The Somali government provides protection, not private security companies, Palsson said.  Known as special protection units, these guards operate only in specific areas, and so aid workers must change vehicles and switch guards when they cross from one region to the next, he said.  \u201cWhat happened was that one of the guards, he was sold out, and he had as a mission: to capture expatriates,\u201d Palsson said. The kidnappers paid off one officer, who replaced the regular guards with others who were in on the corruption, he said.  \u201cAnd as they came close to the changeover position, then they were stopped, and then they were moved into other vehicles and they were driven away,\u201d he said.  Meanwhile, the U.S. military said that the two rescued aid workers need time out of the media spotlight to recover. The workers\u2019 health and welfare are the top priority, the military statement said, appealing to journalists to respect the privacy of the freed hostages and their families.  \u201cIt is extremely important that they have the chance to decompress from this event without the pressure of instant overwhelming public notoriety,\u201d it said. In a joint statement issued through the Danish Refugee Council, Buchanan\u2019s and Thisted\u2019s families expressed relief the two were rescued unharmed. \u201cWe are grateful for all the efforts that have been put into getting them safely back to us and for the fact that a very difficult chapter in our lives is over,\u201d it said. \u201cWe need to look ahead now, and it is going to take time for us all to adjust and to return to normal life. We would like to thank all media for having respected our needs for privacy, and we request for everyone to continue to show us this respect and to give us time and privacy, which is all we need now.\u201d The reintegration process allows the Defense Department to gather critical information while taking care of the freed captives, the military said. \u201cThe process ensures returnees have the best chance to return to their previous lives following this significant event,\u201d it said. The two hostages were freed in a dramatic overnight rescue operation. U.S. special operations forces parachuted into Somalia from airplanes early Wednesday, advanced on foot to a compound where the two kidnapped workers were being held and then freed them, U.S. officials said. The nine gunmen holding the hostages were killed, officials said.  The kidnappers seized Buchanan and Thisted on October 25 in the central Somali town of Galkayo after they visited humanitarian projects there, the Danish Refugee Council said. Neither was harmed, the aid group said. Buchanan\u2019s father, John, was to go to Sicily to see her, CNN learned. She will be returned to the United States when she wants, probably in a U.S. military aircraft. Somalia\u2019s transitional government welcomed the U.S. military operation. The rescue \u201cis a great joy to the Somali government and to all Somalis as well as to all right thinking people everywhere,\u201d the government said in a statement. \u201cHitting them hard is the only language kidnappers of innocent people, pirates and terrorists understand, and every opportunity should be taken to wipe out this scourge from our country.\u201d The new U.N. envoy to Somalia \u2013 the first permanent U.N. representative there in 17 years \u2013 also expressed understanding about the military operation. \u201cIf negotiations fail, all means must be applied, including rescue operations,\u201d Augustine Mahiga said Thursday, even as he urged that lives be protected \u201con both sides.\u201d Thisted\u2019s sister and brother-in-law wept for joy when they heard he had been rescued, the brother-in-law, Svend Rask, told Denmark\u2019s TV2. \u201cShe was overjoyed when she told us what happened,\u201d Rask said, speaking of the daughter who gave them the news. The Navy SEAL unit that killed Osama bin Laden last year in Pakistan participated in the rescue mission, a U.S. official said, without specifying whether any of the same individuals were on both assaults. The SEALs are part of the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, formerly known as SEAL Team Six. The area where the hostages were seized is known as a hub for pirates, rather than an area of Islamic militant activity.  Somalia Report, a website that tracks piracy statistics, said more than $150 million was paid out in ransoms in 2011. Successful pirate attacks on merchant vessels began to drop off in 2011 in face of improved shipping security \u2013 including on board armed security detachments \u2013 and stronger action from the foreign navies patrolling the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. The International Maritime Bureau, which tracks piracy, said the number of attacks had risen but the success rate had plummeted to 12% in the first nine months of 2011. The aid workers were part of the Danish Refugee Council\u2019s de-mining unit, which aims to make civilians safe from land mines and unexploded ordnance. Buchanan has been employed as a regional education adviser with the mine clearance unit since May; Thisted, a community safety manager with the de-mining unit, has been working in Somaliland and Somalia since June 2009."

        "content": "Tiger Woods moved into contention at the halfway stage of the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship Friday as he bids for successive tournament victories. The former World No.1 carded a second round three-under par 69 for five-under 139, two behind leader Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark. It is the first outing of the year for Woods, who rounded off 2011 with victory in the Chevron World Challenge in California. Frustrated with his putting in a first round 70, Woods rolled home birdie putts at the 11th, 12th and 15th, but bogeyed the next after driving into the rough. Blog: Why golf (and big business) still need Tiger Woods  It provoked an angry reaction, but at the end of his round the American was satisfied. \u201cI thought I played well today,\u201d he told the official European Tour website.  \u201cI feel like I\u2019m swinging well and a lot of things that Sean (coach Sean Foley) and I have been working on are starting to feel very comfortable. \u201cI\u2019ve grown to understand what he wants me to do and how my body is going to do those things and produce the numbers he wants me to produce.\u201d  Woods ended on the same mark as playing partner Rory McIlroy, who followed his opening 67 with a level par 72. The 22-year-old U.S. Open champion was penalized two shots for a rules infringement on the ninth, brought to his attention by World No.1 Luke Donald, who was the third member of the high-powered group. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking clearly and just made a very stupid mental mistake,\u201d McIlroy said about the error which cost him a share of the lead. But the big names will all have to catch 22-year-old Olesen, who carded a second round 67 to hold a one-shot lead over Gareth Maybin of Northern Ireland and Italian teenager Matteo Manassero in joint second. \u201cI hit it pretty close and holed some good putts,\u201d said World No. 171 Olesen. Meanwhile, Donald remained off the pace on one-under after a 72 and World No.2 Lee Westwood is on level par. Westwood has been struggling with a neck problem but a hat-trick of birdies made sure he will be around for the weekend. On the PGA Tour, Kyle Stanley and Spencer Levin shared the lead after the opening round of the $6 million Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines. The American pair both shot 10-under 62s on the North Course, considered easier than the South Course which is also being used for the tournament. They lead Bill Haas by a shot while Marc Turnesa had the lowest score on the South with a 66. But three-time champion Phil Mickelson had a disastrous 77, finding 11 bunkers and describing his score as \u201cpathetic.\u201d     "

        "content": "Maria Sharapova certainly means business when she steps onto a tennis court. Whatever the situation, winning or losing, there is no let-up. A big serve, blistering ground strokes, winning points often greeted with a clenched fist and shrieks of exultation. Opponents are not so much beaten as bludgeoned into submission \u2013 although at the handshake Sharapova is never less than courteous and sporting, the intensity replaced by a smile. It\u2019s a winning formula that has brought the 24-year-old Russian three grand slam titles and made her the highest-paid sportswoman in the world, with an eight-year Nike deal worth a reported $70 million. Sharapova: Serving social media or backhanded marketing?  She can return to the top of the world rankings by winning Saturday\u2019s Australian Open final, capping a remarkable comeback after injuries almost ended her career. With such a hunger for success, it\u2019s no surprise that Sharapova pays great attention to every aspect of her performance \u2013 and that extends to her on-court appearance and apparel. \u201cWhen you look good, you feel good,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cConfidence with what you\u2019re wearing is very important. If you feel good, you will always perform your best without worrying about anything.\u201d   A shrewd businesswoman off the court, Sharapova took matters into her own hands with her own range of clothing and footwear, which has developed into a successful commercial venture.  The Maria Sharapova Collection is made in collaboration with her sportswear sponsors and leading fashion house Cole Haan. First launched at the Australian Open two years ago, the design brief is to come up with a separate outfit for each grand slam. This year\u2019s offering in Melbourne is called \u201cThe Statement Slam.\u201d Sharapova has already made a big statement by beating Petra Kvitova, her conqueror in last year\u2019s Wimbledon final, to set up a title clash with Victoria Azarenka. Maybe, just maybe, the outfit played its part. The PR handout from Nike would certainly have us believe it. \u201cThe carefully-constructed vents with mesh inlays along the bodice reflect the breathable gills of a powerful shark or super-charged race car and help keep Sharapova cool and ready to attack. Contrast color in the mesh becomes a stealth weapon to distract the opponent.\u201d Whatever the hype, a great deal of work goes into the final product, with the process starting up to 18 months before it is unveiled and made available to the general public. Sharapova is intimately involved in the design process of the outfit to which she lends her name, coming up with sketches and design ideas.  \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see my collections in the store,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s even more thrilling is to see women wearing and loving the product. If I can create something that allows a woman to feel better \u2013 that is the true reward.\u201d Several young female players on the WTA Tour sport her collection in tournament play, including Sofia Arvidsson, Kai-Chen Chang, Indy De Vroome, Andrea Hlavackova, Madison Keys and Anastasia Pivovarova. In fact, her reputation for fashion sense is already legendary among the game\u2019s elite.  When Rafael Nadal was questioned at the Australian Open about the design of his training top, the world No. 2 owned up.  \u201cI\u2019m not Sharapova,\u201d the Spaniard told reporters.  \u201cMaria is doing it. I just say, \u2018I like, I don\u2019t like!\u2019 \u201d  Don Hightower, the president of major U.S. retailer Tennis Warehouse, told CNN that the clothing range was well thought out. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect combination of fashion and function. Maria\u2019s dress has become consistently more marketable over the last few years,\u201d he said.  But she faces as much competition off the court as on it. Especially among the women, the leading tennis players are battling for world domination in the fashion stakes. The Williams sisters Serena and Venus have their own ranges, while recently-deposed No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki has paired with British designer Stella McCartney to produce eye-catching outfits. Hightower said his outlets see a spike during the grand slams as customers want to purchase the latest ranges, but noted that the Sharapova-led Nike offering is \u201cthe clear leader in women\u2019s tennis apparel.\u201d Sharapova has history in setting fashion trends \u2013 the diamond-encrusted \u2018Little Black Dress\u201d she wore on the way to winning the 2006 U.S. Open was widely acclaimed. At the time, Nike did not market the outfit for wider distribution, but the company is determined to avoid a repeat and capitalize on Sharapova\u2019s global appeal. Her collaboration with Cole Haan has extended to an exclusive range of women\u2019s fashion clothing and a series of glitzy publicity launches. It undoubtedly helps that Sharapova \u2013 at 1.88 meters (six foot two inches) \u2013 has the natural height of a supermodel and is the perfect showcase for her creations. \u201cSince I was young, the artistic expression that fashion embodies has inspired me,\u201d Sharapova said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to communicate oneself.\u201d When Sharapova does decide to hang up her rackets, it is fair to assume that she will utilize her flair for design and business savvy to extend her fashion empire. She would follow legendary style names such as 1930s tennis icons Henri Lacoste and Fred Perry, while of the more recently retired stars Martina Hingis has a new collection set to hit the stores. For now, tennis takes precedence, and success in the 2012 season is a priority. \u201cI\u2019m focused on going out every day and doing my best,\u201d Sharapova said.  Of that there is no doubt."

        "content": "Expensive jewelry, art objects, animal skins, fancy pens and huge carpets that once belonged to Romania\u2019s former dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, were among items being auctioned Thursday in Bucharest. The Ceausescu couple was shot dead during the bloody 1989 revolution, but they left behind a collection of fancy and often eccentric items given to them by foreign leaders during Ceausescu\u2019s 24 years in power.  The collection of 70 objects or batches of objects contrasts his extravagant lifestyle with Romanians\u2019 struggle with poverty and hunger during the Communist era.  The name of the auction, \u201cThe Golden Age,\u201d suggests Ceausescu\u2019s last years as a leader, when the official story was that the nation was thriving, but the reality was an increasing lack of food and power, with most of the people living in fear of the Securitate secret police.  The most expensive piece, with a starting price of \u20ac3,800, nearly $5,000, was a painting called \u201cScanteia\u201d (\u201cThe Spark\u201d), showing a woman worker reading the newspaper.  Another attraction was a silver-plated pair of pigeons that Ceausescu received from the Shah of Iran, Reza Pahlavi, during a visit in 1977. A fancy Pilot Elite pen, part of the Romanian leader\u2019s collection of writing tools, had a starting price of \u20ac2,000. The gift was presented by Japan\u2019s leader in 1975 to mark Ceausescu\u2019s visit. China\u2019s founding communist leader, Mao Zedong, gave Ceausescu a bronze yak in the 1970s. It had a starting price of a mere \u20ac300.  Among the most eccentric items were two animal pelts: one from a tiger, with a starting price of \u20ac1,800, and one from a leopard, with a starting price of \u20ac1,200.  Elena Ceausescu\u2019s jewelry box had a starting price of \u20ac400.  \u201cHe was praised for an equal society, but if you look at this jewelry box you can tell the opposite,\u201d said an Oxford University student who identified himself as Steven as he visited the gallery before the auction. \u201cCeausescu and his wife had an extravagant lifestyle, like most of the communist leaders did.\u201d He added, \u201cI think the communist art sells very well as a product because it is nicely done.\u201d  \u201cThe people\u2019s most beloved son,\u201d as he used to be called, is depicted on a carpet that was once in the People\u2019s Palace, the huge building that now houses Romania\u2019s Parliament. Ceausescu is in the middle of the carpet above Communist leaders and flanked by signs saying \u201cpeace.\u201d It was given a starting price of \u20ac800.  \u201cLooking around I can tell that he created a utopian society, one in which everybody is smiling, nobody is questioning anything,\u201d said a student who identified himself as Nicky while admiring the carpet. \u201cAlthough I find it an interesting collection, full of hidden symbols, it\u2019s curious to want to own something that belonged to Ceausescu.\u201d "

        "content": "The founder of a French company that makes breast implants linked to a health scare was charged Friday with involuntary injury, his attorney told a CNN television affiliate.  Jean-Claude Mas, founder of Poly Implant Protheses, or PIP, has been released but is under judicial control, meaning he cannot leave France, attorney Yves Haddad said. He has not been charged with the more serious offense of involuntary manslaughter. Mas was arrested Thursday in Six-Fours-les-Plages, near Toulon in southern France, the French national police said.  His lawyer said Thursday his client is not feeling well and needs to see a doctor. Q&A: Implant scandal - What went wrong? PIP Director Claude Couty was arrested at about the same time as Mas in nearby La Seyne-sur-Mer, and investigators searched his home, according to CNN affiliate France 2. Mas was arrested in connection with an investigation into manslaughter and involuntary harm following the cancer death of a French woman with PIP implants in 2010,  police in Marseille said. Prosecutors opened the probe in December in Marseille. Marseille police and and public health officials are conducting the investigation, police said. Joelle Manighetti, 55, from Paris, who got PIP implants after breast cancer said she was relieved authorities were finally starting to take action \u2013 although she was disappointed it had taken so long. \u201cToo bad we do not have a justice system like they do in the United States which allows the accumulation of penalties \u2026 because the small punishment he will receive for what he did to 300,000 to 400,000 women, is not much compared to what we have suffered because of him,\u201d she said. Manighetti said she would like to tell Mas face-to-face that she is not bringing charges in order to get compensation, but because he should be punished for what he has done. Mas has been reported as saying in a police interview last year that the women who were suing over PIP implants were doing it for the money. \u201cMoney will not bring me back my health, it will not erase the scars both physical and mental that he has made on all our lives,\u201d Manighetti said. The married mother-of-three, who has been a health care professional for more than 30 years, has set up a blog to provide information and support to other women who\u2019ve had PIP implants, she says. PIP implants have sparked health scares in Europe and South America. A French attorney representing women with implants welcomed the arrest, but said it could have come sooner.  \u201cI don\u2019t expect much from his hearing as we have already heard his lack of respect with regard to all of the victims,\u201d said the lawyer, Philippe Courtois. \u201cHe will undoubtedly say there was no problem with the gel, but that is not his decision to make.\u201d  An estimated 300,000 women in 65 countries received breast implants from the company. The implants were banned in 2010, and the company went bankrupt later that year. The implants are not approved for use in the United States. French authorities announced last month that the government would pay for the removal of the bankrupt company\u2019s implants, which a British medical group says were made from \u201cnonmedical grade silicone believed by the manufacturers to be made for mattresses.\u201d German medical groups recommended this month that women seek removal of PIP breast implants, saying they need not hurry but the devices could pose eventual health problems. Authorities in France and England have dismissed fears of cancer from the implants but have said the devices are prone to rupture and could cause inflammation, scarring and fibrosis. More than 500 French women have had the implants removed since last year, according to the French government agency that evaluates the safety of medical products. Since then, more than 1,000 implants have ruptured, the agency said. The British government says there is still no statistical data to show that PIP implants are either toxic or more prone to rupturing than others. \u201cOur advice remains the same that there is not sufficient evidence to recommend routine removal. We have always recommended that women who are concerned should speak to their surgeon or GP,\u201d British Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said in a statement. "

        "content": "A handful of surviving passengers of the wrecked Costa Concordia cruise ship filed a lawsuit against the cruise line on Friday, the same day the company offered each of the hundreds who\u2019d been aboard the vessel a lump sum of 11,000 euros ($14,400). Six individuals filed the complaint asking for a jury trial and seeking retribution from Costa Cruises, its parent company Carnival Cruise Lines and two \u201cJohn Does.\u201d The suit was filed in a court in southern Florida, where Carnival is headquartered. This is not the only legal action in this case, including in the United States. Peruvian crew member Gary Lobaton filed a lawsuit, for one, on Thursday in an Illinois court, his lawyer Monica Kelly of Ribbeck Law told CNN by e-mail. Stating that she\u2019s never met those behind Friday\u2019s lawsuit, Kelly said \u201cwe will add more (plaintiffs) in the coming week.\u201d Marc Bern, a senior partner with the New York-based law firm Napoli Bern Ripka Shkolnik that is among those behind Friday\u2019s complaint, also told CNN that his firm represents \u201chundreds\u201d of passengers who were aboard the ship. He suggested that many of them could soon join his lawsuit\u2019s six named plaintiffs.  The lawsuit filed Friday states the plaintiffs first contacted Italian consumer law group Codacons, which led to the creation of \u201can international legal collaboration \u2026 to vigorously advocate for passengers\u2019 rights.\u201d The lawsuit requests \u201ceconomic and compensatory damages in excess of $10 million for the six named plaintiffs (and) punitive damages, in an amount of at least $450 million.\u201d This per-passenger figure is far larger than the $14,400 amount decided upon following a meeting between Costa Cruises and consumer groups, which was announced earlier Friday by the Italian Association of Tour Operators. The massive Costa Concordia liner struck rocks and rolled onto its side in shallow waters off an island on Italy\u2019s Tuscan coast on January 13, leading to a panicked overnight evacuation and at least 16 deaths. Another 16 people are missing. Franco Gabrielli of Italy\u2019s civil protection agency, who is heading the rescue operation, said 14 of the bodies found have now been identified. The lawsuit filed Friday faults the cruise ship operators on several counts, including \u201cmaritime negligence,\u201d \u201cgross negligence,\u201d \u201cintentional infliction of emotional distress\u201d and \u201cnegligent retention.\u201d Outlining the compensation deal it agreed to, Costa expressed \u201cits profound condolences to the families of the victims, our continued sympathy to the families of the missing, and our deep regret and sorrow for the damages and hardship the Costa Concordia accident caused to all its guests.\u201d The compensation would be paid to each passenger regardless of age and will cover damage to and loss of property and any psychological distress suffered, it said. In addition, Costa said it would reimburse the cost of the cruise and additional travel expenses and will return the contents of cabin safes to their owners if possible, and it will also set up a psychological counseling program for those passengers who request it. Separate agreements will be reached with those passengers who were injured and needed treatment at the scene and with the families of those who died, the statement added. A spokesman for the Italian Association of Tour Operators said none of the passengers was obliged to sign the agreement but, if they do, they cannot sue Costa. Jesus Garcia Heredia, who was on the cruise with his wife, told CNN he would not accept the payout. \u201cIf we can reach an agreement, I am willing to agree not to sue, no problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not for 11,000 euros. I don\u2019t accept this.\u201d Heredia said he has not yet been contacted by anyone in the company to talk about compensation. \u201cThere was a lot of loss that day,\u201d he said, referring to personal belongings and the emotional toll of the disaster. \u201cWe had it really bad there.\u201d Another passenger, Mark Plath, said he also wants to be compensated for the $6,000 worth of possessions he still has on the ship. He wants further compensation because he and his wife, Sarah, swam to shore. \u201cAlso, I helped people quite a bit, to calm down on the boat, as well as leading them to shore and to cars awaiting above, quite a while later. My wife assisted a lady with blood all over her face (my wife is a nurse),\u201d Plath wrote in an e-mail to CNN. \u201cI am not a fan of class-action lawsuits, but I think that Costa needs to take individual experiences and actions into account.\u201d And Bern, the New York lawyer tied to Friday\u2019s lawsuit, called the compensation offer \u201can insult.\u201d \u201cThis was not an incident that could possibly be covered by the ticket limitations,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. \u201cThis is an act of horrendous negligence.\u201d At the same time, Bern said that the compensation requested in his firm\u2019s lawsuit \u2013 $10 million for each plaintiff plus punitive damages around $450 million \u2013 are high in part to get \u201cthe attention of the defendants.\u201d \u201cWe do not know the nature and the full extent of the damages that these people have suffered,\u201d the lawyer added. Roberto Corbella, president of the tour operators association, said the compensation offer \u201caims to give, after such a serious disgrace, a quick, concrete and adequate answer.\u201d The 11,000 euro lump sum reflects Italian and international law, he said, with Costa likely to pay out about 3,000 euros more per passenger on top of that in refunds and travel costs. He estimated the total cost of the offer at more than 40 million euros ($59 million), not counting separate agreements with the injured and families of those missing or killed. Even after the incident, Corbella said cruise cancellations are only running about 10% higher than average. Costa has said anyone who booked before January 13 for a future cruise and wishes to cancel may do so without penalty, provided they get in touch by February 7. Meanwhile, the captain of the Costa Concordia, Francesco Schettino, is under house arrest and faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship. Prosecutors on Friday questioned Ciro Ambrosio, Schettino\u2019s deputy on board the ship. Entering the tribunal, his lawyer told reporters: \u201cWe have many arms to defend us with honor. We don\u2019t feel responsible.\u201d  Schettino has admitted to prosecutors, defense attorneys and a judge that he made a \u201cmistake\u201d in colliding with the rocks off shore. But he has brushed aside suggestions that he was going too fast, as prosecutors allege. In a 126-page transcript, Schettino said he ran the ship aground to keep it from sinking and limit the tilting.  Efforts were under way Friday to open up new passages in the ship\u2019s hull so rescuers could access more areas, said Gabrielli, of Italy\u2019s civil protection agency. Operations to remove 2,400 tons fuel from the liner\u2019s tanks will begin Saturday afternoon or Sunday, after a slight delay, he told reporters. Weather and sea conditions are expected to worsen Saturday, leading to higher waves, Gabrielli said. While this will not prevent the removal of fuel, it could present more risk to the environment if anything goes wrong, he said. Residents of Giglio island near the site of the shipwreck have complained of seeing white filaments in the sea, he said, but further testing is needed to confirm the origin of the substance."

        "content": "Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of Poland over the signing of an international treaty to enforce intellectual property rights on the Internet. Police said more than 10,000 people have taken part in the countrywide protests, which began Wednesday and are set to continue Friday. A group of lawmakers in parliament also protested the signing Thursday in Tokyo by the Polish ambassador to Japan. The legislation must be ratified by the Polish parliament before coming into effect. Protesters held signs and banners reading \u201cNo to ACTA.\u201d Their protests were largely peaceful, though there were a few skirmishes in the city of Poznan, where protesters threw bottles at police. Activists hacked several websites, including that of the prime minister, to protest the signing. The activists say the treaty \u2013 called ACTA, or the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement \u2013 amounts to Internet censorship. The European Commission describes ACTA as a \u201cmajor initiative\u201d designed to fight piracy and the counterfeiting of goods at the international level. It says the agreement would not censor or shut down websites and, unlike the SOPA bill recently put on hold in the U.S. Congress, it would not change legislation. ACTA allows criminal procedures and penalties to be applied in cases of counterfeiting and piracy, such as the unauthorized copying of movies. Penalties would be applied to offenders as well as those guilty of \u201caiding and abetting\u201d the crime. The actual penalties would be up to the individual countries that have signed onto ACTA. SOPA, introduced by the U.S. House of Representatives, and a sister bill in the Senate called PIPA, aim to crack down on copyright infringement by restricting access to websites that host or facilitate the trading of pirated content."

        "content": "Prime Minister David Cameron acknowledged Thursday there had been no movement on renegotiating Britain\u2019s inclusion in a treaty thrashed out by European leaders last month in a bid to stave off a debt crisis.  Britain was alone among the 27 European Union nations in refusing point-blank to sign the European deal, intended to ensure the closer integration of the national budgets of the 17 eurozone countries that use the euro as a currency. The so-called \u201cfiscal compact\u201d would usher in a new legal framework and greater fiscal scrutiny, as well as measures to strengthen mechanisms that guarantee short-term stability for euro economies in trouble.  Britain\u2019s refusal to sign the treaty means the countries that back the compact must go ahead with the deal outside the European Union. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Cameron told CNN that he could not see that scenario changing. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen that movement because the conditions we set out are the conditions we set out \u2013 and they haven\u2019t been moved towards,\u201d he said.  Cameron\u2019s comments come ahead of a European summit meeting in Brussels on Monday. Some had thought that a deal would be reached between Britain\u2019s European partners that would allow Cameron to reverse his potential veto. But, Cameron said, \u201cI don\u2019t see that development.\u201d And he said Britain would not be disadvantaged by putting itself outside the discussions on the treaty. \u201cThe reason we didn\u2019t join the treaty is the same reason we are not joining it today,\u201d he said. \u201cWe asked for safeguards, we asked for conditions particularly around the single market and financial services\u2026 we haven\u2019t got those safeguards, so they can\u2019t have a treaty inside the European Union.\u201d But Britain would still be at the heart of the debate on \u201cwhat really matters\u201d in Brussels, he said \u2013 the single market, competitiveness and helping Europe\u2019s economies grow. In December, Cameron said he had effectively vetoed an original deal, forcing German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy to forge ahead with a treaty that will be subservient to EU regulations. The new treaty is due to be finalized until March 2012, after which it will have to be ratified by all participating countries. Hungary, Sweden and the Czech Republic also expressed reservations about treaty change \u2013 but left the door open, pending parliamentary debate. Cameron said it was in Britain\u2019s interest as well as that of its European neighbors that the current debt crisis was resolved, but acknowledged that it wouldn\u2019t be easy. If the single currency is to work, the prime minister said, some short-term measures have to be taken and longer-term issues grappled with. \u201cShort term, to ease the current crisis you have got to resolve the Greek situation, you\u2019ve got to strengthen the banks, and the firewall\u2019s got to be big enough to deal with any contagion in the system,\u201d he said. And in an apparent sign of frustration at the lack of progress, he added: \u201cYou could almost set it to music because politicians have been saying it for so long \u2013 but we\u2019ve got to deliver it in the beginning of this year, and that\u2019s only the start.\u201d Cameron also rejected suggestions he should ease the austerity measures his government has imposed in Britain, even as the eurozone heads into recession.  Britain has to show the world it is paying down its debt in order to ensure its recovery and keep interest rates as low as they are, he said.  \u201cIf you took your foot off the pedal and you eased up and spent some more money\u2026 you could lose all the benefit of that, by those interest rates going up.\u201d"

        "content": "A civil court in Munich has blocked a British publisher\u2019s plans to print excerpts of Adolf Hitler\u2019s \u201cMein Kampf\u201d in Germany later this month. The court ruled Wednesday that British publisher Peter McGee\u2019s plans to disseminate portions of the anti-Semitic manifesto in Germany were not protected by long-standing citation rights. Initially slated to hit the shelves in the Zeitungszeugen magazine in Germany on January 26, it would have been the first time that any parts of the book had been reprinted in a newspaper or magazine in that country since the end of World War II.  Disappointed with the court\u2019s decision, Alexander Luckow, an adviser to McGee, said Germans were only prolonging the inevitable. \u201cPutting a lid on things for the next three years and locking it away isn\u2019t helping,\u201d Luckow told CNN. Contrary to popular belief, there is no law in Germany forbidding the publishing of \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d but the Bavarian state government \u2013 which owns the publishing copyright \u2013 has always blocked reprints. These rights, however, are set to expire in 2015, which will then allow anyone to publish the entire volume or excerpts. The Institute for Contemporary History in Munich is already preparing a scholarly edition of the book set to come out that year, according to Dr. Edith Raim, who is working on the project. In light of the court\u2019s ruling, consumers can only get their hands on censored versions of the magazine, with the controversial excerpts too blurry to read. Luckow said this was to prevent the authorities from confiscating copies of the magazine. The magazine\u2019s legal team plans to appeal the court\u2019s decision as early as next week, Luckow said. Since McGee\u2019s plans were made public, Jewish groups in Germany and abroad have been divided about the project. The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, said January 17 that it was preferable for Germans to read annotated excerpts of Hitler\u2019s writings in an academic context rather than accessing the unfiltered material online. \u201cI can truly do without the publication of this hate-filled book that is saturated with anti-Semitism to the core,\u201d Graumann told Israel\u2019s Jerusalem Post. \u201c(But) if one must actually read it, then it\u2019s better in the framework of a critical commentary.\u201d While some historians expressed few qualms with the announcement that parts of the book would be reprinted in Germany, a group representing Holocaust survivors and their families questioned the value of such a move. \u201cWe want to make clear that there is nothing altruistic in the motivation of this publisher,\u201d said Elan Steinberg, vice president of the American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors and Their Descendents. \u201cHe\u2019s out to make a profit.\u201d \u201cThere is a reason that the public display of the swastika is illegal in Germany,\u201d Steinberg added. \u201cFor these same historic and moral reasons, it is offensive to think that kiosks in Berlin will again \u2013 70 years after the end of that evil regime \u2013 be selling Hitler\u2019s \u2018Mein Kampf.\u2019\u201d Hitler wrote the book from prison after his failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, outlining his anti-Semitic ideology.

        "content": "It was supposed to be a unique way to engage with their fans via social media \u2013 but for Germany\u2019s most successful soccer club it turned into the ultimate public relations own goal. Bayern Munich, who can boast 22 German league titles and have four times been crowned champions of Europe, revealed they would be unveiling a \u201cspectacular\u201d new signing on Thursday \u2013 a snippet of news to excite any fan. But when the announcement was made, on their official Facebook page, it turned out to be a new marketing tool that displayed users of the social networking site as the new signing. The gimmick immediately led to a backlash from angry supporters, who bombarded the club\u2019s Facebook page with over 5,000 largely negative comments \u2013 forcing Bayern into a hasty retreat, complete with an apology. According to one sports PR expert, Bayern\u2019s concept was clever, but their execution undoubtedly missed the target. \u201cThe idea of enticing people online is a nice one but the fundamental problem is you don\u2019t do that so they end up feeling disappointed,\u201d Jason Madeley, founder of communications agency Hatch PR, told CNN. \u201cWhat Bayern have failed to understand is the passion football fans have for their team and their excitement about getting a new striker. \u201cThey feel like they\u2019ve been taken for a fool and what you can\u2019t do with fans is take them for a fool, you need to respect them as integral to the club and that brand. They\u2019ve not thought it through very well.\u201d Within hours of their \u2018announcement\u2019 Bayern had posted the following statement on their Facebook page: \u201cSorry dear fans, as we see from your numerous comments, you are very upset about today\u2019s action. \u201cIt was not our intention to disappoint you with the new app. Rather, we wanted to provide you with this action and thus show how important each fan is for Bayern Munich.\u201d Most of Europe\u2019s top clubs have a Twitter account and a Facebook page, and are slowly grappling with how best to utilize them to interact with fans and grow their brand. But though Bayern\u2019s brainwave is novel and they can certainly claim to have got their message out to the masses \u2013 it appears like they have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. Madeley added: \u201cWe all say you\u2019ve got to be part of the conversation; with fans it is so important to have an equal understanding of their views so you\u2019re part of that conversation.\u201d So what is the expert\u2019s view on the best way for Bayern to extricate themselves from this public relations mess? \u201cGo and sign a very good striker tomorrow!\u201d"

        "content": "In terms of age, just two years separate Australian Open finalists Maria Sharapova and Victoria Azarenka. But in terms of what the two young women have achieved in their tennis careers so far, they are poles apart. Since bursting onto the scene as a 17-year-old Wimbledon champion in 2004, Sharapova\u2019s model looks and three grand slam triumphs, combined with her rise and fall from the top of the world rankings, have kept her in the public eye. In contrast, the 22-year-old Azarenka is enjoying her finest run at one of tennis\u2019 four major tournaments. Thursday\u2019s 6-4 1-6 6-3 semifinal win over defending champion Kim Clijsters has put her within touching distance of a first grand slam title. To add extra spice to Saturday\u2019s Melbourne showdown, both world No. 4 Sharapova and the third-ranked Azarenka can claim top spot with victory in the Rod Laver Arena showdown How do you solve a problem like Maria? Tennis\u2019 battle with the grunters \u201cIt means so much to be back in a grand slam final,\u201d Sharapova told reporters after beating No. 2 Petra Kvitova. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to get this far here at the Australian Open again after losing quite early the last couple of years.\u201d The 2008 champion secured her place in the title match with a 6-2 3-6 6-4 win over Kvitova, the 21-year-old Czech rising star who defeated Sharapova in the Wimbledon final last July and also had hopes of replacing Caroline Wozniacki at the rankings summit. For Sharapova, the U.S. Open champion in 2006, becoming world No. 1 again would crown a renaissance which has seen her overcome a recurring shoulder injury which first struck five years ago.  It forced her to miss nearly 10 months of action between May 2008 and March 2009. But despite her struggle, Sharapova insisted that winning a second Australian Open is her sole motivation. \u201cI don\u2019t regret anything that has happened \u2013 obviously it would have been nice not to have a serious injury at 21 years old, but sometimes it\u2019s just the way things go. The good thing is I found a way to come back. \u201cIt\u2019s more about the grand slam win than the ranking. Having been in that position before, it doesn\u2019t really add anything for me.\u201d While Sharapova is working her way back to the pinnacle of the sport, Azarenka is riding as high as she\u2019s ever been in the world rankings. Her best run at a grand slam prior to this tournament was a semifinal appearance at Wimbledon last year, where she was beaten by Kvitova. \u201cI really wanted it bad,\u201d Azarenka said. \u201cThere were a lot of ups and downs, but in a good way.\u201d Azarenka dug deep after being pummeled by former world No. 1 and four-time grand slam winner Clijsters in the second set, earning a crucial break in the eighth game of the decider to propel her to success. \u201cShe was coming up with some incredible shots and I was really going for it. It was important to get that 5-3 lead and keep putting pressure on,\u201d Azarenka said. \u201cIt was difficult to get back in the match, to keep fighting and to keep going, but that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. And I was really, really happy to win the match.\u201d The victory continued Azarenka\u2019s impressive early-season form \u2013 she has now won all 11 matches in 2012. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between saying it and feeling it,\u201d she said of the effect her form is having on her confidence. \u201cYou really have to trust. You really have to feel it.  \u201cYou can\u2019t just say you believe you\u2019re going to do it, you have to work your way through it and always try to make that extra during practice, because it\u2019s not coming in one day.\u201d While Azarenka has no experience of a grand slam final, Sharapova will be playing in her sixth. She has won three and lost two \u2013 including a defeat to American Serena Williams in the 2007 Australian Open. It is impossible to split the pair in the head-to-read statistics, with both players having won three of their six encounters. Sharapova won their most recent match in Rome in May, on her way to overall victory at the clay-court event, when Azarenka was forced to retire in the second set. However, the Belorussian had the honors when they met in the final of the Miami Masters in April."

        "content": "The world\u2019s most influential political and business leaders are gathering in an upmarket ski resort in the Swiss Alps this week to discuss the biggest challenges facing society in 2012. Six hundred miles away from the snows of Davos, in rainy London members of the Occupy movement are celebrating 100 days since they set up camp outside St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, hoping to find solutions to some of the same problems. The protesters have been there since October 15 last year, battling both the elements and the authorities.  Their decision to establish a protest village in the heart of London\u2019s financial district, the City, was a controversial one. Demonstrators had first attempted to occupy the nearby London Stock Exchange, but were quickly moved on. Instead they pitched their tents around the steps of St Paul\u2019s, one of the most famous landmarks in the city: A symbol of London\u2019s endurance during the dark days of the Blitz, and a site of celebration, as the venue for the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981. The camp sparked rows between the authorities and the church, which stepped in to protect the occupiers from the police, allowing them to stay, despite threats of eviction. Two leading members of St Paul\u2019s later resigned over the row. Jesse Jackson: Occupy in memory of MLK Occupy London spokeswoman Naomi Colvin says the movement has achieved a tremendous amount in its first 100 days. \u201cIt has been an astounding success,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cIt is very noticeable how all the political parties represented in parliament have been bringing themselves around to Occupy \u2013 we are setting agendas that others then follow.\u201d Protester Bryn Phillips agrees: \u201cWe\u2019ve raised a lot of important issues, we\u2019ve made it possible to discuss a lot of subjects which were not being mentioned, and we have been able to include the public and people who are usually excluded in that discourse. \u201cFive years ago, if you talked about the problems of capitalism, you were branded a maniac, now even [Conservative British Prime Minister] David Cameron is talking about the nature of capitalism; we\u2019ve made it possible to discuss it without people accusing you of being a communist.\u201d Last week, the City of London Corporation won a high court fight to force the closure of the camp. The occupiers insist they will appeal, but Phillips concedes it may be time to move on. \u201cPersonally, I think it is time for the tents to go,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have served their purpose, but I think there is a risk of us becoming too emotionally attached to them. \u201cBy occupying part of the City of London, we have found out a lot, we have raised a lot of issues: The lack of transparency, the lack of accountability, but we don\u2019t need to be outside St Paul\u2019s to do that any more.\u201d Colvin insists, though, that any shift away from the original site will not signify the end of Occupy London \u2013 quite the contrary: Whether or not the St Paul\u2019s camp survives, she says, the movement itself will continue to make its presence felt in the coming weeks, months and years. \u201cI think we will see day-long \u2018Occupations\u2019 in city centers, in shopping areas and in other locations, and I think Occupy will spread out more into the community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have brought a lot of people together, people with specialist knowledge, who have been able to create networks of expertise, and those links, those conversations will continue, whether the physical site is there or not.\u201d Occupiers are already doing outreach work, giving talks in citizenship classes at local schools, and encouraging people to become more involved in democracy. Phillips says this and other community work is key. \u201cOur society has gradually been confiscated, fragmented over the past few years, and the point of Occupy is to help repair the severed links, to restore a sense of reciprocity and social cooperation. \u201cWe need to get out into the boroughs and the parishes, and to support the non-economic institutions which are trying to do the same thing, whether that means churches or Citizens\u2019 Advice Bureaus.\u201d And some camping will continue at Finsbury Square, which began as an overflow from the main site at St Paul\u2019s, and where there is, Colvin hopes, \u201cno threat of eviction\u201d \u2013 occupiers there are hoping to create a sustainable eco village. Paul, from Lincolnshire, is a relatively new arrival at Finsbury Square. He says Occupy was never intended as a quick-fix. \u201cIt\u2019s a long-term protest movement,\u201d he told CNN, sitting in front of a wood-burner to keep warm in the drizzle. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen huge one-day demonstrations before \u2013 the march against the war in Iraq had 1.5 million people in it, but it didn\u2019t stop anything. \u201cThe government is supposed to be there for the people, but they don\u2019t do anything for us when we ask,\u201d he said, explaining that he hopes that will change, in the face of a concerted and long-lasting Occupy campaign. Fellow occupier Jack, back at St Paul\u2019s, agrees. \u201cWe won\u2019t be rushed \u2013 we are only three months into a discussion which is so big, and so important, how can you expect us to have reached a consensus already? Give us a chance, be patient.\u201d But Jack insists that Occupy is far more relevant to ordinary people than the World Economic Forum, which he says welcomes only the global elite. \u201cI think Davos is the complete opposite of Occupy \u2013 Davos is there to represent the powerful, while we\u2019re here to represent the people. We\u2019re trying to balance things out as best we can, to show that there are alternatives to the system as it stands, to have a debate about it, but not to impose our views on people. \u201cDavos is very exclusive, whereas we welcome anyone, we are completely inclusive \u2013 to the point of madness sometimes, because you do get the occasional crackpot \u2013 and everyone is listened to. \u201cIt seems very unequal, very unfair, because I don\u2019t believe that [the delegates at Davos] all want to make the world a better place for everyone, and yet they are the ones holding all the tools, they are the ones with a lot of the power to do that.\u201d But there are Occupiers in Davos too. They may not have made it onto the stage at the World Economic Forum, or be taking part in debates with the likes of Angela Merkel and Al Gore, but they are here all the same, in a temporary settlement of igloos and yurts near the conference center. Blog: Meeting the Occupy Davos protesters \u201cWe are not just here to build igloos,\u201d David Roth told CNN. \u201cWe are here to have protests on the streets. \u201cWe should take the power back; we should not let the richest 1% have the power \u2013 they cannot be the solution for our crisis, because they are the crisis, they are responsible for the crisis.\u201d And there are signs that despite the icy temperatures, relations between the two camps, Occupy and the World Economic Forum, may be thawing. \u201cThere have been attempts to broker a conversation,\u201d says Colvin. \u201cIt may not happen this year, but we hope it can happen in future.\u201d Robert Greenhill, WEF managing director, recently dropped in to the Davos camp to help build one of the igloos, and later hinted on Twitter that the groups have more in common than some might think. \u201cDifferent approach, same goal: Improving the state of the world.\u201d"

        "content": "Caroline Wozniacki doesn\u2019t like losing \u2013 and it\u2019s a trait that the tennis star\u2019s nearest and dearest also possess.  Born into a sports-mad family, the Danish star had to battle for supremacy within the competitive environment of her childhood home in Odense, long before she had designs of making tennis her career. Both her father Piotr and older brother Patrik were professional footballers. Mother Anna played volleyball for Poland, where both parents were born \u2013 and lived until Piotr joined a Danish club. \u201cSport was in my genes,\u201d Wozniacki told CNN\u2019s Open Court program. \u201cBut nobody would play me because they said I wasn\u2019t good enough \u2013 they always put me in the umpire\u2019s chair! \u201cBut I was stubborn and started to practice playing tennis every day by hitting balls against a wall. I wanted to beat my parents first, then my brother. That was the ultimate goal, to beat my brother, and when it happened I was so happy!\u201d Piotr has been Wozniacki\u2019s coach for most of her career, but she has also started working with Spaniard Ricardo Sanchez. \u201cMy dad is still on court every day as well. I think it\u2019s important for me to stick to the same team,\u201d she said.  \u201cI\u2019ve always gotten someone from the outside helping me with small details, and yeah \u2013 I am thinking that can help.\u201d Wozniacki\u2019s recent Australian Open quarterfinal defeat to defending champion Kim Clijsters will have hurt her enormously, not least because it meant she also lost the world number one ranking she had held for 67 consecutive weeks. Critics bemoan the fact that Wozniacki has risen so high before earning a first grand slam title, but she has already won 18 WTA tournaments and earned nearly $12 million in career prize money. Add to that her celebrity boyfriend \u2013 top golfer Rory McIlroy, who also hates losing \u2013 and Wozniacki is fast becoming a darling of the tabloid press.  The 21-year-old has no problems with the attention she receives and relishes being a role model to children, just like Martina Hingis and Venus Williams were when she was an adoring young fan. \u201cOn the practice courts, I see the small girls wearing Stella McCartney outfits & Yonex rackets. It\u2019s really nice to see,\u201d said Wozniacki, referring to the clothes line she wears and the equipment she endorses. \u201cI remember myself when I was a little girl, looking up to Martina Hingis. I wanted to play like her and have the same clothes as her.  \u201cI also remember when Venus came to Copenhagen for an exhibition. I was 12 at the time. I went down to the court and asked her if she would play one point with me. \u201cShe did and I never forget that. I think it\u2019s also right to give something back to the people who follow you.\u201d Wozniacki also gives something back to her fans via the Internet. Like McIlroy, she is an avid user of social networking site Twitter and has accumulated over 270,000 followers. McIlroy has a remarkable 800,000 followers, meaning over one million people get to know the couple\u2019s inner thoughts and feelings every day.  \u201cI like Twitter a lot,\u201d said Wozniacki. \u201cIt is a great way to get the fans knowing another side of you. \u201cI also think it is a good way to put things straight that are maybe misrepresented in the media. I have fun with it and give Rory a hard time on it!  \u201c(U.S. tennis player) Mardy Fish also gets involved on Twitter. I hit two aces against him in the Hopman Cup and teased him about it on Twitter.\u201d But it is Wozniacki\u2019s achievements on the court which still create the biggest news, not all of it positive. However, she has a relaxed attitude to her \u201cslam drought.\u201d \u201cMy dream as a little girl was to be world number one and to win grand slams. I\u2019ve finished as number one two years in a row and a slam is obviously my next goal,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just about peaking at the right time and playing well for two weeks. I\u2019ve reached the finals and semifinals before, so I know I can do it. Everything has just gone so fast because I am still only 21 but at the same time I feel like I have been on the WTA Tour for a while. She added: \u201cYoung players are starting to come up as well and they will see me as one of the older, experienced ones.  \u201cI just have to get used to that. I used to always be the young one playing without pressure, but I am just happy to be where I am and enjoying my time.\u201d"

        "content": "World No. 3 Rory McIlroy eclipsed illustrious playing partners Luke Donald and Tiger Woods as he took a share of the lead after the opening day of the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship. The 2011 U.S. Open champion shot a five-under-par 67 to join Sweden\u2019s Robert Karlsson at the top of the leaderboard. McIlroy\u2019s fellow Northern Irishman Gareth Maybin was on four under, alongside England\u2019s Richard Finch and Jean-Baptiste Gonnet of France. Woods couldn\u2019t keep pace with his 22-year-old playing partner, but was only three shots off the lead despite struggling on the greens, while world No. 1 Donald finished on one under. McIlroy didn\u2019t enjoy his cleanest day of hitting but still scrambled well to record an impressive score in his first competitive tournament since recovering from suspected Dengue fever. \u201cIt was a good score and a great way to start 2012, but I don\u2019t feel I drove the ball particularly well and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve got to work on,\u201d he told the European Tour\u2019s official website.  \u201cIt was nothing that a good practice session won\u2019t fix.\u201d McIlroy has recorded two top-three finishes in the past two seasons at the Abu Dhabi Golf Club but couldn\u2019t get past German Martin Kaymer, who has won back-to-back titles. He said of the course: \u201cI feel it suits me really well. Just one problem \u2013 it suits Martin Kaymer even better.\u201d Kaymer, though, toiled during the opening round of his defense, shooting a five-over 77 to sit 10 shots off the leaders. Woods enjoyed a bogey-free round with one birdie on the front nine and one on the back nine.  \u201cI just had a hard time getting a feel for these greens. It was difficult and my speed was off,\u201d the American said after his first competitive round of 2012. Donald also recorded two birdies but bogeyed the seventh hole to sit a shot behind Woods. He admitted he\u2019d enjoyed battling it out in such a star-studded group. \u201cIt was fun to be part of that threesome \u2013 Tiger and Rory are huge names in the world of sport. Rory took advantage of a few more opportunities. I didn\u2019t make too many putts,\u201d Donald said. South Africa\u2019s Masters champion Charl Schwartzel was on two under, while world No. 2 Lee Westwood and 2010 U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell both sat on level par."

        "content": "The founder of a French company that makes breast implants linked to a health scare was arrested Thursday, the French national police said. Jean-Claude Mas, founder of Poly Implant Protheses, or PIP, was detained in Six-Fours-les-Plages, near Toulon in southern France, police said.  PIP Director Claude Couty was arrested around the same time in nearby La Seyne-sur-Mer, and investigators searched his home, according to CNN affiliate France 2. Mas was arrested in connection with an investigation into manslaughter and involuntary harm following the cancer death of a French woman with PIP implants in 2010,  police in Marseille said. Prosecutors opened the probe in December in Marseille. Marseille police and and public health officials are conducting the investigation, police said. PIP implants have sparked health scares in Europe and South America. A French attorney representing women with implants welcomed the arrest of Mas, though he said it could have come sooner.  \u201cI don\u2019t expect much from his hearing as we have already heard his lack of respect with regard to all of the victims,\u201d said the lawyer, Philippe Courtois. \u201cHe will undoubtedly say there was no problem with the gel, but that is not his decision to make,\u201d Courtois added.  An estimated 300,000 women in 65 countries received breast implants from the company. The implants were banned in 2010, and the company went bankrupt later that year. The implants are not approved for use in the United States. French authorities announced last month that the government would pay for the removal of the bankrupt company\u2019s implants, which a British medical group says were made from \u201cnonmedical grade silicone believed by the manufacturers to be made for mattresses.\u201d German medical groups recommended this month that women seek removal of PIP breast implants, saying they need not hurry but the devices could pose eventual health problems. Authorities in France and England have dismissed fears of cancer from the implants but have said the devices are prone to rupture and could cause inflammation, scarring and fibrosis. More than 500 French women have had the implants removed since last year, according to the French government agency that evaluates the safety of medical products. Since then, more than 1,000 implants have ruptured, the agency said. The British government says there is still no statistical data to show that PIP implants are either toxic or more prone to rupturing than others. \u201cOur advice remains the same that there is not sufficient evidence to recommend routine removal. We have always recommended that women who are concerned should speak to their surgeon or GP,\u201d British Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said in a statement.  \u201cThe (National Health Service) will support removal of PIP implants if, after this consultation, the patient still has concerns and with her doctor she decides that it is right to do so,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that private health care providers have a moral duty to offer the same service to their patients that we will offer to NHS patients \u2013 free information, consultations, scans and removal if necessary.\u201d"

The Spaniard triumphed 6-7 (5-7) 6-2 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 in three hours and 42 minutes as he set up a clash with either defending champion Novak Djokovic or British fourth seed Andy Murray, who meet in Friday\u2019s second semifinal. Nadal, seeking his 11th grand slam title, extended his winning record over Swiss third seed Federer to 18-9 \u2013 and 8-2 in major tournaments. Federer, who has a record 16 grand slam titles to his name, saved a match point but was unable to repeat the form that had seen the 30-year-old not drop a set in his previous five matches in Melbourne. It capped a remarkable turnaround in fortunes for Nadal, who feared that he might not be fit to start the tournament. \u201cSunday afternoon, 24 hours to play my first match, I was in my room crying  because I believed I didn\u2019t have the chance to play in Melbourne,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cTwo weeks later I am here in the finals, so it is a dream for me because I had very bad expectations 24 hours before the first match, and now two weeks later I am playing well. I am in the final. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic victory for me. I\u2019m very, very happy playing against the greatest in history in semifinals, in a big match on Rod Laver Arena. It\u2019s one of the victories that\u2019s going to stay in my mind forever.\u201d Federer has not beaten Nadal at a grand slam tournament since Wimbledon in 2007 but the Swiss took the opening set on a tiebreak. Nadal, who lost six finals to Djokovic last year and his No. 1 ranking, responded with a determination that he seems to reserve for matches against his friend and longtime foe. \u201cWe have had good matches over the years,\u201d Federer said. \u201cI enjoy playing him. The crowd really gets into it, which is nice. We have a lot of respect for each other, which is good, too, I think. \u201cWe also play well against each other. I always think he plays a bit better against me than against other players, but that\u2019s good for him.\u201d Even an extended break for Australia Day fireworks in the second set could not halt the 25-year-old Nadal\u2019s momentum, as he won 11 points in a row. \u201cIt\u2019s not helpful, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Federer said. \u201cI probably don\u2019t want to say I would have lost the set anyway, but I was down in the score.  \u201cBut they told us before, so it wasn\u2019t a surprise for us.\u201d"

David Alvarez\u2019s goal four minutes into stoppage time at the end of the game sealed a thrilling victory for the tournament\u2019s co-hosts who were rank outsiders to progress from Group A. But it means heartbreak for Senegal, who are rock bottom of the group and cannot qualify for the last eight. Senegal dominated large chunks of the game but Iban Iyanga put Equatorial Guinea \u2013 ranked 151st in the world \u2013 ahead on 62 minutes. That looked like being enough to seal the game until substitute Moussa Sow equalized with a minute of normal time left, only for Alvarez to drill a shot into the net to delight the vociferous home crowd. The Equatorial Guinea sqaud, who received a bonus of $1 million from Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, son of Equatorial Guinea\u2019s president, for their win in the opening game of the tournament over Libya can now expect another reward. In Wednesday\u2019s other match, Zambia twice fought back from a goal down against Libya to draw 2-2 in Bata and put themselves in the driving seat to qualify second in the group. Torrential rain delayed kick-off but when the match did get under way, large sections of the pitch were covered with standing water. Despite the poor conditions, it took Libya just five minutes to score as Walid El Khatroushi played in Ahmed Osman who finished calmly. Zamiba were level on the half hour as Rainford Kalaba\u2019s cross was expertly hooked into the net by Emmanuel Mayuka. But Libya again edged in front just after half time when Osman displayed neat footwork in the area to squeeze a shot in off the post. Back came Zambia though, as Christopher Katongo headed in at the back post on 54 minutes. Zambia have four points to Libya\u2019s one going into the final group games."

        "content": "U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy is relishing the chance to lock horns with 14-time major winner Tiger Woods and world number one Luke Donald when the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship tees off Thursday. McIlroy, world number three, will get a ringside view of Woods\u2019 start to the 2012 season, as he bids to recapture the form that saw him spend 623 consecutive weeks as the sport\u2019s best player between 2005 and 2010. The Northern Irishman will also be alongside Donald, who finished top of the money list on both the European and U.S Tour last year. McIlroy saw his own star rise in 2011, capturing his first major title at the U.S. Open, and he admits he can\u2019t wait to test himself against two of the biggest stars in the modern game. After joking at a press conference that the draw was \u201cnot exactly low profile,\u201d McIlroy added: \u201cIt will definitely get the juices flowing. Woods primed for 2012 challenge \u201cThere\u2019s not many tournaments where you get really excited about a Thursday or a Friday, but this is one of these times.\u201d McIlroy admits idolizing Woods as a youngster and says he felt more than a little trepidation when he came face-to-face with the 36-year-old for the first time. He explained: \u201cThe first time you play with him \u2013 you\u2019ve watched this guy your whole life, winning majors and doing things that no-one thought was possible \u2013  so you are going to be awestruck. \u201cI suppose once I got to spend a little time with him and maybe have lunch with him a few times and everything, you can sort of break the barrier down a little bit and it\u2019s fine from there. I feel quite comfortable being around him.\u201d Woods has been struggling for form ever since 2009 when a sex scandal engulfed him, and though he suffered an injury-hit 2011, he won his first tournament in two years at the Chevron World Challenge in November. McIlroy practiced with Woods on Tuesday ahead of Thursday\u2019s opening round and says his rival is still a force to be reckoned with. \u201cHe still is the face of golf,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cHe set the benchmark for a lot of guys \u2013 no-one may play the way he did in 2001. He\u2019s still the main attraction in 2012. \u201cI see him contending again in majors. I practiced with him and he looked in good shape. He seems determined and looks at full fitness.  \u201cIt can only be good for the game. Hopefully I can get in the mix with him down the stretch on a few Sundays.\u201d"

The world No. 1 pulled up and clutched his leg while leading 2-1 in the second set, but recovered to secure a 6-4 7-6 (7-4) 6-1 win over the Spaniard despite moving uncomfortably between points. \u201cLuckily for me it wasn\u2019t something that stayed there for long time,\u201d the four-time grand slam winner told reporters after reaching his seventh straight grand slam semifinal.  \u201cIt was just a sudden pain \u2026 David makes you run, makes you play an extra shot, makes you earn your points.\u201d Kvitova faces Sharapova in semifinal rematch However, the Serbian revealed that he has been struggling with his breathing in the Melbourne heat. \u201cI found it very difficult after a long time to breathe because I felt the whole day my nose was closed a little bit. I just wasn\u2019t able to get enough oxygen,\u201d he said.   \u201cAt this stage of the tournament, when you\u2019re playing somebody like David who has great shots from both sides from the baseline, makes you always play over five to 10 shots in the rally, your physical strength and endurance comes into question.   \u201cI think actually I\u2019m not concerned. I\u2019m really fit and I have no concerns of recovering for the next match. It\u2019s just a matter of breathing better through the nose.\u201d Fourth seed Murray is searching for a first major title, having been beaten in the last two Melbourne finals by Roger Federer in 2010 and then Djokovic last year. The Scot, also beaten by Federer in the 2008 U.S. Open title match, ended the hopes of Japanese 24th seed Kei Nishikori with a 6-3 6-3 6-1 success in their quarterfinal.  \u201cHe\u2019s definitely very motivated to win his first grand slam,\u201d said Djokovic of Murray after reaching his fifth successive grand slam semifinal.  \u201cHe\u2019s been proving to himself and to the rest of the people that the Australian Open is probably his best grand slam. \u201cBut on the other hand I have been playing quite well here in last couple years \u2026 it\u2019s definitely going to take a lot of effort to be a winner from that match.\u201d World No. 26 Nishikori was Japan\u2019s first Australian Open quarterfinalist since 1932 and the first male player from the country to reach the last eight of a major since Shuzo Matsuoka at Wimbledon in 1995. Next week he will move into the top-20 for the first time in his career. Djokovic holds the edge in the head-to-head record against Murray, having won six and lost four of their 10 matches \u2013 including victory in their only clash at a grand slam. That 2011 final defeat sent Murray into a minor form slump, but he bounced back to reach the last four at Roland Garros, Wimbledon and Flushing Meadows. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked playing against him. After the year that he had, the loss didn\u2019t look so bad six months later,\u201d Murray said of Djokovic, who won three of 2011\u2019s four grand slam titles. \u201cI\u2019ll need to serve better. I had a sore neck today when I woke up and I wasn\u2019t feeling all my serve. But I was returning good, hitting the ball clean from the back of the court, moved forward well. So it was good.\u201d   Thursday\u2019s first semifinal will see second seed and 10-time grand slam champion Rafael Nadal take on Switzerland\u2019s No. 4 Federer \u2013 a winner of a record 16 major titles. Djokovic, Murray, Nadal and Federer have dominated men\u2019s tennis in recent years, filling the final four spots at three of the last five grand slams.  At least three of the four top-ranked players have advanced to the semifinals in each of the last seven majors."

        "content": "Barcelona survived a late onslaught from rivals Real Madrid to win their Spanish Cup quarterfinal tie 4-3 on aggregate and knock the holders out on Wednesday. In a dramatic game at Barcelona\u2019s Camp Nou stadium, the hosts went 2-0 up thanks to goals from Pedro and Daniel Alves before strikes from Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema leveled the match at 2-2.  Real laid siege to their opponents\u2019 goal in the final stages, even after defender Sergio Ramos was sent off, but couldn\u2019t find the goal that would have taken them through. Jose Mourinho\u2019s side complained bitterly to the referee after the match but the result is sure to intensify pressure on the Portuguese coach, who has been forced to deny press rumors he is set to leave the club in June. Is Mourinho finished at Madrid? \u201cYou sometimes score a goal without trying much for one, and we happened to fail to score from four or five of our chances,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cIt was easy to talk to my men during halftime. I had few things to change. Halftimes are short when your team isn\u2019t playing well; those ten minutes don\u2019t seem enough. I only needed one minute today because my team played very well in the first half. I told them to keep it up. \u201cMaybe Pep Guardiola congratulated us after winning last year\u2019s final because it was a clean match without any havoc. If you like I\u2019ll congratulate him for winning last week\u2019s match. I have no problem doing so. They deserved to win that game.\u201d Real had the first chance of the match inside 15 seconds as a mistake from Gerard Pique let Gonzalo Higuain in on goal but the Argentina striker fired wide with only Barca keeper Jose Manuel Pinto to beat. Higuain had another two chances to open the scoring but Pinto saved his close-range effort from Xabi Alonso\u2019s free kick, before blocking a shot after he had surrendered possession. Germany international Mesut Ozil then struck the bar with a fierce shot from 35 yards with Pinto beaten, before Ronaldo drew another save from Barca\u2019s reserve keeper. A melee ensued after Real midfielder Lassana Diarra brought down Argentina striker Lionel Messi and was fortunate not to receive a second yellow card. Real were made to pay for their profligacy when Messi ran at Real\u2019s defense and teed up substitute Pedro to score shortly before the break, and just minutes later Brazilian fullback Alves made it two with a thunderous drive into the top corner. In the second half Real came back at their opponents as Ronaldo rounded Pinto from Ozil\u2019s pass to make it 2-1 and when France international Benzema made it 2-2 with 18 minutes left Real sensed victory. They continued to pour forward after Ramos was shown a second yellow card but couldn\u2019t find the vital third goal. Barca\u2019s night was marred by an injury to Andres Iniesta, who has a suspected hamstring tear and was replaced by Pedro after half an hour. His fellow Spain midfielder Xavi celebrated his 32nd birthday by equaling Joan Segarra\u2019s Barca record of 31 appearances in Clasico matches.  Barcelona will now face either Valencia or Levante in the semifinals. The pair play Thursday, with Valencia 4-1 up from the first leg. In Wednesday\u2019s other tie, Athletic Bilbao sealed a clash with third division Mirandes in the final four after a 1-0 win at Mallorca sealed a 3-0 aggregate victory in an all-La Liga encounter. In England, Liverpool booked a League Cup final date with second division Cardiff after beating Premier League leaders Manchester City 3-2 on aggregate at Anfield. Trailing 1-0 from the first leg, Nigel De Jong brought City level on aggregate with a vicious long range drive before Steven Gerrard restored Liverpool\u2019s advantage from the penalty spot. Striker Edin Dzeko put City back on terms when he tapped in Aleksandar Kolarov\u2019s cross on 62 minutes before Wales forward Craig Bellamy equalized against his former club to make it 2-2 on the night and secure a 3-2 aggregate win. In Italy, two goals from Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani helped Napoli to knock out Italian Cup holders Inter Milan and reach the semifinals. Napoli will next face Siena, who beat Chievo Verona 1-0 thanks to Mattia Destro\u2019s goal."

        "content": "It is a noise that has become synonymous with watching top-level tennis \u2013 the sound of ear-splitting shrieks and grunts as star players battle against each other in a bid to claim the sport\u2019s biggest prizes. The yelps of three-time grand slam champion Maria Sharapova and world No. 3 Victoria Azarenka have been the source of much conversation this week at the Australian Open in Melbourne \u2013 the year\u2019s first grand slam.  It might reach a crescendo on Saturday when they meet in the women\u2019s final, with the No. 1 ranking also at stake. \u201cAbout Maria, I mean, what can I say?\u201d said eighth seed Agnieszka Radwanska in a press conference following her quarterfinal defeat to Belarus\u2019 Azarenka on Tuesday. \u201cFor sure that is pretty annoying and it\u2019s just too loud.\u201d Who will be 2012 Australian Open victors? Throughout her career \u2013 which has included reaching No. 1 in the world, a breakthrough win aged 17 at Wimbledon in 2004 and two further grand slam titles \u2013 Sharapova has been renowned for the volume of her on-court vocalizations.  \u201cI\u2019ve heard it a few times over my career,\u201d the 24-year-old Russian said. \u201cYou\u2019ve watched me grow up, you\u2019ve watched me play tennis.   \u201cI\u2019ve been the same over the course of my career.  No one important enough has told me to change or do something different.  \u201cRight now there is no rule change.  I don\u2019t hear that there will be one, so it doesn\u2019t really matter what my answer would be, would it?\u201d At present, there are no WTA Tour rules which directly prohibit grunting. Female tennis\u2019 governing body does, however, have regulations which outlaw hindrances. Rivals reunited: Kvitova faces Sharapova in semis An involuntary hindrance would cover a player\u2019s hat falling off, or a ball rolling from their pocket. In this instance, a let is called and the point is replayed. Any hindrance deemed deliberate by the umpire would result in the loss of a point.  Although the issue of grunting is not mentioned in the International Tennis Federation\u2019s 2012 rulebook, the WTA explained how they are attempting to coach the trait out of the next generation of players. \u201cEveryone who watches tennis knows grunting is a part of the game, and we are aware that some fans find it bothersome,\u201d read a WTA statement. \u201cWe are currently in the process of exploring how to reduce excessive grunting, especially for younger players just starting out, without adversely affecting players who have developed their game under the current training \u201cWe do believe that we need to address the concerns expressed by some fans and take a careful look at our rules and education policies.\u201d Switzerland\u2019s Martina Hingis retired in 2007 after a 13-year playing career which saw her claim five grand slam titles, including three successive Australian Open triumphs between 1997 and 1999. The former world No. 1, who is playing in the senior\u2019s event in Melbourne, said the noises were more irksome for fans and viewers and largely go unnoticed by players. Djokovic downplays injury scare ahead of Murray rematch But Hingis did admit to being baffled by some of the noises coming from the opposite end of the court. \u201cIt\u2019s just sometimes when they were stretching a little bit more, you\u2019re like: \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 The more they had to stretch the louder it got,\u201d the 31-year-old explained. \u201cOr sometimes it\u2019s like a heavy grunt and it\u2019s on the service line and the ball doesn\u2019t have any weight on it. But I think it\u2019s more of an issue with the spectators.\u201d Due to the volume and unique nature of world No. 3 Azarenka\u2019s screams, the Rod Laver Arena crowd took to mimicking her during a second round win over Australian Casey Dellacqua. \u201cOf course I hear it. I mean, I\u2019m not deaf,\u201d the 22-year-old joked. \u201cBut it\u2019s fine for me. I mean, I respect the crowd, whatever they do. I try to just be focused on my game.\u201d So, with the WTA focused on coaching grunting out of the next generation of talent, it looks as if opponents of Sharapova and Azarenka will have to put up with the deafening screams for the foreseeable future. Or start wearing ear plugs\u2026 "

But, as well as being teammates for their national side, the players also share another common bond \u2013 each one of them has fathered a child that suffers from mental health problems. The players say they suspect this is no coincidence, more a direct consequence of taking performance-enhancing drugs while playing for their country, without their knowledge or consent. Rashid Hanafi is a respected figure in Algerian sport. He is president of the Algerian Olympic Committee, but was once doctor for the national side.

But nonetheless, Russians were known in the late 1970s and early 1980s for their suspicious behavior on the sport field.\u201d Hanafi added: \u201cIt is not necessarily true that these drugs had a direct effect on the children, but if we look at the whole situation we\u2019ll find that most players\u2019 children have some mental issues.\u201d Rogov, who is no longer alive, led Algeria to a famous victory over West Germany at the 1982 World Cup. CNN\u2019s efforts to reach any doctors who worked with the Algerian team at that time proved unsuccessful. But could these players and their families merely be victims of coincidence?  Professor Richard Sharpe, a senior scientist at the Medical Research Council Human Reproductive Sciences Unit in Scotland, doubts that any performance-enhancing drug or steroid could be transferred to offspring in such a manner. \u201cIt is possible you can take a drug that would cause mutations of DNA and therefore result in children being born with disabilities,\u201d Sharpe told CNN. \u201cBut I think it is extremely unlikely that this would happen \u2013 and I know of no drugs or substances that would be used to enhance sporting prowess that could be transferred and therefore cause these abnormalities.\u201d Like Hanafi, none of the players can prove there is a direct link, but they want answers to what has happened to their children \u2013 and it is their words that are most poignant of all. Shoaib had three daughters who all suffered mental health problems, with one of them, he says, dying as a result of her condition. \u201cNobody can understand our suffering,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI am shocked because I never took drugs in my life \u2013 unless of course I was given them without our knowledge and that the Russian coaches knew it.\u201d He added: \u201cSome years later, I met with some of my former teammates and we discovered that we were all in the same situation: me, Qassi Al Saeed (his daughter), Larbas (a son), Jamal Manad (three sons) and Ben Sawlah (daughter). We all played at the same time, so we decided to make it public, and find out why.\u201d None of the players would elaborate on those mental issues, which is not uncommon given cultural taboos surrounding the issue in that part of the world. Larbas\u2019 son Bilas is now 12 years old. \u201cWhen he was born, I said, \u2018This is our fate, and we should accept it,\u2019 \u201d Larbas told CNN. \u201cIt did not come to my mind that this could be something related to drugs, until I met up with the other guys. \u201cI remember the Russian doctors who used to supervise our treatment during training sessions; all we cared about was playing and winning. I know it will be difficult to reveal the truth without sufficient evidence, but opening an investigation is very important.\u201d  Al Saeed also wants answers. \u201cI believe in fate, but having the same mental problem among everyone in the team is something very strange,\u201d he told CNN.  \u201cI don\u2019t understand what Dr. Hanafi said in terms of not allowing him to view the files, which means that a group of people were doing something in the dark, but we will not stop asking for our right to know.\u201d He added: \u201cMy second daughter, Madina, was born in 1989. When she reached school age, she said to me: \u2018Why can\u2019t I go to school like other girls?\u2019 I did not know what to say, so I held her and cried.  \u201cIs there anyone in this world who prefers money and fame and have some unhealthy children? I don\u2019t think so, so we need immediate answers from authorities. We know that reopening this case is difficult, but we need to know the reasons that made us reach this point.\u201d"

        "content": "World No. 2 Petra Kvitova and former No. 1 Maria Sharapova are set for a rematch of the 2011 Wimbledon final after both reached the last four of the Australian Open on Wednesday. The two players are battling to become the new top-ranked woman following Caroline Wozniacki\u2019s quarterfinal defeat by defending champion Kim Clijsters on Tuesday. Kvitova is the rising force in the female game after claiming her first major title with victory over Russia\u2019s three-time grand slam champion at the All England Club last July, and then winning the season-ending WTA Championships. The Czech booked her spot in the Melbourne semifinals with a 6-4 6-4 win over Italian surprise package Sara Errani, who has never previously been beyond the third round of a grand slam. A nervous Kvitova hit 22 unforced errors in the first set against the world No. 48 before triumphing in one hour and 51 minutes. By comparison, fourth seed Sharapova had a convincing 6-2 6-3 win against her 56th-ranked compatriot Ekaterina Makarova, who eliminated five-time champion Serena Williams in the fourth round. Kvitova said her win on the grass of Wimbledon will count for nothing ahead of Thursday\u2019s rematch on a hard-court surface. \u201cI think it was a really good match from both sides,\u201d the 21-year-old said of last year\u2019s clash. \u201cHow I can compare?  I can\u2019t because it was grass and here is the hard court. \u201cI mean, it will be similar match as the Wimbledon, but still it can be different.  But tactics will be the same as the Wimbledon.\u201d Sharapova is searching for a first grand slam title since her win in Melbourne four years ago, which followed her breakthrough success at Wimbledon as a 17-year-old in 2004 and her 2006 U.S. Open triumph. The 24-year-old has lost two of her three matches against Kvitova, including their last clash in Tokyo in September. \u201cI\u2019ve lost to her the last couple of times, obviously the big one in Wimbledon,\u201d she said. \u201cI think she is the one to beat right now.  \u201cShe\u2019s playing the best tennis in her career, coming off so many wins last year. I\u2019m looking forward to the match-up \u2013 I don\u2019t like losing so many times in a row, so I\u2019ll try my best.\u201d Thursday\u2019s other semifinal will pit third seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus \u2013 who can also claim the No. 1 ranking \u2013 against Belgian 11th seed Clijsters."

        "content": "A golden cape woven from the silk of 1.2 million Golden Orb spiders has gone on display at London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum. The richly-embroidered garment \u2013 its bright yellow hue is the natural color of the spider silk \u2013 is the result of a seven-year project on the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar. Using long poles, a team of 80 people worked to collect the spiders from their webs each day and harvest their silk before returning them to the wild. The project was the brainchild of American fashion designer Nicholas Godley and British art historian and textile expert Simon Peers, who have both lived in Madagascar for many years. \u201cThe idea of using spider silk to create garments goes back 300 years,\u201d Godley told CNN. \u201cThe last significant attempt to succeed was at the turn of the century, when a French Jesuit priest based in Madagascar, Jacob Paul Camboue, experimented with \u2018milking\u2019 spiders for their silk.\u201d Peers had long been intrigued by the idea, and on a visit to his office, Godley\u2019s imagination was sparked when he spotted an unusual-looking tool which Peers explained was for collecting silk from spiders. \u201cThe idea never died, we kept revisiting it over the years, and eventually I shut my handbag factory so we could build a proper \u2018spidery\u2019 and experiment with harnessing spiders and harvesting their silk. We found that it worked. \u201cWe were amazed \u2013 you stand there watching it happen and you start to question your sanity. Is this really happening, or have I lost my bananas? \u201cWe had 24 spiders harnessed up, the spindle was going, and silk was coming out. That was our eureka moment. We were over the moon, but it was just the beginning.\u201d Scaling the project up proved a huge challenge \u2013 only female Golden Orb spiders make silk. Hundreds of thousands of them were needed, and their cannibalistic nature meant the creatures had to be separated to prevent them from eating their neighbors. Godley admits that the properties of spider silk \u2013 and the practicalities and costs involved \u2013 mean that industrial-scale production for use in textiles is unlikely ever to succeed. \u201cFrom a fashion perspective, it\u2019s impractical,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural fiber, and it shrinks, so you can\u2019t wash or dry clean it, and obviously it is hugely expensive to produce, so how would you begin to price it?\u201d Instead, they simply wanted to prove that it could be done, and to create two items which could help revive traditional Malagasy weaving techniques and embroidery skills, and to showcase the talents of people working on the island. The four-meter-long brocade scarf, which was first shown at New York\u2019s Natural History Museum in 2009, was created using old Malagasy patterns, but as Godley explained, the inspiration for the cape, which made its debut at London\u2019s V&A Museum today, came from the spiders themselves. \u201cAfter we finished the scarf, we wondered what to make next, and I really liked the idea of a cape, because of the fact that spiders cocoon their prey, wrapping them up, and I was intrigued by the thought of being cocooned in spider silk.\u201d The cape is covered in images of spiders, plants and flowers, which took 6,000 hours to embroider, and those lucky enough to get up close have discovered that it is virtually weightless. \u201cWe do a party trick where we get people to close their eyes and we put the tassels from the cape in one of their hands and ask them to guess which hand it is in. Half of them have no clue, and the other half get it wrong \u2013 only a few guess, but only because of the warmth. \u201cThe cape itself is like an invisibility cloak, you almost wouldn\u2019t know you were wearing it, and it has this mystical, ephemeral quality, just like a spider\u2019s web, but also a permanence. \u201cA spiderweb is here today and gone tomorrow, but we have found a way to harness that and turn it into something lasting.\u201d But despite working so closely with them for so many years, Godley admits he is still afraid of spiders. \u201cI am fascinated by them, but still frightened of them: Spiders are poisonous, and they bite people,\u201d he said. \u201cI am slowly trying to overcome it, but it hasn\u2019t stopped.\u201d"

        "content": "On the day film lovers around the globe tuned in to find out this year\u2019s Oscar contenders, the world of cinema mourned the loss of one of its most respected figures. Greek award-winning film director Theo Angelopoulos died Tuesday night after suffering serious head injuries in a road accident in Athens, Greek media reported. The 77-year-old auteur, whose numerous accolades included a \u201cPalme d\u2019Or\u201d at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival for \u201cEternity and a Day\u201d was hit by a motorcycle while crossing a street near the set of his latest film, \u201cThe Other Sea.\u201d Renowned for his dreamlike sequences and slow narrative style, Angelopoulos worked with actors such as Harvey Keitel, Marcello Mastroianni,  Bruno Ganz and Jeanne Moreau in a career spanning over four decades. His critically-acclaimed films focused on issues such as war, immigration and politics, while his latest movie was reported to look at the economic troubles faced by many Greeks under the squeeze of the financial crisis. \u201cWe all owe him a huge \u2018thank you,\u2019\u201d Greek minister of culture and tourism Pavlos Yeroulanos said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cIn his case, the word \u2018irreplaceable\u2019 has real substance.\u201d Born in Athens in 1935, Angelopoulos moved to France in 1961 for cinema studies before returning to Greece where he first worked as film critic. He completed his first feature film, \u201cReconstruction,\u201d in 1970, which won awards in Greek and international film festivals.

        "content": "In his answers to prosecutors, defense attorneys and a judge, the captain of the ill-fated cruise ship Costa Concordia admitted he made a \u201cmistake\u201d in colliding with rocks off the Italian island of Giglio. However, in statements made during a phone conversation with a friend earlier this month, Capt. Francesco Schettino said managers pressured him to steer the ship to the area where the collision occurred, two Italian newspapers reported Wednesday. Both Costa Cruises and authorities have criticized Schettino\u2019s behavior. He is under house arrest and faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship when the vessel struck rocks and rolled over onto its side in the waters off the island on January 13. A 16th body was found Tuesday on the ship. Sixteen others are missing from the roughly 4,200 people aboard the cruise liner \u2013 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members \u2013 at the time of the collision. \u201cI hit this projection of rock, that seems almost stuck into the ship, but this was my mistake,\u201d Schettino said in the 126-page transcript. \u201c\u2026 There isn\u2019t anything I can say, as I was convinced that passing within .28 of a mile there wouldn\u2019t be any problem. The captain also brushed aside suggestions that at 15 knots, he was going too fast, as alleged by prosecutors. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a speed limit,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 We had more or less the speed needed to reach Savona on time.\u201d According to the transcript, Schettino maintained he ran the ship aground to keep it from sinking. \u201cThis is what allowed me to limit the tilting,\u201d he said. Maritime lawyer Jim Allsworth told CNN the maneuver is \u201cfairly standard\u201d in the case of a ship taking on water and in danger of sinking or capsizing. \u201cThe best thing to do is to put it aground to stop it sinking.\u201d Italian newspapers La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera on Wednesday published excerpts from a telephone conversation Schettino had with a friend after his January 14 arrest.  The captain called his friend from the prosecutor\u2019s office, and authorities tapped the phone, the newspapers said. Schettino attorney Alessandro Antichi confirmed the wiretap but would not comment on the conversation. The information should not have been published, he said, as it is part of the investigation. \u201cIn my place, someone else wouldn\u2019t have been so benevolent to have gone right under there, because they have pissed me off, go, go there,\u201d Schettino said, in an apparent reference to getting close to the island, according to the newspapers. \u201cThe shallows were there but it wasn\u2019t signaled by the instruments that I had and I went through \u2026 in order to follow what the managers wanted.\u201d The man behind the steering wheel, Jacob Rusli Bin, told investigators that after the ship struck the rocks, Schettino cursed and said he had not seen them, La Repubblica reported. Speaking Wednesday before the Italian Senate, Costa CEO Pier Luigi Foschi gave an account of what occurred as documented by Roberto Ferrarini, the company\u2019s director of marine operations. The first contact between Schettino and Ferrarini took place about 15 minutes after the collision, at 9:57 p.m. In the call, Schettino told Ferrarini of the crash and said the ship had lost power but assured him the ship could still navigate and the situation was being investigated. In subsequent calls, Foschi said, Schettino updated Ferrarini about the ship taking on water but insisted it could still navigate. Foschi told lawmakers that Ferrarini reported Schettino was calm during the calls. The last call in which the captain reported the situation was under control came in at 10:33 p.m., he said. Two minutes later, Schettino called to tell Ferrarini the ship was being evacuated, Foschi said, adding that Ferrarini was surprised at the sudden change.  Ferrarini and Schettino continued to talk during the evacuation, Foschi said, but did not provide further details. Costa cannot conduct an independent investigation because prosecutors seized the ship\u2019s data recorder, or \u201cblack box.\u201d The recorder had some connection problems but is working, Foschi said. It contains conversation recordings and navigation system data, he said. Schettino\u2019s defense attorney, Bruno Leporatti, filed an appeal Wednesday of a judge\u2019s decision to place the captain on house arrest, Leporatti\u2019s office said in a statement. Both the prosecution and the defense are appealing the decision \u2013 prosecutors because they believe Schettino should be in custody, and the defense because it believes he should have been released with no restrictions on his movements. In his deposition, Schettino defended his decision not to evacuate the ship immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I can have a black out and immediately say, \u2018Let\u2019s all get out of here,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cWhere do I send these people? I need to have the certainty and reach my decision on the fact that the ship is like that (no longer capable of floating). I am not going to put at risk the lives of 4,000 people.\u201d Cruise ship passengers described a scene of panic and confusion as they rushed for lifeboats. Some said the crew seemed overwhelmed and did not have accurate information on what was taking place.  In the transcript, Schettino also described the chaos, saying he helped passengers onto lifeboats and that some became stuck because of the angle of the listing ship. He said he was trying to launch a lifeboat when he realized he was no longer on board. \u201cI was then on the lifeboat. It isn\u2019t as if I had boarded it,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, I fell on its roof.\u201d However, in the wiretapped conversation, Schettino tells the friend, \u201cWhen I understood that the ship was tilting, I decided to leave, and left,\u201d according to Corriere della Sera. A captain\u2019s leaving the ship with passengers still aboard is difficult to defend, said Italian criminal defense attorney Ugo Meucci, who does not represent Schettino. \u201cThis is a very difficult position because our law is very strong, and the risk is very high for the captain,\u201d who could face a 15-year jail sentence, Meucci said.  Schettino has resolutely defended his actions after the ship hit the rocks, insisting he kept his bosses at Costa fully informed of the accident\u2019s severity. \u201cThe gash (in the ship) was immense,\u201d the captain said in the wiretapped conversation. \u201cThere was this projection of rock, and then all what I did afterwards, I did it with my most professionalism, and this can help me alleviate or at least give me the illusion to be at peace with my conscience.\u201d He tells the friend. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the fact that we saved almost all (the passengers). \u2026 I went around picking up people at sea and I\u2019m at peace.\u201d Schettino also tells the friend, \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to go back on ship.\u201d"

The press in Spain claim relations between the Portuguese coach and some of his Spanish players have been strained in the wake of their 2-1 defeat in the first leg of their \u201cEl Clasico\u201d clash last week. Mourinho was booed by a section of Real Madrid\u2019s fans during the 4-1 defeat of Athletic Bilbao in La Liga on Sunday, despite the team maintaining a five-point lead over Barca at the summit, and newspaper reports on Tuesday claimed he was going to leave his post in June. The former Chelsea and Inter coach was terse when questioned about the claims at a press conference, while the two players at the center of the speculation came out to back their manager. CNN Blog: Is Mourinho finished at Real Madrid? \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re leaders with a five-point lead on the team everyone says are the best in the world,\u201d Mourinho told reporters, in quotes carried by AFP. \u201cBefore I arrived here, the club was used to being knocked out of the Spanish Cup by teams from a lower division, and we won the competition last  season. \u201cAnd then we won six games out of six in the Champions League. So I think  we haven\u2019t got as many problems as people want to say.\u201d Mourinho\u2019s side have lost three of the four matches they have played against Barcelona this season, and his tactics were criticized in the wake of last week\u2019s 2-1 reverse at their own Bernabeu Stadium. Mourinho - fans booing doesn\u2019t bother me But the two players Mourinho is said to have fallen out with \u2013 Spain\u2019s World Cup-winning goalkeeper Iker Casillas and defender Sergio Ramos \u2013 backed their manager on Real\u2019s official website. \u201cOur relationship with the coach has always been good,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cMourinho is the ideal coach for this club and we\u2019re happy to learn from him.  \u201cHe is very experienced \u2013 he\u2019s won it all and is really bringing out the best in us so that each of us plays his best.\u201d Real captain Casillas added: \u201cI think I haven\u2019t seen such a great atmosphere on the team for a very long time. The atmosphere on the team is pleasant and excellent. Spirits are high. There is no reason to worry.\u201d Meanwhile, in the Spanish Cup quarterfinal played on Tuesday, third division Mirandes stunned Espanyol, who play in Spain\u2019s top flight, to go through to the last four. With Espanyol leading 3-2 after the first leg, Rui Fonte\u2019s goal seemed to kill off any chances of a shock but late goals from Pablo Infante and Cesar leveled the tie up at 4-4 on aggregate, sending lowly Mirandes through on away goals. In Italy, Juventus booked an Italian Cup semifinal with either Lazio or Milan after a convincing 3-0 win over AS Roma. Emanuele Giaccherini grabbed the first after just six minutes after being put through on goal before Juve legend Alessandro Del Piero made it two with a trademark strike, cutting inside and finding the top corner. Erik Lamela was sent off for Juve but that didn\u2019t stop Fabio Quagliarella from making it 3-0 late on. "

        "content": "World No. 2 Rafael Nadal and 16-time grand slam winner Roger Federer will face off for a place in the Australian Open final after the great tennis rivals won their last-eight ties on Tuesday. Four-time champion Federer reached his 30th grand slam semifinal with a 6-4 6-3 6-2 victory against Argentina\u2019s world No. 11 Juan Martin del Potro in the day\u2019s early match. Ten-time grand slam winner Nadal \u2013 who beat Federer in an epic 2009 final to claim his only Australian Open triumph \u2013 later earned a hard-fought victory over Czech seventh seed Tomas Berdych. The Spaniard came from behind to win 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (8-6) 6-4 6-3 in a grueling encounter which lasted over four hours. The two former world No. 1s have met in nine grand slam matches \u2013 eight of them finals following their initial encounter at the 2005 French Open semis. Nadal won that match and six of the others. He has won 17 of the pair\u2019s 26 overall matches, with their most recent clash being Federer\u2019s straight-sets win at last year\u2019s ATP World Tour Finals.

Okay, it doesn\u2019t allow a rematch for the final here, if (Andy) Murray were to play Novak (Djokovic). But I think it\u2019s good for tennis that it changes up a bit.\u201d Nadal said his 7-5 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 3-6 6-2 victory over Federer in 2009\u2019s showpiece match was an \u201cunforgettable\u201d experience. \u201cSeriously, that final is one of the memories that will always be in my mind,\u201d the 25-year-old told reporters. He said Federer, who has yet to drop a set during the tournament, would be favorite on the hard-court surface. \u201cHe\u2019s doing well and he\u2019s playing fantastic, and he had a fantastic end of the season last year.  So he\u2019s coming with confidence. It will be a very, very difficult match for me,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cAlways playing in these kind of surfaces, he\u2019s the favorite. His level is fantastic, and he won today a fantastic match against one of the best players of the world, Del Potro.  So he\u2019s doing very, very well.\u201d The other semifinal could see a rematch between defending champion Novak Djokovic and 2011 runner-up Andy Murray. World No. 1 Djokovic plays Spain\u2019s fifth seed David Ferrer on Wednesday, while No. 4 Murray \u2013 also a losing finalist in 2010 \u2013 faces Japanese surprise package Kei Nishikori."

        "content": "Caroline Wozniacki\u2019s quest for a first grand slam title and her reign as world No. 1 both ended on Tuesday after a quarterfinal defeat by defending champion Kim Clijsters at the Australian Open. Four-time grand slam winner Clijsters showed little sign of being hampered by the ankle injury she sustained during her fourth-round win against last year\u2019s runner-up Li Na as she won 6-3 7-6 (7-4) in one hour and 45 minutes. Wozniacki finished the last two seasons top of the world rankings and has been No. 1 seed for the last six majors. However, the 21-year-old Dane is now certain to fall below No. 2 Petra Kvitova and No. 3 Victoria Azarenka \u2013 who is Clijsters\u2019 semifinal opponent on Thursday. Fourth seed Maria Sharapova, who plays fellow Russian Ekatarina Makarova in the last eight on Wednesday, could also take top spot \u2013 a position she, like Clijsters, has held before. \u201cKim is very experienced,\u201d Wozniacki, who was beaten by Clijsters in her only grand slam final at the 2009 U.S. Open, told reporters.  \u201cI mean, she\u2019s a great player. Of course I really don\u2019t like losing.  I try to go in and try to win every time I play, but today Kim was just that little bit better than me.\u201d Wozniacki, who could slip to No. 4 in the world depending on Sharapova\u2019s results, insisted she is not concerned about losing her top ranking. \u201cI start laughing every time because the media talks to me like I\u2019m finishing my career and I only have one year left and time is running out,\u201d she said.  \u201cI still have a number of Australian Opens and a number of U.S. Opens and Wimbledons and French Opens left. \u201cIn the end of the day, you can just do your best.  You can\u2019t do anything more than that. If your best is good enough, that\u2019s great.  If not, then it\u2019s just too good from the other person. I will come back not only once but more times.\u201d Clijsters saved four match points in her victory over 2011 French Open champion Li and the Belgian looked as if she might be set for another struggle after letting a 5-2 lead slip in the second set. But the three-time U.S. Open winner rallied to take control of the tie break and advance to her seventh Australian Open semifinal as she beat a No. 1 for the first time in a grand slam. Having taken more than two years to win her first major title after first reaching the top of the world rankings, the current world No. 14 can sympathize with Wozniacki\u2019s plight. \u201cShe\u2019s worked very hard to get to where she is, and she\u2019s one of the most consistent players. People are almost in a way almost blaming her for it. I think that\u2019s something that is really absurd,\u201d Clijsters said. \u201cI think it\u2019s all a matter of experience and improving, definitely improving and trying to learn from losses and become better every slam. Then she will definitely get there.\u201d Eleventh seed Clijsters said she had gone to great lengths to ensure her ankle was ready. \u201cInstead of really focusing on the match you\u2019re focusing on trying to get the ankle as good as possible,\u201d the 28-year-old said.  \u201cLaying on the couch, every 20 minutes ice, 20 minutes off, 20 minutes ice, 20 minutes off.  Leg elevated.  Lymphatic drainage, all that stuff.   \u201cI had a light hit yesterday without really sidewards movement, just trying to get a feel for the ball, and then back to the icing and all that same routine all over again.\u201d Azarenka earlier came from behind against Polish eighth seed Agnieszka Radwanska before winning 6-7 (0-7) 6-0 6-2. It was the 22-year-old\u2019s 18th victory in her last 21 matches. \u201cIt was very important to see how I could adjust after not playing really well in the first set,\u201d said the Belorussian, whose only previous grand slam semifinal came at Wimbledon last year.  \u201cI completely turned it around, so I\u2019m really, really happy about that. Maybe two years ago I would be like, \u2018Okay it\u2019s not working today.\u2019  \u201cBut today I really tried to forget about the first set and start from zero and really fight hard, take it one at a time and keep going.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s quarterfinals pit the Czech Republic\u2019s Kvitova against Italian world No. 48 Sara Errani and 2008 champion Sharapova against 56th-ranked Makarova \u2013 who beat five-time Australian Open winner Serena Williams in the fourth round."

        "content": "Australia will follow the European Union\u2019s lead in imposing sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil imports, Foreign Secretary Kevin Rudd said Tuesday in London, amid international concern over Tehran\u2019s nuclear ambitions. The European Union announced Monday it would cut off oil imports from Iran and freeze assets in an effort to starve the country\u2019s nuclear program of funding. Rudd, speaking after a meeting of British and Australian foreign and defense officials, said Australia was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about Iran and would impose parallel measures to those announced in Brussels. \u201cWe believe this is the right course of action,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that for the simple reason that the Iranian nuclear weapons program is fundamentally destabilizing, not just for the wider Middle East and the Gulf states, but also for the wider world.\u201d The sanctions announced Monday freeze the assets of Iran\u2019s central bank in European Union nations and ban the importation of Iranian oil to those countries. The measures also block European Union countries from exporting petrochemical equipment and technology to Iran, or trading diamonds and precious metals with the Middle Eastern state. Iran says its nuclear program is not military, but the United States and many of its allies suspect Iran intends to produce a bomb. The United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has expressed similar concerns. British Foreign Secretary William Hague, speaking alongside Rudd, said the measures represented \u201ca significant increase \u2013 a major increase \u2013 in the peaceful, legitimate pressure on the Iranian government to return to negotiations over its nuclear program. \u201cUntil it does so, the pressure will only increase and Britain and Australia share the same sense of resolve about that,\u201d Hague added. Rudd said the reason for such concerted action was clear.  \u201cThe message needs to be delivered to the people of Iran, the wider political elites of Iran, as well as the government of Iran, that their behavior is globally unacceptable,\u201d he said. Tehran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, the only outlet to and from the Persian Gulf, in response to sanctions \u2013 a move that has increased international tensions.  Seventeen million barrels of oil per day passed through the critical shipping lane in 2011, according to the Energy Information Administration. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said Tuesday that Britain had sent the British warship HMS Argyll through the strait alongside U.S. and French ships Sunday \u201cto send a clear signal about the resolve of the international community to defend the right of free passage through international waters.\u201d Britain also has vessels in the Gulf equipped to counter the laying of mines, he said, as part of the allied presence in the area. \u201cThe United Kingdom has a contingent capability to reinforce that presence, should at any time it be considered necessary to do so,\u201d he warned. Later Tuesday, Hague told lawmakers in the House of Commons that Iran would be the biggest loser if it followed through on its threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, since 95% of its own oil exports pass through it. Hague said the passage of HMS Argyll through the strait had been a routine movement but reflected the \u201cunwavering international commitment\u201d to keeping it open. \u201cAny attempt by Iran to block the Strait would be both illegal and unsuccessful,\u201d he said, adding that the point of the sanctions was to bring Iran back to the negotiating table. Iran\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Abbas Aragchi, said Monday that the measures against it would only harm the fragile economies of the European Union, according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. \u201cSanctions have proved ineffective in the past and will prove futile in the future, too,\u201d IRNA quoted Aragchi as saying. Iran exports 2.2. million barrels of oil a day, with about 18% bound for European markets, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Iranian government gets about half its revenue from oil exports, according to the agency.  The world consumes about 89 million barrels of oil per day.  Rudd said Australian imports of Iranian oil were currently \u201cnegligible,\u201d while his country\u2019s exports to Iran had already declined greatly in recent years in line with foreign policy concerns. \u201cThis costs, but is a cost worth paying,\u201d he said. Analysts have said that while the new sanctions are the toughest ever imposed, they still contain many loopholes. Iran is expected to still be able to sell its oil to places like China, India or other Asian countries, but perhaps at a discount of 10% to 15%. About 35% of Iran\u2019s oil exports currently go to China and India. The European Union will allow contracts that are already in place to be fulfilled until July 1, it said. The U.S. government took its own punitive action regarding Iran Monday, with the Treasury Department targeting the nation\u2019s third-largest bank, the state-owned Bank Tejarat, for allegedly working with other Iranian banks and firms subject to sanctions tied to Iran\u2019s nuclear program."

        "content": "Turkey is reacting angrily Tuesday to the French Senate\u2019s approval of a law criminalizing the denial of genocide, including that of the Armenians at the end of the Ottoman Empire. \u201cGuillotine to History\u201d and \u201cGuillotine to Thought,\u201d blared the front pages of two Turkish newspapers.  \u201cHe massacred democracy,\u201d announced another newspaper, Hurriyet, next to a front-page photo of French President Nicolas Sarkozy. In the run-up to Monday\u2019s late-night vote in the French Senate, the Turkish government made no secret it was vehemently opposed to the French law, warning it could cause permanent harm to Franco-Turkish relations. The Turkish foreign ministry put out a pre-dawn statement condemning the law Tuesday.  Later, however, Turkey\u2019s hot-tempered prime minister surprised some observers, when he called for a \u201cperiod of patience\u201d in a televised speech. \u201cA mistake was made\u2026 history cannot be judged or written by parliaments,\u201d said Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in remarks before lawmakers from his ruling political party.   Denouncing the French law as racist and a \u201cmassacre of freedom of thought,\u201d Erdogan added, \u201cWe have not lost our hope yet that this mistake can be corrected.\u201d The Turkish leader said his government would lobby for a petition of 60 French lawmaker signatures to block the law in France\u2019s Constitutional Council. According to the French legislation, \u201cthose who have publicly denied or trivialized crimes of genocide,\u201d can face a year in prison and/or a 45,000-euro fine. The law does not specifically mention the World War I massacre of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Armenians by Ottoman Turks.  But most of the seven-hour debate in the French Senate Monday focused on the memory of the Armenian genocide. Within minutes of the 127-86 vote in favor of the law in Paris, Armenia\u2019s foreign minister issued a statement of gratitude that declared France \u201ca genuine defender of universal human values.\u201d \u201cThis day will be written in gold,\u201d wrote Edward Nalbandian. Every year, Armenians around the world commemorate the 1915 slaughter of more than 1.2 million ethnic Armenians. The Turkish government rejects the term \u201cgenocide\u201d to refer to this dark and bloody chapter of history.  Many Turkish politicians and historians argue Muslim Turks were also massacred by Armenian militias in the final days of the Ottoman Empire. Instead, Ankara expends significant political capital and issues threats in an attempt to block initiatives in the U.S. Congress to formally term the killings of Armenians as \u201cgenocide.\u201d  The United Nations defines genocide as the killing of, injuring of, or displacing of members of a national, ethnic, racial or religious group with the intent to destroy the group.   After the French lower house of parliament passed the genocide law in December, Turkey temporarily withdrew its ambassador from Paris and suspended military ties with France. Turkish politicians have warned of further sanctions against France if Sarkozy allows the new law to go into effect. But in an interview with CNN Monday, the head of the Turkish parliament\u2019s foreign affairs committee deliberately avoided saying what those measures might be. \u201cThere\u2019s always ambiguity in politics and diplomacy,\u201d said Volkan Bozkir.  \u201cThere will be some (measures)\u2026 which will hurt France more than Turkey,\u201d he warned. Turkey and France enjoyed more than $14 billion in bilateral trade last year.  They are also partners in the NATO military alliance. "

        "content": "Spain\u2019s best-known judge, Baltasar Garzon, went on trial Tuesday in Madrid for the second time in two weeks, accused of abusing his judicial authority during his investigation of human rights abuses under the former dictatorship of Spain\u2019s Francisco Franco. A seven-judge panel at Spain\u2019s Supreme Court is hearing the case, a week after a different seven-judge panel at the same court conducted the first trial against Garzon, for allegedly abusing his judicial authority in a financial corruption case. Garzon, 56, was suspended from his post in 2010, pending these trials. If convicted, he would not go to jail but could lose his right permanently to be a judge in Spain.  Many observers said the second trial is the most important against Garzon, who became known internationally in 1998 when he sought the extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, who was in a London hospital. Garzon accused him of the murder of Spaniards in Chile and crimes of genocide. Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch said the trial against Garzon for his Franco investigation \u201cis the first time in a consolidated democracy\u201d and in the European Union that a judge \u201cis indicted for investigating human rights abuses.\u201d \u201cGarzon is being tried for trying to apply in Spain the same principles he applied internationally. A democracy needs judges who aren\u2019t afraid,\u201d Brody told a news conference in Madrid on Monday, flanked by other international observers who are attending the trial. In both cases, state prosecutors have asked that all charges be dropped. But under Spanish law, a private prosecution is also allowed and it is the lawyers for these parties that are pressing the charges against Garzon. Last week\u2019s trial in the so-called Gurtel financial and political corruption case lasted three days and the seven-judge panel must now determine a verdict. In the case Tuesday involving the Franco regime, a small civil servants union called Manos Limpias, or Clean Hands, brought charges against Garzon, saying he ignored a 1977 amnesty law approved in Spanish parliament, two years after Franco\u2019s death. \u201cParliament unanimously approved the amnesty law. Judge Baltasar Garzon takes a stance as if they\u2019re crazy. What does he think? That he\u2019s better than them?\u201d said Miguel Bernard, leader of Manos Limpias. Bernard denies critics\u2019 charges that his group is a tiny far-right front, but he told CNN he was proud to receive an honor just last month from the Francisco Franco Foundation. Garzon said in May 2010, at the time of his suspension from his post as investigating magistrate at the National Court, \u201cI face this calmly, with the tranquility of knowing that I am innocent of these charges.\u201d Franco\u2019s military uprising in 1936 triggered the three-year Spanish Civil War. The war ended when Franco\u2019s forces emerged victorious over Republican and leftist fighters. Franco\u2019s dictatorship continued until his death in 1975. Mass graves from the regime are still being unearthed. Just outside the courtroom on Tuesday before the proceedings began, Garzon told CNN he is \u201cokay\u201d as he heads into this second trial. He talked with his lawyers and supporters, smiled broadly and appeared relaxed. Outside the courthouse, several hundred people demonstrated in favor of Garzon, a far larger crowd than at the start of last week\u2019s trial. Inside the ornate 18th-century Supreme Court building, various people, still looking for the remains of their relatives in mass graves from the Franco regime, filed into the courtroom, right next to Bernard of Manos Limpias. But the two opposing groups apparently did not recognize each other, and there were no apparent verbal exchanges. The trial opened with preliminary issues, in which Garzon\u2019s defense lawyer called for the case to be thrown out. Among the questions was whether a case like this could go forward when not the state prosecutor but only a private prosecution is bringing the charges. In the financial corruption case that Garzon was investigating, and which still has ongoing trials against defendants in various parts of Spain, Garzon ordered electronic surveillance against some defendants being held in jail, and some of their conversations were with their lawyers. These lawyers later filed charges against Garzon, saying he had overstepped his judicial authority in ordering the wiretaps on their conversations in prison and also violated their constitutional rights. During the trial, Garzon said his orders did not breach their attorney-client privilege and that the electronic surveillance was supported by prosecutors. It was done, Garzon said, on suspicion that the defendants in the corruption scandal were engaged in money laundering, even while they were in preventative prison. Lawyers for the financial corruption defendants called on the court to clearly delimit how far a judge could go in investigating alleged crimes. Garzon spent 22 years as an investigating magistrate at the National Court, which handles cases of terrorism and other delicate cases. He has investigated the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, the Basque terrorist group ETA, and drug traffickers. At times in the past, Garzon has been considered a darling of the Spanish right or the Spanish left, depending on the cases he was investigating. His critics say he is too flamboyant and grandstands in front of the cameras.  Since his suspension in 2010, Garzon has been working as a legal adviser outside of Spain on human rights cases and judicial issues, including in Latin America. A third case against Garzon, for alleged judicial improprieties linked to his organization of some courses at New York University that had major Spanish corporations as sponsors, is still in the investigation phase and no trial date has been set.  In that case as well, Spanish prosecutors have not pressed charges but a private prosecution has.  "

        "content": "Rescuers searching the stricken Costa Concordia found a body on bridge 3 Tuesday, bringing the number of confirmed dead from the wreck to 16, civil protection officials said. The discovery leaves about 16 people still missing from among the roughly 4,200 aboard the cruise liner \u2013 about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members \u2013 at the time of the collision with rocks off the island of Giglio. The vast majority fled the ship safely, if under chaotic and frightening conditions, according to survivors. Undersea salvage experts will not start siphoning fuel off the partially sunken liner before Saturday, the man in charge of the operation said Tuesday. Teams of divers have begun to set up the operation, Franco Gabrielli said in remarks televised from Giglio. His comments appear to contradict a timetable laid out Monday by an Italian admiral, who said that salvage workers were to begin pumping fuel out of the liner that day.   Adm. Ilarione Dell\u2019Anna said it would take 28 working days to remove all the fuel from the ship.   Gabrielli did not explain the discrepancy. He has asked the company that owns the ship to come up with a plan to clean up pollution from the vessel, such as garbage, by Wednesday, he said. The search for survivors and victims will continue alongside the salvage, said Gabrielli. The man in charge of the rescue operation said the divers faced a grim task. \u201cImagine that you left for holidays and that the power went off in your house. What would you find in your fridge? The divers are in there,\u201d Ennio Aquilino said. Two bodies were found on Monday, and two more over the weekend \u2013 one woman on Saturday and one on Sunday, both wearing life jackets. Divers used explosives Monday morning to blow more holes in the side of the ship to allow easier access. The parties involved in the rescue told reporters and residents on the island Sunday that search and rescue efforts will continue \u2013 but that the environmental risk is also becoming urgent. Officials said they cannot predict how long it will take to clear the wreckage, since that depends on maritime conditions and technical difficulties, but all legal, environmental and human factors will be taken into account. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Italy to show it can do something right and do it well,\u201d said Gabrielli. He warned that the task ahead was complicated and daunting, not least because it takes about 45 minutes to search each cabin, using special cameras and divers. The giant Costa Concordia had 1,500 cabins on board. A class-action lawsuit will be filed in Miami against Costa and its parent company, Carnival Corp., the Italian consumer group Codacons said Saturday. The suit, in collaboration with two U.S. law firms, is \u201caimed specifically at getting compensation for all damages to the boat passengers,\u201d Codacons said in a statement. The class-action suit is open to passengers of any nationality, it said.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been contacted by hundreds of victims and the numbers are growing moment by moment,\u201d said Mitchell Proner, senior partner at Proner & Proner, one of two firms involved. He said crew members have also contacted the firm, \u201cand their stories that are coming in are horrific \u2013 from lifeboats that were stuck halfway, passengers debating whether to jump or not.  This was not an orderly evacuation.\u201d The suit, he said, will request at least 125,000 euros (about $160,000) per passenger.  The suit has not yet been filed, said Marc Bern, senior partner at the other firm, Napoli Bern Ripka Shkolnik, but \u201cit will probably be in the billions of euros and dollars.\u201d \u201cThe sheer terror of being on a ship of that magnitude going down, you can imagine the psychological damage,\u201d Bern said. Meanwhile, Gabrielli said no fuel oil had yet leaked from the ship \u2013 only kitchen and engine oil \u2013 and that he did not see an immediate risk of the 2,400 tons on board escaping. Booms have been put in place around the ship to stop the spread of oil and other pollutants such as detergents and sewage chemicals. With more than 4,000 people aboard, the ship was the size of a small town, Gabrielli said. Fuel will be replaced with water as it is removed from the ship\u2019s tanks, keeping the ship balanced, said Dell\u2019Anna, head of coastal authorities for the port city of Livorno.  Gabrielli said Costa Cruises, the company that owns the cruise ship, is cooperative and was proving responsible, despite past errors. Both Costa Cruises and authorities have criticized Capt. Francesco Schettino, who is under house arrest and faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship. Prosecutors have accused the captain of piloting the ship too fast to allow him to react to dangers, causing the shipwreck, according to legal papers.  Schettino maintains his innocence."

        "content": "Former world number one Tiger Woods says he is in his best shape for a decade on the eve of his first golf tournament of 2012. The 14-time major winner is in the United Arab Emirates to participate in the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship, hoping to put a disappointing 2011 behind him. Woods did win the Chevron World Challenge at the end of last year but it was his own tournament and a limited, invitation-only field. The last time he won an event with a full field was in November 2009. But after injuries compounded his performances over the past 12 months,  the American insists he is fighting fit and raring to go when the tournament tees-off Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite a few  years since I\u2019ve been physically fit,\u201d Woods said in quotes carried by AFP. \u201cSo I\u2019m looking forward to getting out there and then playing and give it a  full season, which I haven\u2019t done in a while. \u201cI don\u2019t know, probably eight, 10, 12 years ago was the last time I felt  fully fit. I had surgery in 2002. I had surgery in 2008. A couple other ones in there, too. It\u2019s been a while. \u201cI played really well my last three events, so I\u2019m really looking forward  to this year, and continuing and building on what we have done towards the end  of last year for sure.\u201d The Abu Dhabi tournament boasts a strong line-up with golf\u2019s top four players in attendance.  English duo Luke Donald and Lee Westwood, ranked one and two in the world respectively, are joined by 2011 U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy, from Northern Ireland, and Germany\u2019s 2010 PGA Championship winner Martin Kaymer. Woods, who will play his first two rounds alongside world No. 3 McIlroy, rejects the idea the end of last season came at the wrong time. The 35-year-old showed glimpses of his best form at the Presidents Cup in Australia before taking the Chevron title. \u201cBecause I spent quite a bit of energy getting ready for those events, I really did need to take a break,\u201d he said. \u201cJust kind of more mentally than anything, just get away from the game,  because I was working hard and just trying to get my game peaking for those  events. \u201cSince I was not able to get ready for the major championship season last  year, I kind of spent a lot of my energy getting ready for those three events, and turned out to be pretty good.\u201d Woods also admitted that one of his reasons for taking part in Abu Dhabi was down to the appearance money on offer. \u201cI\u2019d have to say yes, it certainly does.,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons why a lot of the guys who play in Europe, they do play in Europe, and they do get  paid. I think the only Tour that doesn\u2019t pay is the U.S. Tour.\u201d"

Boc\u2019s announcement was made during a special parliamentary session held by the government and opposition leaders on the situation in Romania following 11 days of protests.  On Monday, hundreds of demonstrators continued to protest in Bucharest and other cities around the country, but no major violence was reported. More protests are expected in coming days. Protesters have called on President Traian Basescu to step down and for the government to resign. Demonstrators, who carry banners reading, \u201cWhat are we going to eat, Basescu?\u201d \u201cDown with the Government\u201d and \u201cLiberty,\u201d say they are living in poor conditions, have no jobs and are struggling to face a corrupted system. People blame the government for imposing harsh austerity measures after the country received 20 billion euros from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union.  Last week, the United States called on the Romanian people and leaders to avoid any violence during the anti-government protests.  \u201cWhat we would say to Romania and Romanians is the same thing that we say to others around the world and what we said to Greece and Greeks at the time, which is that we support the right of people around the world to protest and express their views peacefully, but we call on both protestors and authorities to refrain from any violence,\u201d U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said.   Boc announced the dismissal of his foreign minister by saying, \u201cI apologize for the statements that some of my colleagues recently made. I have decided to dismiss the foreign minister, Teodor Baconschi. I also forwarded a proposal to the president to replace him, following the comments he made on the protesters.\u201d Baconschi, a member of Romania\u2019s Liberal- Democrat party, was appointed foreign minister in 2009, after being Romania\u2019s ambassador to the Vatican and France.  Opposition leaders continued Monday to ask for early elections and the government\u2019s resignation during the special parliamentary session. Boc refused the opposition proposals, saying, \u201cOur main priority now is to maintain the country\u2019s credibility and economic stability.\u201d Government leaders asked for the special parliamentary session involving opposition leaders to continue on Tuesday, but the opposition leaders refused. Opposition leader Victor Ponta of the Social Democrats called on  Basescu to hold a speech in parliament on the country\u2019s current situation and his government\u2019s plans. So far, Basescu has not commented publicly on the protests. Ponta declared: \u201cOur suggestion is to make a political agreement for early elections \u2013 an agreement which states that we are ready to resign from parliament. The opposition (members of parliament) are ready to ask for people\u2019s vote. We are not giving up. The opposition MPs won\u2019t be in the parliament in February.\u201d Opposition liberal leader Crin Antonescu announced his party members will resign from parliament until early elections are held. He called on his opposition partners to do the same.  Protesters were joined Monday by a Romanian army officer who said he was showing his support for demonstrators in the streets. \u201cI am here to express my public disagreement for the way in which these ordinary people were insulted,\u201d Lt. Alexandru Gheorghe said.  \u201cMy brothers, my mother, my father, my grandparents, they have all gathered here. I saw old people beaten and said to myself that we, the officers, who could die tomorrow in a mission in Afghanistan, must have the courage to fight and tell the truth here in our country.\u201d The officer added, \u201cI am not against President Basescu. Legally speaking, he is my supreme leader.\u201d"

        "content": "Joint host nation Gabon opened their Africa Cup of Nations campaign with a comfortable 2-0 Group C victory over Niger at the newly-built L\u2019Amitie stadium in Libreville. Gabon were always in control against a Niger side making their finals debut  \u2013 and they deservedly took the lead after half an hour.  Stephane Nguema produced a superb cross from the right and Saint-Etienne striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang headed home from a tight angle. And they doubled that advantage on the stroke of half-time when Nguema nodded in from close range after Aubameyang\u2019s own header was only parried by the goalkeeper. Gabon\u2019s German coach Gernot Rohr told reporters: \u201cWe won and we played well, but more difficult teams than Niger lie ahead for us.  \u201cI hope we can continue on this path. I\u2019m pleased as we didn\u2019t concede a  goal, didn\u2019t pick up any injuries, and only got one booking,\u201d he added. The 40,000 capacity stadium also hosted the second group C encounter, with Tunisia beating north African neighbors Morocco 2-1. Tunisia defeated their rivals in the 2004 Africa Cup of Nations final \u2013 and they once again had bragging rights thanks to goals in either half from Khaled Korbi and Youssef Msakni. Tunisia nearly took the lead on the half hour mark when Zouhaier Dhaouadi\u2019s long-range effort smacked the post. However, just four minutes later, Morocco were finally undone when Korbi\u2019s dipping free-kick evaded the defensive wall and went in off the upright. And Tunisia doubled their lead 15 minutes from time when substitute Msakni evaded two challenges to score his first goal for his country. Houssine Kharja pulled a late goal back when he converted Ahmed Kantari\u2019s cross \u2013 although Kantari appeared off-side when receiving the ball. And Morocco nearly snatched an unlikely equalizer when Fiorentina midfielder Kharja\u2019s effort shaved the crossbar.       "

        "content": "Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho has brushed aside the boos he received from his own fans during the weekend\u2019s 4-1 victory over Athletic Bilbao. Mourinho has been the subject of criticism in the Spanish media following his side\u2019s display in the El Clasico Spanish Cup defeat by Barcelona last week. And reports of training bust-ups with Spanish internationals Iker Casillas and Sergio Ramos, which were widely reported in the Marca newspaper, have intensified the pressure on Mourinho \u2013 despite his side holding a five-point lead over champions Barca at the top of the La Liga table. But Mourinho told the official Real Madrid website that such reports do not bother him \u2013 neither does any dissatisfaction from the Bernabeu crowd. \u201cI\u2019m not bothered by the crowd booing me. It\u2019s the first time it\u2019s ever happened to me, but there is a first time for practically everything.  \u201cZinedine Zidane was booed at here and so has Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo was the Golden Boot winner, so if he can be booed, why can\u2019t I?\u201d Mourinho continued: \u201cThere have been no problems with the team this week. I lost a match on Wednesday, but I was already thinking about the Bilbao game on Friday. We played it and won, so that\u2019s it. I\u2019m a football professional who tries to defend Real Madrid with dignity and in full use of my capabilities. \u201cReal Madrid asked me to coach the team and I have a fantastic relationship with the president, director general and the board.  \u201cThey know they\u2019ll never have a problem with me. I\u2019m calm and just do my job,\u201d added Mourinho."

The Federation Internationale de l\u2019Automobile (FIA) took the decision to ban reactive ride-height systems for the 2012 season,  with teams such as Ferrari, Mercedes, Williams and Lotus thought to be developing their own versions of the innovation. F1\u2019s official website reported on Monday that the FIA informed the 12 teams of its decision to ban the technology \u2013 which helps stop the car dipping closer to the track under the pressure of braking \u2013 last week. Lotus\u2019 system first came to light at November\u2019s young driver test event, with the FIA initially approving the technology as it did not involve the direct input of the driver. \u201cWe have been investigating that type of system for a while,\u201d Williams\u2019 chief operations engineer Mark Gillan told the Flying Lap webcast. \u201cIt obviously has an impact on the aero platform of the car. Anything that gets the front ride height lower is beneficial from an aerodynamic perspective.\u201d Elsewhere, 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen drove an F1 car for the first time since 2009 at a private test event in Valencia, Spain on Monday. The Finn had his first taste of driving for the rebranded Lotus team, formerly Renault, in their 2010 car. Raikkonen won the drivers\u2019 championship with Ferrari five years ago, having also raced for the British marque McLaren and Switzerland-based Sauber. The 32-year-old raced in the World Rally Championship and NASCAR during his time away from F1. Raikkonen will take to the grid for the first time since the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in November 2009 when the 2012 season begins in Australia on March 18."

Nishikori, ranked 26th in the world, blew a two-set lead before beating the Frenchman for the second time in his career, triumphing 2-6 6-2 6-1 3-6 6-3 in three and a half hours. The 22-year-old, who will next face world No. 4 Andy Murray, beat his previous best grand slam performance \u2013 reaching the fourth round of the 2008 U.S. Open. He is the first Japanese male player to reach the last eight of one of the four majors since Shuzo Matsuoka at Wimbledon in 1995. \u201cThis is the first quarterfinal for me,\u201d an exhausted Nishikori, told reporters after his second successive five-set match.  \u201cI feel I\u2019m stepping up. It was tough because he was still playing well in the fifth. I was having trouble with making returns. I started getting nervous \u2026 But still I was playing aggressive on important points. I was making good serves. So that helped me to get the games.\u201d Nishikori beat world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the Basel semis in October before losing to Roger Federer, having learned a lesson in his thrashing by Murray in the last four in Shanghai in his preceding tournament. \u201cHe kind of destroyed me. But I have no pressure now. He\u2019s one of the players I have to play like him. I learn a lot of things from him. It\u2019s going to be tough, but I try to do my best tennis.\u201d Nishikori said he hoped he could inspire Asian men\u2019s players, as China\u2019s Li Na did for the region\u2019s women last year by reaching the Australian Open final and then winning the French Open. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to make a lot of histories, to be the No. 1 player in Japan.  But that never gives me pressure,\u201d said Nishikori, who is a graduate of the Nick Bollettieri academy in Florida which has produced many top players such as Andre Agassi, the Williams sisters and Maria Sharapova.. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good players in Asia.  But, yeah, I\u2019m happy to get to the top from Asia, and hopefully I can be like Li Na for the men.\u201d Fourth seed Murray, the runner-up in Melbourne for the last two years, was coasting 6-1 6-1 1-0 against Kazakhstan\u2019s Mikhail Kukushkin when the world No. 92 was forced to retire with a left hip flexor injury. \u201cI\u2019ll definitely be fresh for the next few rounds hopefully,\u201d said Murray, who has yet to win a first grand slam title despite reaching four finals. \u201cI just need to make sure I do the right things the next couple days to get ready for the quarters.\u201d Top seed and defending champion Novak Djokovic survived a spirited third-set fightback from former world No. 1 and home-crowd favorite Lleyton Hewitt to seal a  6-1 6-3 4-6 6-3 triumph in the late match. Hewitt, granted a wildcard for the tournament after a long fitness struggle has seen him dropped to 181st in the rankings, showed glimpses of the form which took him to two grand slam titles. But Djokovic \u2013 a four-time grand slam winner including three major titles in 2011 \u2013 eventually proved too strong and the Serbian world No. 1 eventually saw off the 30-year-old Hewitt in just under three hours in a match that went past 1 a.m. local time. \u201cI played some loose points and got him back into the match.  But credit to him as well for being competitive, for not giving up,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cThis is something you can expect from Lleyton who is very well-known for his fighting spirit. He had the crowd, he had the big support.  It got intense. Especially the start of the fourth set we had some great rallies.\u201d Fifth seed David Ferrer awaits Djokovic in the next round after the Spaniard eased to a 6-4 6-4 6-1 victory against French No. 17 Richard Gasquet. Seventh seed Tomas Berdych booked his place in the last eight with a four-set success against Spanish No. 10 Nicolas Almagro on Sunday, but the Czech was booed by the Hisense Arena crowd for refusing to shake his opponent\u2019s hand at the end of the match. It followed an incident in the fourth set where Berdych accused Almagro of purposefully aiming a volley at his face, with the ball striking him on the arm. \u201cWhoever has played the tennis knows that the court is pretty big, and you always have some space to put the ball in,\u201d said Berdych told reporters.  \u201cAnd not even if you stand each other like three or four meters close to the guy, just try to hit it straight to your face, you know.  I was just able and lucky to somehow fell down.  \u201cI already take it as a past, it\u2019s just one thing that what happened from the side of Nico \u2026 So I think if they want to look at it like that, then I think maybe we both did some mistake.\u201d Berdych\u2019s last-eight opponent will be 2009 champion Rafael Nadal, the second seed who beat fellow Spaniard Feliciano Lopez 6-4 6-4 6-2."

Wilson holed a 10-foot birdie putt at the 18th to complete a final-round 69 at La Quinta\u2019s PGA West and finish 24 under par for the tournament as darkness descended on the California course on Sunday. The Illinois native began Sunday by playing the final three holes of his third round, after gusts of up to 35 miles per hour had stopped play on Saturday.  But Wilson saw his three-shot lead wiped out as his compatriots Robert Garrigus, John Mallinger and Johnson Wagner all took advantage of low-scoring conditions on the Palmer Private Course \u2013 one of three used for the tournament. Garrigus (68) led the field until a bogey at the 17th saw him slip back and finish alongside last weekend\u2019s Sony Open winner Wagner (65) and Mallinger (66) on 22 under. \u201cRobert and I, going back and forth, we really enjoyed that,\u201d Wilson told the PGA Tour\u2019s official website after winning the pro-am event formerly known as the Bob Hope Classic.  \u201cIt just came down to 18, and I didn\u2019t want to give him a chance to make that putt to tie me. That\u2019s what we play for. You want somebody to win it, not necessarily to lose it.\u201d Wilson\u2019s first win since the Phoenix Open in February 2011 moved him up to second place in the early-season FedEx Cup standings behind Wagner. The 37-year-old also pocketed a winner\u2019s check for just over $1 million. \u201cWe really couldn\u2019t see much,\u201d Garrigus, who completed a third-round 61 earlier in the day, said of the dark and challenging conditions.  \u201cI could barely pick up the flag on 18.

Matt Kuchar, a member of the 2010 U.S. Ryder Cup team, carded a 65 after starting on the back nine to finish on 15 under in a four-way tie for 22nd place. World No. 11 Kuchar finished level with Josh Teater (69), Bob Estes (68) and Canada\u2019s Stephen Ames (70). Four-time major winner Phil Mickelson also started on the back nine and finished in a five-way tie for 49th on 10 under. "

        "content": "He steered Great Britain through the perils of World War II and is recognized as one of the most important statesmen of the 20th century.   But away from the world of politics, Winston Churchill was also an avid painter, drawn to scenes of stately homes in the UK, picturesque fields in France and vibrant Moroccan landscapes.   Though he always saw himself as an amateur, he was quick to spot talent in others.  Now, for the first time, paintings of Marrakech in Morocco by Churchill are being shown alongside those of Moroccan artist Hassan el Glaoui, who throughout his life credited Churchill with convincing his father \u2013 the Pasha of Marrakech \u2013 to let him pursue his dream of becoming a painter.  \u201cThe Pasha of Marrakesh was quite a fearful character and had great influence politically and great wealth, and the idea that his son was going to be a painter clearly wouldn\u2019t have come naturally to him,\u201d said Daniel Robbins, curator of the exhibition \u201cMeetings in Marrakech\u201d at Leighton House Museum in London.  In 1943, the Pasha showed the visiting Churchill some paintings by his son and asked for his opinion. Churchill approved and the young Hassan was subsequently allowed to train as a painter in Paris.   \u201cThere weren\u2019t many people that the Pasha would listen to but if Churchill said it was alright to be painter, he could accommodate that desire,\u201d said Robbins.  Hassan El Glaoui\u2019s career took off and he has since exhibited his work in Europe and the US, as well as in Morocco.  At a sale at Christie\u2019s auction house in Paris in 2007, a painting by El Glaoui sold for 42,000 Euros ($54,000).  Though El Glaoui was never able to meet and thank Churchill, the exhibition at Leighton House Museum \u2013 which was first proposed by the artist\u2019s daughter \u2013 is a belated meeting between the two painters. Churchill\u2019s granddaughter Celia Sandys, who helped organize the show, had been unaware of the role her father played in El Glaoui\u2019s artistic career, but said that she was \u201cenchanted to hear it.\u201d After all, Churchill had great affection for Morocco, she said, and his only painting during World War II was a view of Marrakech, which he painted following the Casablanca Conference in 1943.  After the conference, Churchill insisted that President Franklin D. Roosevelt make the trip to Marrakech to see the view from a tower on the edge of the city.  After Roosevelt left, Churchill painted the same scene and later presented it to him as a gift.   \u201cPainting was very important indeed [to Churchill], it was what you would nowadays call a stress-buster,\u201d said Sandys. \u201cIt was the thing he loved to do more than anything.\u201d  Paintings by Churchill now command high figures \u2013 a painting of his home, Chartwell, sold for \u00a31 million ($1.5 million) at an auction at Sotheby\u2019s auction house in London in 2007 \u2013 but when he first picked up a brush he was 40 years old and at a low point in his life.  It was in 1915, during World War I, according to Robbins, and Churchill had just resigned as First Lord of the Admiralty following the disastrous campaign in the Dardanelles.  \u201cSomeone suggested that he take up painting and he had a go with his children\u2019s watercolors,\u201d Robbins said.  \u201cThe he tried in oils and he just became hooked on painting and it became his principle form of relaxing,\u201d he continued.  Robbins admitted that it can be difficult to separate the paintings from the man who created them. But he said, \u201cIt\u2019s striking just from hanging the exhibition how well his paintings stand up.\u201d \u201c[The work] does deserve to be taken seriously and not solely because it\u2019s the product of this great statesman,\u201d he continued.

Balotelli appeared to catch the side of Parker\u2019s head with his boot after the pair had clashed in the second half at the Etihad Stadium. And to compound the misery for Spurs, Balotelli went on to score a last-minute penalty in the top-of-the-table clash, with his winner putting City eight points clear of third-placed Tottenham. Manchester clubs sink London rivals to move clear at summit An FA statement read: \u201cThe FA has today charged Manchester City forward Mario Balotelli with violent conduct following an incident in his side\u2019s home game against Tottenham Hotspur. \u201cBalotelli was involved in an incident with Tottenham\u2019s Scott Parker during Manchester City\u2019s 3-2 victory at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday 22 January 2012. Balotelli has until 6 p.m. on Wednesday 25 January 2012 to respond to the charge.\u201d The incident angered Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp, who told reporters: \u201cI don\u2019t like people kicking other people in the head on a football pitch. \u201cIt is not something I understand. Why should he go and back-heel someone in the head when he is on the floor?\u201d Should Balotelli be found guilty, he will be banned for four matches because he has been sent off once already this season. Balotelli would miss the Premier League trips to Everton and Aston Villa, plus the home encounter with Fulham  and the second leg of the League Cup semifinal against Liverpool. Controversy has dogged the Italian international since his move to Manchester in August 2010. He has already been sent off three times in a season-and-a-half at City and has been involved in a number of incidents both on and off the pitch that have publicly angered City manager Roberto Mancini. However, one piece of good news for Mancini on Monday came with the confirmation that the FA has decided not to hand defender Joleon Lescott a violent conduct charge, after the England international appeared to catch Tottenham\u2019s Younes Kaboul in the face with his forearm during the same match.

        "content": "The European Union is dialing up the pressure on Iran, saying Monday it will cut off oil imports and freeze assets in an effort to starve the country\u2019s nuclear program of funding. \u201cToday\u2019s action demonstrates the EU\u2019s growing concern about Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, and our determination to increase peaceful, legitimate pressure on Iran to return to negotiations,\u201d British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement from Brussels, Belgium. The sanctions freeze the assets of Iran\u2019s central bank in European Union nations and ban the importation of Iranian oil to those countries. The measures also block European Union countries from exporting petrochemical equipment and technology to Iran, or trading diamonds and precious metals with the Middle Eastern state. The sanctions are necessary because Iran continues to defy United Nations resolutions regarding its nuclear program, Hague said. \u201cIran has it in its power to end sanctions by changing course and addressing the concerns of the international community,\u201d he said. Saudi prince: Why Iran won\u2019t close Strait of Hormuz U.S. officials welcomed the sanctions, with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton saying in a joint statement Monday that the new measures will \u201csharpen the choice for Iran\u2019s leaders.\u201d But Iran\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Abbas Aragchi, said the measures will only harm the fragile economies of the European Union, according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. \u201cSanctions have proved ineffective in the past and will prove futile in the future, too,\u201d IRNA quoted Aragchi as saying. The U.S. government  took its own punitive action regarding Iran on Monday, with the Treasury Department targeting the nation\u2019s third-largest bank, the state-owned Bank Tejarat, for allegedly working with other Iranian banks and firms subject to sanctions tied to Iran\u2019s nuclear program.  Read a summary of sanctions against Iran This step means \u201call of Iran\u2019s largest state-owned banks have been sanctioned by the U.S. based on their involvement in Iran\u2019s illicit activities,\u201d according to a statement from the U.S. government department. David S. Cohen, the U.S. Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, called Bank Tejarat \u2013 which has nearly 2,000 branches in Iran, plus branches in France and Takijistan \u2013 \u201cone of Iran\u2019s few remaining access points to the international financial system. \u201cToday\u2019s sanction against Bank Tejarat will deepen Iran\u2019s financial isolation, make its access to hard currency even more tenuous, and further impair Iran\u2019s ability to finance its illicit nuclear program,\u201d said Cohen. The International Atomic Energy Agency said shortly after the fresh oil sanctions were announced that officials from the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency will visit Iran January 29 to 31 \u201cto resolve all outstanding substantive issues.\u201d How sanctions hit ordinary Iranians Inspectors are in and out of the country regularly, an agency spokeswoman said Monday, but a high-level visit of the kind taking place at the end of the month is more unusual. Top officials in Israel, which fears it would be a target of an Iranian nuclear weapon, welcomed the sanctions. \u201cThis is a step in the right direction. \u2026 Heavy and swift pressure on Iran is needed,\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, even as he warned that it is impossible to know what would come of the measures.  \u201cFor now, Iran continues to produce nuclear weapons without disturbance,\u201d he said. Defense Minister Ehud Barak called the EU move \u201chighly important,\u201d saying it set \u201ca new standard for the sanctions like never before.\u201d Iran exports 2.2. million barrels of oil a day, with about 18% bound for European markets, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The world consumes about 89 million barrels of oil per day. The European Union will allow contracts that are already in place to be fulfilled until July 1, it said.  Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi told CNN last week that his country could make up the difference if Iran was banned from exporting oil. Al-Naimi said the country has a spare capacity \u201cto respond to emergencies worldwide, to respond to our customer demand, and that is really the focus. Our focus is not on who drops out from production, but who wants more.\u201d Tehran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, the only outlet to and from the Persian Gulf, as it faces possible sanctions. The United States has made clear it will not let that happen. Iran: Stuck between U.S. and a hard place Seventeen million barrels of oil per day passed through the critical shipping lane in 2011, according to the Energy Information Administration. The Iranian government gets about half its revenue from oil exports, according to the agency. Analysts have said that while the new sanctions are the toughest ever imposed, they still contain many loopholes. Iran is expected to still be able to sell its oil to places like China, India or other Asian countries, but perhaps at a discount of 10% to 15%. About 35% of Iran\u2019s oil exports currently go to China and India. Western leaders have been walking a fine line with Iran, working to come up with a plan that squeezes the country\u2019s finances yet doesn\u2019t result in a loss of Iranian oil exports, which could send crude and gasoline prices skyrocketing. The United States and United Kingdom have already put new measures in place against Iran, and Washington has been pressing allies, including Japan and South Korea, to stop buying Iranian oil. U.S. carrier defies Hormuz threat On Friday, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton challenged Iran to respond to an offer she made in a letter last October. Ashton wrote that world powers are open to negotiations if Iran is serious about addressing its nuclear program without preconditions. Her office released the letter on Friday. Ashton\u2019s spokesperson pointedly noted, \u201cWe are waiting for the Iranian reaction.\u201d Ashton wrote that the West wants to \u201cengage in a confidence-building exercise\u201d that would lead to a \u201cconstructive dialogue\u201d and a \u201cstep by step approach\u201d in which Iran would assure the international community that its nuclear program is peaceful. Clinton told reporters in Washington that \u201cwe stand by that letter.\u201d  \u201cThey have to give up their nuclear weapons program \u2026 and they have to be willing to come to the table with a plan to do that,\u201d she said. Clinton made the comments Friday after a meeting at the State Department with German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle.  The German minister was blunt in his assessment of Iran\u2019s actions: \u201cTehran keeps violating its international obligations on the transparency of its nuclear program. We have no choice but to pass tough new sanctions that address the financial sources of the nuclear program.\u201d Iran says its nuclear program is not military, but the United States and many of its allies suspect Iran intends to produce a bomb. The International Atomic Energy Agency has expressed similar concerns. \u201cOne thing is clear,\u201d Westerwelle added. \u201cThe door for serious dialogue remains open, but the option of nuclear weapons in Iran is not acceptable to both of us.\u201d"

        "content": "Two more bodies have been recovered from the wreck of the cruise ship Costa Concordia, Italian officials announced Monday, bringing the number of confirmed victims of the accident to 15. The two women were found on Bridge 4, near the ship\u2019s Internet cafe, said Franco Gabrielli, the official in charge of the operation. About 17 people remain missing after the ship collided with rocks January 13 off the coast of Tuscany, according to a CNN count. Salvage workers are to begin pumping fuel out of the liner Monday, Gabrielli said. \u201cSalvage will start any minute,\u201d Adm. Ilarione Dell\u2019Anna said Monday afternoon. It will take 28 working days to remove all the fuel from the ship, the admiral said. The search for survivors and victims will continue alongside the salvage, said Gabrielli, the head of Italy\u2019s civil protection agency. The man in charge of the rescue operation said the divers faced a grim task. \u201cImagine that you left for holidays and that the power went off in your house. What would you find in your fridge? The divers are in there,\u201d Ennio Aquilino said. Two more bodies were found over the weekend \u2013 one woman on Saturday and one on Sunday, both wearing life jackets. Divers used explosives Monday morning to blow more holes in the side of the ship to allow easier access. The parties involved in the rescue told reporters and residents on the island Sunday that search and rescue efforts will continue \u2013 but that the environmental risk is also becoming urgent. Officials said they cannot predict how long it will take to clear the wreckage, since that depends on maritime conditions and technical difficulties, but all legal, environmental and human factors will be taken into account. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Italy to show it can do something right and do it well,\u201d said Gabrielli. Gabrielli warned that the task ahead was complicated and daunting, not least because it takes about 45 minutes to search each cabin, using special cameras and divers. The giant Costa Concordia had 1,500 cabins on board. A class-action lawsuit will be filed in Miami against Costa and its parent company, Carnival Corp., the Italian consumer group Codacons said on Saturday. The suit, in collaboration with two U.S. law firms, is \u201caimed specifically at getting compensation for all damages to the boat passengers,\u201d Codacons said in a statement. The class-action suit is open to passengers of any nationality, it said.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been contacted by hundreds of victims and the numbers are growing moment by moment,\u201d said Mitchell Proner, senior partner at Proner & Proner, one of two firms involved. He said crew members have also contacted the firm, \u201cand their stories that are coming in are horrific \u2013 from lifeboats that were stuck halfway, passengers debating whether to jump or not, this was not an orderly evacuation.\u201d The suit, he said, will request at least 125,000 euros (about $160,000) per passenger.  The suit has not yet been filed, said Marc Bern, senior partner at the other firm, Napoli Bern Ripka Shkolnik, but \u201cit will probably be in the billions of euros and dollars.\u201d \u201cThe sheer terror of being on a ship of that magnitude going down, you can imagine the psychological damage,\u201d Bern said. Gabrielli said no fuel oil had yet leaked from the ship \u2013 only kitchen and engine oil \u2013 and that he did not see an immediate risk of the 2,400 tons on board escaping. Booms have been put in place around the ship to stop the spread of oil and other pollutants such as detergents and sewage chemicals. With more than 4,000 people aboard, the ship was the size of a small town, Gabrielli said. Fuel will be replaced with water as it is removed from the ship\u2019s tanks, keeping the ship balanced, said Dell\u2019Anna, head of coastal authorities for the port city of Livorno.  Gabrielli said Costa Cruises, the company that owns the cruise ship, is cooperative and was proving responsible, despite past errors. Both Costa Cruises and authorities have criticized Capt. Francesco Schettino, who is under house arrest and faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship. Prosecutors said they planned to appeal the judge\u2019s decision to grant Schettino house arrest, arguing that Schettino should remain in jail because he is a flight risk and because of the gravity of his alleged crimes.  Alessandro Antichi, partner of Schettino defense attorney Bruno Leporatti, said the defense plans to file its appeal Wednesday on the judge\u2019s ruling. The defense maintains Schettino should not be in custody. An audio recording obtained by Italy\u2019s Repubblica newspaper and published Saturday shows that the captain, at least at the outset of the incident, assured authorities he would do the right thing. Prosecutors have accused the captain of piloting the ship too fast to allow him to react to dangers, causing the shipwreck, according to legal papers. There were roughly 4,200 people on the Costa Concordia when it ran aground \u2013 about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members. The vast majority fled the ship safely. "

The Portuguese striker fired home his 22nd and 23rd goals of the league season from 12 yards to help Real gets back to winning ways after their midweek defeat to Barca in the Spanish Cup. Real fell behind against Bilbao when Fernando Llorente volleyed home Javi Martinez\u2019s cross but Brazilian defender Marcelo equalized 12 minutes later. Llorente missed a great chance to restore his side\u2019s lead but he sliced wide with only Iker Casillas to beat. It would prove to be a costly error. Ronaldo scored his first penalty after Kaka had been pulled to the floor in the penalty area by Ander Iturraspe and got his second 20 minutes later after Mesut Ozil was fouled by Oscar De Marcos, who was shown a red card. Jose Callejon scored Real\u2019s fourth as he raced onto Gonzalo Higua\u00edn\u2019s pass and fired into the net. Earlier on Sunday, Lionel Messi\u2019s fifth hat-trick of the season sent Spanish and European champions Barcelona on their way to a 4-1 win at Malaga. The Argentina striker got his first just after the half hour, heading home Adriano\u2019s cross before an Alexis Sanchez tap in made it 2-0. Messi\u2019s next two goals were carbon copies as he burst through Malaga\u2019s defense before slotting home. Rondon grabbed a late consolation for Malaga.

        "content": "The French Senate voted late Monday to criminalize any public denial of what new legislation calls the Ottoman Empire\u2019s genocide of Armenians, triggering fresh condemnation from modern Turkey. Relations between France and Turkey have already deteriorated since the National Assembly \u2013 the lower house of the French parliament \u2013 voted to approve the bill in December. The Turkish government called Monday\u2019s vote \u201can example of irresponsibility\u201d and vowed to \u201cexpress our reaction against it in every platform.\u201d It is already illegal in France to deny the Holocaust of World War II, a crime punishable by a year in prison and a fine of 45,000 euros ($58,500). The same punishment would be used under the Armenian legislation.  Monday night\u2019s 127-86 vote sends the legislation to French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who has indicated he would sign it. Armenia\u2019s government hailed the vote, saying France \u201creaffirmed its pivotal role as a genuine defender of universal human values.\u201d But Turkey, one of France\u2019s NATO allies, called it \u201can entirely unfortunate step for French politics.\u201d \u201cPoliticization of the understanding of justice and history through other people\u2019s past and damaging freedom of expression in a tactless manner are first and foremost a loss for France,\u201d it in a statement on the vote. \u201cIt is obvious that the interpretation of historical events cannot be determined by the attitude of French politicians who see in themselves the right to judge other nations on the basis of one-sided views and declare a judgment on a serious allegation of crime such as genocide, thereby ignoring the principles of international law.\u201d The statement added, \u201cTurkey is determined to take every step required against this unjust action, which disregards basic human values and public conscience.\u201d The Turkish-Armenian controversy over the killings that took place last century has reverberated wherever diaspora communities representing both groups exist. Armenian groups and many scholars argue that Turks committed genocide starting in 1915, when more than a million ethnic Armenians were massacred in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire. Turkey officially denies that a genocide took place, saying hundreds of thousands of Armenian Christians and Turkish Muslims died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of World War I.  Before the vote, Sen. Herve Marseille, one of the bill\u2019s supporters, argued that since France already recognizes the Ottoman-era killings as genocide, the same standard that applies to Holocaust denial should apply to the Armenian case. \u201cWhen we contest the Jewish genocide, we can be punished,\u201d Marseille said. \u201cAnd up until now, when we contest the Armenian genocide, there is no punishment. So we can\u2019t have a legal punishment for one and not for the other. Everyone is equal in front of the law.\u201d But Sen. Jacques M\u00e9zard, who opposed the legislation, said freedom of expression was at stake. \u201cIt calls into question historical and scientific research. Tomorrow will there be a question of a Vend\u00e9e genocide?\u201d he asked, referring to a revolt against the French revolutionary government in 1793. \u201cWill we put the Spanish and the United States in the stocks for the massacre of Native Americans? We must reject this text and consign it to history books.\u201d After December\u2019s vote in the National Assembly, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused France of committing its own \u201cgenocide\u201d during its war against Algerian independence in the 1950s and 1960s. Erdogan announced that Turkey was reviewing its ties with France. Ankara recalled its ambassador to Paris for consultations, canceled bilateral visits and wouldn\u2019t cooperate with France in joint projects within the European Union.  The French Foreign Ministry shot back at Erdogan\u2019s comments, saying France \u201cassumes with clarity and transparency its duty to remember the tragedies that have marked its history.\u201d And Sarkozy has said that his country doesn\u2019t need an OK from another nation to develop its policies. In addition to being NATO allies, Turkey and France have trade ties valued at $13.5 billion, according to Turkish statistics. The genocide debate is also a source of tension between Turkey and the United States, another NATO ally. The White House, for example, annually beats back efforts in Congress to pass a resolution that would formally recognize the 1915 massacre of Armenians as genocide."

        "content": "Turkey\u2019s fraught relationship with France is set to erode further after the French Senate passed controversial legislation criminalizing any public denial of what the bill calls the Armenian genocide in Ottoman Turkey in 1915 \u2013 a description Turkey has rejected. Under the legislation, anyone denying the deaths were genocide could face a jail term and a fine of \u20ac45,000 ($58,000). The lower house of French parliament passed the so-called Armenian genocide bill last December, prompting Turkey to recall its ambassador from Paris and to cancel certain bilateral visits between the countries. The French Senate then voted late Monday to approve the bill. What do Armenians say allegedly happened in 1915?  Armenian groups and many scholars argue that starting in 1915, Turks committed genocide, when more than a million ethnic Armenians were massacred in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire. The Turkish-Armenian controversy over the killings that took place last century has reverberated wherever diaspora communities representing both groups exist. What does Turkey say happened in 1915? Modern-day Turkey, which emerged after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, has always denied a genocide took place in 1915. It argues instead that hundreds of thousands of Armenian Christians and Muslim Turks died from intercommunal violence, disease and general chaos \u2013 not from a specific plan to eliminate Armenians \u2013 around the bloody battlefields of World War I. \u201cIt has always been a sensitive issue,\u201d said Dr. Katerina Dalacoura, a lecturer in International Relations at the London School of Economics. \u201cTurkey has always refused to accept that it was a planned event. They argue that genocide only applies if it was a plan to exterminate people.\u201d Why is France doing this now? France formally recognized the killings as genocide in 2001.  As there is no new information or new recognition about what the facts are about events of 1915, some experts believe French President Nicolas Sarkozy may be using the genocide bill for political gain ahead of the country\u2019s presidential election in April.  \u201cIt\u2019s clear that President Sarkozy has put this on the table for electoral reasons - there is an Armenian community in France which will of course be voting,\u201d Christian Malard, Senior Foreign Analyst at France 3 TV, told CNN on Monday. The bill has been applauded by Armenians, roughly 500,000 of whom live in France. The bill\u2019s author, Valeri Bouyer from Sarkozy\u2019s ruling party, has denied any political motivation. As for Sarkozy, he has said his country doesn\u2019t need an OK from another nation to develop its policies. In a letter to the Turkish government, he said the law is not aimed at any country, but only at addressing past suffering. What is the public opinion in Turkey regarding the Armenian massacre?  Using the word genocide when talking about Armenia may not be as taboo as it once was, but Turks still chafe at the idea of other countries writing their history, says Fadi Hakura, Turkey Analyst at Chatham House, a London-based think tank. \u201cThings have been progressing, but the population does not like foreign powers defining their history,\u201d he said. \u201cIt generates a lot of misgivings.\u201d How would passage of the genocide bill affect Turkey-France relations? Ties between the two countries could now unravel further. Turkey already recalled its ambassador from Paris and cancelled some bilateral visits between the two countries after the French lower house passed the bill in December, and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned \u201cthis is only the first phase.\u201d Erdogan has also accused France of committing its own genocide during the war in Algeria in the 1950s and 1960s. \u201cIn Algeria, an estimated 15 percent of the population had been subjected to the massacre of French from 1945 on. This is genocide,\u201d Erdogan said at a conference in Istanbul last year. \u201cAlgerians were burnt en masse in ovens. They were martyred mercilessly. If French President Mr. (Nicolas) Sarkozy does not know about this genocide, he should ask his father Paul Sarkozy. His father Paul Sarkozy served as a soldier in the French legion in Algeria in 1940s.\u201d Once under French colonial rule, guerrillas in the North African nation fought a bloody war against the French presence there from 1954 to 1962. The French Foreign Ministry shot back at Erdogan\u2019s comments, saying \u201cwe deplore excessive use of formulas and personal attacks that do not meet up to the standards of our mutual interest and of our relations. France recalls that it assumes with clarity and transparency its duty to remember the tragedies that have marked its history.\u201d Erdogan has said that passage of the bill would result in Turkey initiating additional measures against France.  \u201cThis will create a lot of noise and difficulty in Turkey\u2019s overall relationships with France and other EU states that will complicate\u201d Turkey\u2019s efforts to gain accession to the European Union, said Ross Wilson, a former U.S. ambassador to Turkey. Turkey and France are NATO allies, and, according to official Turkish statistics, the volume of trade between Turkey and France from January to the end of October this year was more than $13.5 billion. Do any countries recognize the killing of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey in 1915 as genocide?  Twenty countries do, including Germany, Sweden and Canada, according to Hakura.  The genocide debate is an annual source of tension between Turkey and the United States, also two NATO allies. The White House, for example, annually beats back efforts in Congress to pass a resolution which would formally recognize the 1915 massacre of Armenians as genocide."

City\u2019s main title rivals, Manchester United, also negotiated a difficult test at Arsenal by winning 2-1 to remain on the coat tails of their big-spending neighbors. Victories for both Manchester clubs saw them pull clear from third-placed Tottenham \u2013 City are now eight points ahead of them, and United five \u2013 with the race for the championship now seeming like a two-horse race. Italy striker Balotelli was involved in another contentious incident in the match as he appeared to aim a stamp at Scott Parker\u2019s head, a flashpoint that angered Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp. \u201cWhat reason did he have to kick Scott in the head with his studs while he is lying on the floor? It\u2019s not a nice thing to do and it has no place in football,\u201d Redknapp told a press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s done that is it? I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t  be the last. I\u2019m the last person to talk about getting people sent off, but it\u2019s  blatantly obvious if you see that, he reacts like that at times to challenges.\u201d Prior to Balotelli\u2019s late spot kick the game burst to life in nine second half minutes. First, Samir Nasri\u2019s emphatic finish from Silva\u2019s pass on 56 minutes gave City the lead before Joleon Lescott bundled a corner into the net three minutes later. But City let the visitors back into the game within a minute as centre back Stefan Savic failed to deal with a long ball and Jermain Defoe took the ball round City goalkeeper Joe Hart to finish into an empty net. And five minutes later, Tottenham were level as Gareth Bale struck a superb equalizer from the edge of the penalty area after Aaron Lennon\u2019s pass. Defoe had a chance to win the game for Tottenham in injury time but though he stretched to connect with Bale\u2019s cross he could only poke the ball wide of the target from four yards out. And Tottenham were made to pay for that miss as Ledley King brought down Balotelli in the final minute of added on time and the Italian made no mistake from 12 yards. Manchester United took the lead at Arsenal\u2019s Emirates Stadium in north London when Antonio Valencia headed home Ryan Giggs\u2019 cross on the stroke of half time. Arsenal\u2019s Dutch captain Robin van Persie, who had already squandered a great chance to bring his side level, found the net on 71 minutes with an angled drive from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s pass. Teenage winger Oxlade-Chamberlain was substituted straight after the equalizer, drawing boos from the home support. And his replacement, Russian Andrei Arshavin, failed to close down Valencia as he got into the area late in the game to tee up England striker Danny Welbeck for the winner."

I think he\u2019s coming back awfully strong again,\u201d Federer said ahead of his 1000th Tour match. \u201cI was sad to see that he was out for so long after his amazing year in  2009 and I thought he had a chance in 2010 to sort of make a run for world  number one.\u201d Del Potro looked in imperious form as he dismantled the unseeded Kohlschreiber. \u201cRoger is the best tennis player of the history, and of course he\u2019s the favorite,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember three years ago I played in the quarters against him and I only  won three games. So if this time is something different and I win more games it  is going to be OK for me.\u201d Nadal enjoyed his 11th win against Lopez in 13 meetings and said he feels in better condition than the last two Australian Open tournaments, where injuries hampered his progress. \u201cI\u2019ve started the tournament playing really well this time. I felt I\u2019ve played well from the first match and today I played another complete match,\u201d  Nadal said. \u201cNow I\u2019m in the quarter-finals. I am doing the right things. I am in the right place, right moment.\u201d There was controversy in Berdych\u2019s win as the Czech refused to shake hands with Almagro at the end of the game after claiming his opponent had deliberately hit the ball at him. Berdych was booed off by the Melbourne crowd after he had to rely on three tiebreak wins to progress into the quarters. He claimed Alamgro targeted him as they rallied at the net. \u201cProbably whoever has played tennis knows that the court is pretty big, and you always have some space to put the ball in,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cHe should play the ball differently. That\u2019s it. \u201cI think maybe we both did some mistakes. So it\u2019s even, and that\u2019s it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any problems at all,\u201d Monday\u2019s action sees number one seed Novak Djokovic take on home favorite Lleyton Hewitt while British fourth seed Andy Murray takes on unseeded Mikhail Kukushkin from Kazakhstan. The other last 16 ties see Spaniard David Ferrer, seeded five, take on 17th seed Richard Gasquet, from France and sixth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga play Japanese 24th seed Kei Nishikori."

Grace, a native South African himself, secured his second successive title on home soil after emerging triumphant on the first extra hole after a three-way tie for first. The 23-year-old only came through the European Tour Qualifying School a month ago and became the first player since Fred Couples in 1995 to follow his maiden Tour win - at the Johannesburg Open last week \u2013 with another. After finishing on 12-under-par Grace held his nerve in the play-off to edge out Els and Goosen, who have five major championships between them. \u201cI\u2019m really ecstatic,\u201d Grace told the Tour\u2019s official website. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true to win such a big event \u2013 pretty much the best tournament I\u2019ve played in so far.\u201d Grace recovered after dropping three shots in the opening four holes and was five-under for the rest of his round.  He had a chance to seal the title on the 18th but missed a short birdie putt. Els recorded a round of 67 that included an eagle on the 13th while Goosen birdied three of the final four holes to shoot 70 and force his way into the playoff. \u201cA couple more putts here and there and that could have been something special,\u201d Els said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very encouraging week, all four rounds under par, and I\u2019m working on some good stuff.\u201d Belgian Nicolas Colsaerts was tied for the lead going down the last but he made a bogey to drop into fourth place while Masters champion Charl Schwartzel, from South Africa, finished fifth on 10-under. Europe\u2019s 2012 Ryder Cup captain Jose Maria Olazabal \u2013 who came into the tournament as the lowest ranked player at 596th \u2013 finished sixth on eight-under."

The fourth-round match was played as temperatures hit above 32 degrees Celsius (90 degrees Fahrenheit). Makarova\u2019s two previous grand slam appearances \u2013 at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open last year \u2013 ended with losses in the first round as she faded from a career-high 29th in the rankings \u2013 a position she reached with last-16 appearances in Melbourne and at the French Open. \u201cI\u2019m surprised because she\u2019s a great player and it\u2019s really tough to play against her,\u201d said the 23-year-old Makarova, who will next play her fourth-seeded compatriot Maria Sharapova. Nishikori makes history for Japan \u201cBut, I don\u2019t know, I was just feeling so good and so focused.  So I played my game, and that\u2019s it.  I won against Serena. That\u2019s amazing.\u201d Former world No. 1 Williams, seeded 12th, refused to blame the ankle injury she suffered in a warm-up tournament in Brisbane. \u201cI feel like I didn\u2019t play well today.  I don\u2019t feel like I can\u2019t get better. I feel like if I was in a situation where, \u2018Wow, she played so great, and I played amazing, and I served 80%, and I hit no double-faults, I didn\u2019t hit 37 unforced errors,\u2019 that would be a totally different situation,\u201d the 30-year-old said.   \u201cI didn\u2019t play well.

It was their first meeting since last year\u2019s Wimbledon semifinals, when Sharapova also won before losing in the final. Earlier Monday, Wimbledon champion and world No. 2  Petra Kvitova reached the quarterfinals after beating Serbian 21st seed and former No. 1 Ana Ivanovic 6-2 7-6 (7-2). The Czech will next face Italy\u2019s Sara Errani, who beat China\u2019s Zheng Jie 6-2 6-1. On Sunday, defending champion and 11th seed Kim Clijsters saved four match points as she overcame the opponent she beat in last year\u2019s Australian Open final, Li Na, 4-6 7-6 6-4. The former world No.1 was in trouble early on as she turned her ankle in the opening set and needed medical treatment before battling back to book a quarterfinal clash with top-ranked Caroline Wozniacki. Fifth seed Li took full advantage of Clijsters\u2019 discomfort by taking the first set, but the Belgian showed typical resilience when she leveled the match after a dramatic tie break, during which she faced match point four times. The setback clearly stunned Li, who quickly found herself 5-2 down in the deciding set before staging a late rally. But the momentum was with the Belgian, as she closed out the match. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I won,\u201d Clijsters told the Australian Open\u2019s official website. \u201cI knew before the match that it was going to be a tough match but I didn\u2019t expect this obviously! \u201cI don\u2019t want to quit my last time at the Australian Open. It [retiring] definitely crossed my mind at some point. But at one point you think, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m just gonna go for it.\u2019  Once I made that decision, I didn\u2019t think.\u201d Wozniacki, from Denmark, beat Serbian 13th seed Jelena Jankovic 6-0 7-5 as she continues her quest to secure the first grand slam victory of her career. After wrapping up the opening set in just over half an hour, Wozniacki dropped her serve twice in the second as Jankovic found her feet, but she held her nerve to serve out the match. \u201cI\u2019m just happy to be here as the winner of the match,\u201d Wozniacki said. \u201cI felt like I played some really good tennis out there today. \u201cShe started to play really well as well. She had nothing to lose so she had to go for it. I knew she was a fighter and it wasn\u2019t going to be easy. \u201c Elsewhere Sunday, world No. 3 Victoria Azarenka of Belarus cruised past Czech Iveta Benesova 6-2 6-2 to reach the last eight.

        "content": "Two pro-euro candidates appeared headed for a February runoff in Finland\u2019s presidential race after a first round of voting Sunday, according to complete results. With all boxes reporting, conservative former Finance Minister Sauli Niinisto had a solid lead with just under 37% percent of the vote. Meanwhile, pro-European Green League candidate Pekka Haavisto passed euro-skeptic Paavo Vayrynen to claim the No. 2 spot, with 18.8% over Vayrynen\u2019s 17.5%. Vayrynen had been running second in earlier returns.  Niinisto and Haavisto \u2013 Finland\u2019s first openly gay presidential candidate, according to Finnish media \u2013 are vying to succeed Tarja Halonen, Finland\u2019s first female president. Halonen has has reached her two-term limit after beating back a challenge from Niinisto, of the conservative National Coalition Party, in 2006.  A runoff between the top two finishers is slated for February 5. Turnout was estimated at nearly 73% of Finland\u2019s 4.4 million eligible voters. The eventual winner will break a 30-year lock on the presidency by Halonen\u2019s Social Democrats.  Finland is one of the states that joined the euro from the beginning, when Niinisto was finance minister. He insists Finland should stay in the eurozone, despite the debt crisis that has taken some of the shine off the common currency.  His NCP won the top share of votes in last  April\u2019s parliamentary election, and already leads a broad coalition government that includes the Social Democrats.  Finland is one of the few remaining AAA-rated countries in the eurozone. But 2012 is only expected to deliver a growth of 0.4%, with the possibility of a new recession, its finance ministry reports.  It has had to take part in the bailouts of other euro states who faced deep financial problems, such as Greece and Ireland. Many Finns now see Niinisto \u2013 who also served as deputy chairman of the European Investment Bank \u2013 as someone who can stand up for Finland\u2019s interests in the single currency. Haavisto, meanwhile, has served as Finland\u2019s environment and development minister and has international experience working for the European Union and the United Nations in Sudan and the Middle East. Vayrynen and his Center Party have argued that Finland should leave the euro, and he insisted before Sunday\u2019s vote that polls showing him running third were wrong. His third-place showing Sunday followed a strong finish in April by the euro-skeptic True Finns Party, which won 39 seats in parliament to become the third-largest party.  The True Finns demanded that Finland stop supporting the eurozone bailouts, but its presidential candidate, Timo Soini, was running fourth in Sunday\u2019s balloting. He told Finnish public broadcaster YLE that his weak support was an indication that his party wants him to remain as party leader, rather than president. Finland\u2019s president is in charge of the country\u2019s foreign policy, together with the government, and serves as commander-in-chief of its defense forces. But recent changes have seen more power being given to the government and parliament, and former President Mauno Koivisto told YLE that there was a risk of an \u201cimbalance\u201d between the direct public election of the president and the office\u2019s diminishing power."

        "content": "Italian search-and-rescue teams have found another body aboard the partly sunken cruise ship Costa Concordia, civil protection office spokeswoman Francesca Maffini said Sunday.  The woman is the 13th confirmed victim of the wreck on January 13.  Divers are working to recover the body, which was found underwater on bridge number 7, Maffini said. The victim was wearing a life jacket, she said. The discovery leaves about 19 people still missing since the ship hit rocks in the shallow waters off the coast of Tuscany, according to CNN count.  A 12th body was found within the ship Saturday afternoon, according to Italian authorities. The body of a woman wearing a life jacket was discovered in an area of the ship that was under water, Maffini said. A committee comprising the parties involved in the rescue told a briefing for reporters and residents on the island that search and rescue efforts will continue \u2013 but that the environmental risk is also becoming urgent. Officials said they cannot predict how long it will take to clear the wreckage, since that depends on maritime conditions and technical difficulties, but all legal, environmental and human factors will be taken into account. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Italy to show it can do something right and do it well,\u201d said Franco Gabrielli. Gabrielli, who leads Italy\u2019s civil protection agency, warned that the task ahead was complicated and daunting, not least because it takes about 45 minutes to search each cabin, using special cameras and divers. The giant Costa Concordia had 1,500 cabins on board. Gabrielli said no fuel oil had yet leaked from the ship \u2013 only kitchen and engine oil \u2013 and that he did not see an immediate risk of the 2,400 tons on board escaping. A plan to remove the fuel oil has been approved, he said, and will begin once experts give the go-ahead. Booms have been put in place around the ship to stop the spread of oil and other pollutants such as detergents and  sewage chemicals. With 4,000 people aboard, the ship was the size of a small town, Gabrielli said. Fuel will be replaced with water as it is removed from the ship\u2019s tanks to keep the ship balanced, said Adm. Ilarione Dell\u2019Anna, head of coastal authorities for the port city of Livorno.  Gabrielli said Costa Cruises, the company that owns the cruise ship is cooperative and was proving responsible, despite past errors. Both Costa Cruises and authorities have criticized Capt. Francesco Schettino, who is under house arrest and faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship. An audio recording obtained by Italy\u2019s Repubblica newspaper and published Saturday shows that the captain, at least at the outset of the incident, assured authorities he would do the right thing.  According to the recording, an Italian Coast Guard official asks Schettino how many people needed to be evacuated to the top of the ship to be rescued on life boats.  \u201cAbout two of three hundred people still,\u201d the captain says.  The Coast Guard asks \u2013 will everyone evacuate, or will someone stay behind? \u201cI will stay here,\u201d Schettino answers, saying that he believed that the boat was done leaning over.  Other audio recordings previously released, however, indicate that Schettino did not stay on board, but left the ship, to the anger of authorities.  The office of prosecutor Francesco Verusio said it would lodge an appeal against the investigating judge\u2019s decision to grant the captain house arrest. Verusio has said he that the captain should be in jail given the flight risk, and the gravity of his crimes. Schettino\u2019s lawyer, Bruno Leporatti, spoke to Italian news channel Sky Tg24 on Friday, urging people to reserve judgment on the captain until they have all the facts. Schettino\u2019s leadership has been repeatedly questioned. Earlier this week, a cook from the ship told a Filipino television station that the captain ordered dinner for himself and a woman at about 10:30 p.m. \u2013 less than an hour after the collision. However, a Moldovan woman, Domnica Cemortan, 25, who also works for the cruise line but said she was on the Concordia as a passenger, defended the captain in a TV interview. \u201cI\u2019ve heard in Russian media that the captain left the ship first, or among the first. But this is not true,\u201d she said. Prosecutors have accused the captain of piloting the ship too fast to allow him to react to dangers, causing the shipwreck, according to legal papers. There were roughly 4,200 people on the Costa Concordia when it ran aground \u2013 about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members. The vast majority fled the ship safely. "

The co-hosts (with neighboring Gabon) had the ball in the back of the Libyan net in the first half, but Ivan Bolado\u2019s 16th minute effort was adjudged offside by the referee.  Libya had chances to equalize, perhaps the best falling to Jamal Mohamed whose shot was parried away by Danilo. Aboud produced a fine save from a Lawrence Doe free kick midway through the second half before Balboa scored late on to grab all three points. The win also earned the team a $1 million bonus, which was promised by the son of long-standing president Teodoro Obiang Nguema shortly before the tournament got underway.  Defeat for Libya capped a miserable opening day after a Moammar Gadhafi-era green flag appeared on the tournament\u2019s official website.

Fernando Torres endured another fruitless afternoon in Chelsea colors notching up his 17th game in a row without a goal as the champions of two seasons ago played out a 0-0 draw at Carrow Road.  The result leaves Chelsea in fourth place with 41 points with the teams all around them playing on Sunday.  Third-placed Tottenham Hotspur play league leaders Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium, while second-place Manchester United travel to the Emirates to take on Arsenal who are fifth.  Liverpool scored their first goal of the Premier League in 2012 but it didn\u2019t stop them going down to a 3-1 defeat at Bolton Wanderers.  A goal from Mark Davies gave Bolton the lead in the fourth minute with Nigel Reo-Coker doubling the lead after 30 minutes.  Craig Bellamy pulled one back for the Reds seven minutes later but when Gretar Rafn Steinsson drilled a low shot past Pepe Reina five minutes into the second half, Liverpool couldn\u2019t muster a response.  The win moves Bolton out of the bottom three to 17th. Liverpool remain stuck on 35 points in seventh.      At the other end of the table Queens Park Rangers beat bottom side Wigan 3-1 thanks to goals from Heidar Helguson, Akos Buzsaky and Tommy Smith.  The win \u2013 Mark Hughes\u2019 first since he took over from Neil Warnock \u2013 lifts QPR to 16th in the table with 20 points.  Relegation-threatened Blackburn Rovers earned a point at Goodison Park against Everton. Tim Cahill\u2019s first goal in over a year gave the home side the lead in 24th minute but Scottish striker David Goodwillie hit back in the 72nd minute to level the scores.  Blackburn are 18th with 18 points while Everton are 14th with 26 points.  West Bromwich Albion also earned some valuable away points defeating Stoke City 2-1 at the Britannia Stadium.  An injury-time free-kick from Scottish midfielder Graham Dorrans sealed the points after a header from Stoke substitute Cameron Jerome in the 86th minute canceled out James Morrison\u2019s 35th minute goal. The win leaves Roy Hodgson\u2019s side 15th with 25 points. Stoke remain in eighth with 30 points. Fulham also eased relegation worries with a thumping 5-2 win over Newcastle United at Craven Cottage.

Two goals in either half \u2013 from Stephane Sessegnon and Craig Gardner \u2013 lift Sunderland to 10th with 27 points, one point above Swansea who are 13th.

Two early goals from the 35-year-old striker saw him reach a total of 211 goals for Roma, which means he has scored more goals for one club than any other player in Serie A history.  His tally sees him surpass the previous record of 210 set by the prolific Swedish striker Gunnar Nordahl who played for AC Milan in the 1950s.  \u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019ve always wanted, to wear this shirt and beat one record after another,\u201d said Totti, AFP reported. \u201cI\u2019ve overtaken Nordahl and I\u2019m proud of that.

Totti\u2019s early brace and a goal from Fabio Borini put Roma 3-0 up with only eight minutes played.   Juan and Miralem Pjanic added further goals in the second half after CM Eder had pulled a goal back for Cesena on the hour mark.  The win lifts Roma to sixth \u2013 although Napoli will overtake them again if they win at Siena on Sunday \u2013 and boosts their chances of qualifying for European football next season.  Cesena, however, remain mired in trouble hovering just above the foot of the table in 18th place with 15 points.  Juventus\u2019 2-0 win over Atalanta sees them maintain their advantage at the top of Serie A over their nearest rivals AC Milan (who play Novara on Sunday) and Udinese (who host Catania).

Meanwhile in La Liga, Espanyol moved up to fifth place with a 3-0 win over struggling Granada on Saturday.  Jose Baena headed home their first goal from a set piece in the 26th minute before Joan Verdu doubled the lead from the penalty spot moments before halftime.  The home side didn\u2019t kill off a spirited Granada until ten minutes from time when Portuguese substitute Rui Fonte scored from close range to seal the three points.  Getafe enjoyed a 2-1 away to Racing Santander with goals from Jaime Gavilan (26th minute) and Nicolas Miku (83rd minute) after Christian Stuani had given the home side the lead in the 14th minute. Atletico Madrid\u2019s long wait for an away win in the league is over after an emphatic 4-0 win at Real Sociedad.  Radamel Falcao scored a hat-trick with Adrian netting Atletico\u2019s other goal.     The Seville derby between Real Betis and Sevilla ended with honors even.  A superb free kick from Benat gave the home side the lead in 26th minute, but Alvaro Negredo leveled the scores before half-time with a header.   Sevilla had to play the final quarter of the match with 10-men after defender Federico Fazio was sent off, but clung on for the draw.   In Sunday\u2019s fixtures, Barcelona travel to Malaga while Real Madrid host Athletic Bilbao.  Third-place Valencia are away to Osasuna.

        "content": "Divers continued their search for survivors from the Italian cruise ship Saturday, as concerns grow over the potential environmental threat posed by the wreck.  A 12th body was found within the ship Saturday afternoon, Italian authorities confirmed, with at least 20 people still missing since the Costa Concordia ran aground off the island of Giglio last week. The body of a woman wearing a life jacket was discovered in an area of the ship that was under water, said Francesca Maffini, spokeswoman for Franco Gabrielli, the individual in charge of operations at the site. A committee made up of all the parties involved in the rescue operation told a briefing for reporters and villagers on the island that search and rescue efforts will continue \u2013 but that the environmental risk is also becoming urgent. Officials said they cannot predict how long it will take to clear the wreckage, since that depends on maritime conditions and technical difficulties, but that all legal, environmental and human factors will be taken into account. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Italy to show it can do something right and do it well,\u201d Gabrielli said. Gabrielli, who leads Italy\u2019s civil protection agency, warned that the task ahead was complicated and daunting, not least because it takes about 45 minutes to search each cabin, using special cameras and divers. The giant Costa Concordia had 1,500 cabins on board. Gabrielli said no fuel oil had yet leaked from the ship \u2013 only kitchen and engine oil \u2013 and that he did not see an immediate risk of the 2,400 tons on board escaping. A plan to remove the fuel oil has now been approved, he said, and will begin once experts give the go-ahead. Booms have been put in place around the ship to try to stop the spread not just of oil but of many other pollutants, from detergents to sewage chemicals. With 4,000 people aboard, the ship was the size of a small town, Gabrielli said. Adm. Ilarione Dell\u2019Anna, head of coastal authorities for the port city of Livorno, said fuel will be replaced with water as it is removed from the ship\u2019s tanks, to keep the ship balanced. Gabrielli said Costa Cruises, the company that owns the cruise ship, was being very cooperative and was proving responsible, despite past errors. Both Costa Cruises and authorities have criticized Capt. Francesco Schettino, who is under house arrest and faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship. An audio recording obtained by Italy\u2019s Repubblica newspaper and published Saturday shows that the captain, at least at the outset of the incident, assured authorities he would do the right thing.  According to the recording, an Italian Coast Guard official asks Schettino how many people still needed to be evacuated to the top of the ship to be rescued on life boats.  \u201cAbout two of three hundred people still,\u201d the captain says.  The Coast Guard asks \u2013 will everyone evacuate, or will someone stay behind? \u201cI will stay here,\u201d Schettino answers, saying that he believed that the boat was done leaning over.  Other audio recordings previously released, however, indicate that Schettino did not stay on board, but left the ship, to the chagrin of authorities.  The office of prosecutor Francesco Verusio said it would lodge an appeal Saturday at a court in Florence against the investigating judge\u2019s decision to grant the captain house arrest. Verusio has said he that the captain should be in jail given the flight risk, and the gravity of his crimes. Schettino\u2019s lawyer, Bruno Leporatti, spoke to Italian news channel Sky Tg24 on Friday, urging people to reserve judgment on the captain until they have all the facts. Schettino\u2019s leadership has been repeatedly questioned. Earlier this week, a cook from the ship told a Filipino television station that the captain ordered dinner for himself and a woman at about 10:30 p.m. \u2013 less than an hour after the collision. However, a Moldovan woman, Domnica Cemortan, 25, who also works for the cruise line but said she was on the Concordia as a passenger, defended the captain in a TV interview. \u201cI\u2019ve heard in Russian media that the captain left the ship first, or among the first. But this is not true,\u201d she said. The cruise ship ran aground off the Tuscan coast on January 13, and it appears increasingly unlikely that any survivors will be found. Eight of the dead have so far been named \u2013 four French passengers, a Spanish passenger, an Italian, along with a Hungarian crew member and a Peruvian crew member. Prosecutors have accused the captain of piloting the ship too fast to allow him to react to dangers, causing the shipwreck, according to legal papers. Judge Valeria Montesarchio\u2019s initial ruling found Schettino changed the ship\u2019s course, steering too close to shore and causing the ship to hit a rock. Earlier this week, Costa Cruises chairman Pier Luigi Foschi placed the blame for the wreck squarely on the captain, saying it was his choice to deviate from frequently traveled routes.  There were roughly 4,200 people on the Costa Concordia when it ran aground \u2013 about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members. The vast majority fled the ship safely. "

The 22-year-old seized on a mistake by Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer to curl the ball home, his 11th goal in 16 Bundesliga games. Herrmann opened his account near halftime after receiving a fine through pass from ex-Germany striker Mike Hanke. Bayern were clearly missing the suspended Franck Ribery and the home side went further ahead with 20 minutes left as the excellent Reus played in Herrmann for his neatly-taken second. Bastian Schweinsteiger, returning for Bayern after breaking his collarbone in November, scored a late consolation for the well-beaten leaders.

        "content": "A suspected member of an Irish Republican Army splinter group was found guilty Friday of murdering two soldiers outside a British army base in Northern Ireland almost three years ago. Brian Shivers, 46, was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of the murders as well as six counts of attempted murder and one count of possession of firearms and ammunition with intent to endanger life. However, co-defendant Colin Duffy was acquitted of the same charges. Two English soldiers, Patrick Azimkar, 21, and Mark Quinsey, 23, were killed outside Massereene Barracks in March 2009. The off-duty and unarmed servicemen were ambushed with gunfire as they collected a pizza delivery at the front gate of the base, hours before they were due to leave for a tour of Afghanistan. They were the first members of the British security forces to be killed in Northern Ireland since the signing of the Good Friday peace agreement in 1998. Other soldiers and the pizza delivery men were injured. The Real IRA claimed responsibility for the attack. Shivers and Duffy both denied any involvement in the ambush during the non-jury trial at Antrim Crown Court. Shivers\u2019 lawyer described him as an \u201cunlikely terrorist.\u201d The court heard he had cystic fibrosis and had been told by a doctor he only had a few years to live. However, evidence showed that Shivers\u2019 DNA was found on matches discovered in the getaway car, which the attackers unsuccessfully tried to destroy. In his verdict Friday, Justice Anthony Hart said: \u201cI am satisfied that the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that Shivers set fire to the Cavalier at Ranaghan Road, and I therefore find him guilty on each count on the indictment.\u201d The Cavalier was the getaway car. Earlier on Friday, 44-year-old Duffy was cleared of all charges. Hart said that while Duffy\u2019s DNA was found on a latex glove and a seatbelt buckle in the getaway car, that did not prove he was involved in the two murders and attempted murders. The judge added: \u201cI consider that there is insufficient evidence to satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt - whatever Mr. Duffy may have done when he wore the latex glove or touched the seatbelt buckle, that he was preparing the car in some way for this murderous attack. And I therefore find him not guilty.\u201d Duffy had been charged with terrorist offenses in the past, but was never convicted. He refused to answer questions from reporters Friday as he walked free from court to a waiting car. Pro-British protestors shouted angrily at him as he was driven away. Police and relatives of the murdered soldiers then held a joint news conference, and the families said they were disappointed by the acquittal and knew others were involved in the ambush. \u201cA huge group of guilty people have yet to be brought to justice,\u201d said Jaime Quinsey, a sister of Mark Quinsey. Patrick Azimkar\u2019s mother, Geraldine Ferguson, appealed for anyone with information to contact police. Chief Superintendent Peter Farrar said officers were determined to find anyone involved in the murders."

Formula One has been a regular visitor to the principality since 1929, but rallying has returned this week after a three-year hiatus for the opening round of the 2012 world championship, with the sport\u2019s undisputed king Sebastien Loeb seeking an unprecedented ninth crown. So how important is Monte Carlo to rally and motorsport?  \u201cIt is very difficult to drive a train with no locomotive,\u201d Ruchdi Hajjar, director of the Automobile Club de Monaco  told CNN. Hajjar said Monte Carlo\u2019s absence from the World Rally Championship was down to a disagreement with the sport\u2019s governing body over regulations which were introduced for the 2009 season.  \u201cDue to the alternation of regulations, the Monte Carlo Rally had to leave the WRC in 2008. We were requested by the FIA to come back in 2012 which we did after obtaining some guarantees of changes in the regulations that we hardly believe in.\u201d In those interim years, Monte Carlo served as the first round of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge (IRC) season, a championship aimed at developing young and amateur rally drivers. France\u2019s Loeb dominated the race prior to its spell away from WRC, claiming five wins in six years. \u201cThe Monte Carlo rally has to be in the world championship,\u201d the Citroen driver said in quotes report by AFP.  \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a no-brainer. \u201cIt is the world\u2019s most famous rally; you just can\u2019t have a world championship without it.\u201d This year marks the 80th edition of the race in its current format, but rally driving in Monte Carlo dates back to 1911. Since then the Mediterranean port has become deeply entrenched in motorsport folklore. \u201cIndianapolis, Le Mans, Monza, Monaco F1 Grand Prix, Monte Carlo Rally, (these are) indestructible legends, pearls of the crown,\u201d Hajjar said. \u201cThe rally and all other events organized by the Automobile Club participated in making Monaco one of the capital cities in motorsport.\u201d This year\u2019s course spans 430 kilometers (267 miles) and comprises of 18 timed stages. Sunday\u2019s final stage will pit the three top-performing drivers against each other over 5.2 km in a \u201cPower Stage\u201d between Sainte Agnes and Col de la Madone. Loeb\u2019s Citroen teammate Mikko Hirvonen is thrilled to see the race return to WRC, although he admitted to having mixed feelings when he spoke ahead of the action getting under way. \u201cI have a kind of love and hate relationship with the rally,\u201d the 31-year-old Finn said. \u201cI mean I love it when I\u2019m not there but when you\u2019re up in the mountains with the wrong tires doing icy downhill with the slick tire then I hate it.  \u201cBut it\u2019s a real challenge and I\u2019m very happy to start the season over there.\u201d After Monte Carlo, the WRC season moves to Sweden on February 9, with the world championship coming to a close in Spain on November 11."

Rescue workers previously suspended their search when sensors on board the vessel measured movement, Massimo Maccheroni, of the Coast Guard general command, told CNN. \u201cWhen this happens all rescue forces have to leave the ship, (so as) not to put their lives in danger,\u201d he said. Underwater searches will not resume until Saturday, the Italian coast guard said.  The authorities are now assessing their options. One possibility being considered is an attempt to anchor the vessel to the rocks off Giglio island using chains. But, warned Maccheroni, \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult. The Concordia weighs 110,000 tons and it\u2019s like a 300 meter-high skyscraper in an horizontal position.\u201d Italian authorities are considering when to call off the search for survivors and start the recovery operation, which would mean salvage workers can start emptying the ship\u2019s huge fuel tanks. Coast Guard Captain Cosimo Nicastro said that preparation for the fuel removal operation is underway, though it has not started yet. A vessel with a huge tank still needs to come to the island to store the fuel. This will happen in the coming days, he said.  At least 11 people are known to have died in the disaster, and 21 are still missing, according to the Italian Crisis Unit.  A week after the ship ran aground off the Tuscan coast, it appeared increasingly unlikely that any survivors will still be found aboard the ship. On Friday, more relatives of the missing passengers arrived on the island.  \u201cIt\u2019s terrible, we spend all day with relatives of those that have someone still missing and of those that have been identified,\u201d Giglio Vice Mayor Marco Pellegrini said.  A little bar located on the harbor was drawing a bit of business selling hot drinks and coffee.  A private boat carrying French, Italian and Peruvian relatives of the dead and missing, chartered by the Italian authorities, sailed from Porto Santo Stefano on the mainland Friday lunchtime, to Giglio. Cook: Captain ordered dinner after crash A spokesman for the mayor of Giglio said the families had scattered flowers on the water by the wreck site. Also on the boat was Susy Albertini, the mother of a missing 5-year-old Italian girl, Dayana Arlotti. The girl\u2019s father, Albertini\u2019s ex-husband, William Arlotti, is also unaccounted for. \u201cDayana was very happy and excited for this trip,\u201d said Davide Veschi, lawyer for Susy Albertini. \u201cShe packed all her nicest clothes last Thursday. We know from other passengers that she was wearing a life vest but her father no. They are not experienced swimmers. Susy tried to reach the father\u2019s mobile many times that night, but nobody answered.\u201d Eight of the dead have so far been named \u2013 four French passengers, a Spanish passenger, and Italian and one crew member each from Hungary and Peru. Criticism from both Costa Cruises and the authorities has focused so far on Capt. Francesco Schettino, who is under house arrest and facing possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship. His lawyer, Bruno Leporatti, spoke to Sky Tg24 on Friday, urging people to reserve judgment on the captain until they have all the facts. \u201cObviously, before we can talk about responsibilities, we need to make sure that there is a series of facts that are corroborated. Until now we only have one fact: the fact that the ship Concordia hit a rock. What were the causes of the collision: a wrong maneuver? A missing sign on the sea maps? High speed? A sudden change of route? Improvised route? I am not able to determine this,\u201d Leporatti told the Italian news channel. \u201cIt will be the technical examinations that will in their entirety clarify the dynamic of the events,\u201d Leporatti reportedly said. Further doubt was cast on Schettino\u2019s leadership late Thursday when a cook from the ship told a Filipino television station that the captain ordered dinner for himself and a woman at about 10:30 p.m., less than an hour after the collision. \u201cWe wondered what was going on,\u201d cook Rogelio Barista told GMA Network. \u201cAt that time, we really felt something was wrong. \u2026 The stuff in the kitchen was falling off shelves and we realized how grave the situation was.\u201d However, a Moldovan woman Domnica Cemortan, 25, who also works for the Costa cruise line but said she was on the Concordia as a passenger, defended the captain in a TV interview. \u201cI\u2019ve heard in Russian media that the captain left the ship first, or among the first. But this is not true,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a witness \u2013 I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m invited to testify in the court or not, but as a witness I can say that I left the deck at 11:50 p.m. following an order from the captain who told me to go to the third deck to get into a lifeboat that could take more people.\u201d Cemortan said she had gone to the deck to help translate the captain\u2019s orders after hearing a coded announcement that raised the alarm for crew members. Coast guard records published Thursday by an Italian newspaper added to the pressure on Schettino and his officers, suggesting authorities first became aware of the crash from a friend of the mother of a passenger about 15 minutes after the ship hit rocks.  The Coast Guard identified the ship in trouble and contacted it, asking if there were problems on board, at 10:14 p.m. \u2013 more than half an hour after the 9:41 p.m. collision \u2013 according to a Coast Guard log published in the newspaper La Repubblica. The ship responded that it was experiencing a \u201cblack out,\u201d according to the log and said the crew believed it could solve the problem in a short time. The log does not indicate which crew member was speaking. What appears to be the audio of that first radio call between the Costa Concordia and the Coast Guard was broadcast on Italian media Thursday. A Coast Guard official is heard to ask: \u201cWhat kind of a problem is it? Just something with the generator? The police of Prato have received a phone call from the relatives of a sailor who said that during the dinner everything was falling on his head.\u201d The unidentified crew member responds: \u201cWe have a black out and we are checking the conditions on board.\u201d \u201cThe passengers say they have been told to put on the life vests, is this correct?\u201d the Coast Guard then asks, to which the crew member repeats the same answer, before promising to keep the Coast Guard updated. In Schettino\u2019s hometown of Meta di Sorrento, residents were standing by the cruise ship captain. A spray-painted sheet left hanging outside the home where Schettino is under house arrest says, \u201cCaptain, don\u2019t give up.\u201d \u201cIt looks like the only one responsible is the captain. That\u2019s what everyone on the outside think,\u201d Mayor Paolo Trapani said. \u201cBut in this village, people know he cannot be responsible for everything. It\u2019s not like journalists want to portray it.\u201d The decision to give up the search for survivors is expected to come by the weekend, when the weather is forecast to deteriorate. Declaring the operation to be recovery rather than rescue would allow salvage experts to start pumping fuel out of the ship, potentially averting an environmental catastrophe. The ship was carrying about 2,300 tons of fuel when it hit rocks. Prosecutors have accused the captain of piloting the ship too fast to allow him to react to dangers, causing the shipwreck, according to legal papers. Judge Valeria Montesarchio\u2019s initial ruling found Schettino changed the ship\u2019s course, steering too close to shore and causing the ship to hit a rock. Costa Cruises chairman Pier Luigi Foschi earlier this week placed the blame for the wreck squarely on the captain, saying it was his choice to deviate from frequently traveled routes.  There were roughly 4,200 people on the Costa Concordia when it ran aground \u2013 about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members, the vast majority of whom made it off the ship safely."

        "content": "It could be the most eagerly-awaited match so far at this year\u2019s Australian Open. Rising teen star Bernard Tomic will take on one of the legends in men\u2019s tennis, Roger Federer, for a place in the quarterfinals. The 19-year-old Tomic will have the weight of the host nation\u2019s expectations on his shoulders, having battled to an epic 4-6 7-6 (7-0) 7-6 (8-6) 2-6 6-3 win over Ukrainian 13th seed Alexandr Dolgopolov on Friday. He reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon last year, where he lost to eventual winner and current No. 1 Novak Djokovic, but had never previously gone past round three in his home event. \u201cI looked up to him a lot. He was my idol. So to play him and have a feel  for him in a match like this is good for me,\u201d Tomic said of Federer, who has won a record 16 grand slam titles. \u201cTo me, he\u2019s the best player to play. I love watching Roger even on TV now  and in the past, so it\u2019s good to get the opportunity to play him again.\u201d Tomic played his 50th top-level match in his opening win over Spanish 22nd seed Fernando Verdasco, then ended the hopes of American Sam Querrey. Former world No. 1 Federer, by contrast, will play his 1,000th ATP Tour match when they meet in the last 16 on Sunday. The Swiss third seed, who beat Tomic in their only encounter in a Davis Cup match last year, advanced with a 7-6 (8-6) 7-5 6-3 win over big-serving Croatian Ivo Karlovic, ranked 57th. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot matches,\u201d Federer said of the upcoming landmark. \u201cHow do I feel? I feel good. I feel healthy.  I don\u2019t know if I can play another 1,000, but I feel like it\u2019s a lot of tennis.   \u201cI would like to play a lot more, but it\u2019s quite a number \u2026 I\u2019ve had my share of tough losses and also my great wins, so a bit of both.\u201d The 30-year-old is still some way short of Jimmy Connors\u2019 record total of 1,479 matches, being seventh on the list with an 813-186 tally. But he has double the American\u2019s total of grand slams. If Federer beats Tomic he will be on course for a semifinal clash with longtime rival and world No. 2 Rafael Nadal, who won 6-2 6-4 6-2 against 119th-ranked Slovakian Lukas Lacko. Nadal, a 10-time grand slam champion and a winner of this event in 2009, saw his match at the Rod Laver Arena briefly interrupted by a low-flying bird, but the Spaniard eventually progressed in just under two hours. \u201cI am playing well,\u201d said the second seed who, like Federer, is yet to drop a set this week.  \u201cIf you are playing well, things can be a little bit less difficult.  If you are playing bad, every match will be very, very difficult.\u201d Nadal will next face his 2011 Davis Cup-winning teammate Feliciano Lopez. The 18th seed beat No. 16 John Isner 6-3 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 6-7 (0-7) 6-1 in a match which lasted three hours and 26 minutes and ended U.S. hopes in the men\u2019s draw. Czech world No. 7 Tomas Berdych, a quarterfinalist in 2011, won 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (7-1) 6-1 against South African 30th seed Kevin Anderson to set up a match with Nicolas Almagro. The Spanish 10th seed, who has reached the fourth round for the third year in a row, beat Swiss world No. 22 Stanislas Wawrinka 7-6 (7-2) 6-2 6-4. Argentina\u2019s 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro was rarely troubled as he dispatched Chinese Taipei\u2019s world No. 79 Yen-Hsun Lu 6-2 6-3 6-0. The 11th seed will next play 41st-ranked German Philipp Kohlschreiber, who beat Colombian No. 71 Alejandro Falla 6-3 6-2 7-6 (7-3)."

        "content": "The breaking of plates may be a popular tradition practiced in his homeland, but Cypriot tennis player Marcos Baghdatis has just taken the pastime to a whole new level.   Playing against Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka at the Australian Open in Melbourne on Wednesday night, Baghdatis was down two sets and looking shaky in the third when he let loose with a spectacular outburst.  Sitting in his chair at a changeover, Baghdatis destroys his racket by smashing it into the blue Margaret Court Arena surface seven times, before calmly handing it to the ball boy. He follows through by giving another racket the same treatment.     But it doesn\u2019t end there \u2013 he repeats the process by demolishing two more rackets, not even bothering to unwrap them from their plastic first.   The colorful tantrum seemed to briefly help; he went on to take the third set, but finally lost to Wawrinka 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 5-7 6-1. On Thursday Baghdatis was penalized with an $800 fine, a figure much smaller than the hundreds of thousands of hits his performance has attracted on YouTube.     YouTube: Watch Baghdatis destroy rackets The former Australian Open runner-up\u2019s official Website recounts his defeat to Wawrinka, but fails to mention his 60-second, racket-smashing eruption.

        "content": "Two bombs went off at separate locations in the Northern Ireland city of Londonderry, police said Thursday. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said people had been moved from both areas after telephone warnings and there were no reports of injuries. One of the blasts was on Strand Road, near government offices and police headquarters. The other was near a tourist office at Foyle Street. The police commander for the city, Chief Superintendent Stephen Martin, branded the attacks \u201creckless.\u201d He praised his officers for quickly evacuating businesses and homes, including many elderly residents. \u201cThankfully we are not dealing with mass casualties or worse this evening,\u201d said Martin. \u201cThe people of Derry do not want this - it is cowardly and callous.\u201d Londonderry, Northern Ireland\u2019s second largest city, has a Catholic majority and is known as Derry by many residents. Local politicians are blaming Irish Republican Army splinter groups for planting the bombs. There have been several attacks by so-called \u201cdissident republicans\u201d in the city during recent years since the mainstream IRA declared a cease-fire. The IRA for decades fought against British authorities in Northern Ireland, but has since renounced violence. The former Social Democratic and Labour Party mayor of the city, Irish nationalist Colum Eastwood, condemned Thursday\u2019s attacks. \u201cThis was an attack on the people of Derry by the enemies of Ireland. Those behind this are engaged in a futile and morally bankrupt campaign.\u201d Leader of the pro-British Ulster Unionist Party, Tom Elliott, said, \u201cI have no doubt the bombs are the work of so-called \u201cdissident\u201d republican terrorists. \u201cWe have seen this type of attack before during the troubles when the IRA blitzed Londonderry on a regular basis,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cThose attacks failed to break the will of the unionist people and these attacks will fail, too. These attacks further no cause.\u201d Elliott called for a security crackdown by British authorities and urged anyone with information on the bombers to give it to police. \u201cThis type of fascism was part of our past. It has no place in our future,\u201d he added."

        "content": "This weekend\u2019s kick-off at the 28th Africa Cup of Nations launches a three-week explosion of color and noise in the soccer-crazy continent. The tournament is set to transfix the region as 16 teams go head-to-head to be crowned footballing kings of Africa, but there is also a tinge of trepidation in the air. That\u2019s because the 2010 installment in Angola was overshadowed by a machine gun attack on the Togo team bus that left three people dead and organizers \u2013 the Confederation of African Football (CAF) \u2013 having to defend the decision to stage it there. This year\u2019s co-hosts Equatorial Guinea and Gabon are the smallest nations ever to hold the event \u2013 which is also known as AFCON \u2013 giving rise to concerns about security, as well as travel and tourism infrastructure. CNN examines the complex nature of the event, investigating the issues on and off the field. The hosts Oil-rich Equatorial Guinea and Gabon are the smallest countries ever to ever host the Africa Cup of Nations, with a combined population of just over two million.  The fact they were chosen underlines the Confederation of African Football (CAF) policy to use the tournament as an investment tool, hoping to drive tourism and business long after the soccer extravaganza has gone. \u201cIt is only the second time that Central Africa has the honor to host the most prestigious competition on the continent. The first time was 40 years ago in my country, Cameroon,\u201d CAF spokesman Habuba Suleiman told CNN. \u201cIt has become something unique allowing us to complete our major language areas; Arabic, Anglophone, Francophone, Lusophone and today Hispanic with Equatorial Guinea. \u201cEach of the co-hosts could perhaps not afford to host a competition of 16 teams alone. We had a first experience in 2000 (hosted by Ghana and Nigeria) and it was not entirely satisfactory. This time the two countries have cooperated very well as evidenced by the decision to grant common visas to both countries. This is a great step forward.\u201d But there is pressure on them to deliver a successful and safe Cup of Nations after 2010\u2019s pre-tournament tragedy in Angola \u2013 which had only recently emerged from a civil war lasting three decades. According to African football expert Mark Gleeson, who has been to every tournament since 1992, CAF\u2019s decision to take the tournament to new territories has had mixed success. \u201cWhen you award AFCON to places like Burkina Faso, Mali, Angola or Gabon, you find that coffers for sporting infrastructure that would be normally be difficult to open suddenly emerge and you\u2019re leaving a legacy of football infrastructure,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cCAF have actively pursued that line over the last two decades, sometimes to the detriment of the tournament \u2013 in Gabon there isn\u2019t a hotel room for neither love nor money.  \u201cLuckily in Africa there are not too many traveling fans so that\u2019s not much of a problem, but infrastructure is poor: how do you get from one venue to the next? \u201cThere isn\u2019t the immense pressure on traveling fans as there would be in Europe. What would you rather have \u2013 a stadium that allows a nation to participate competitively in football versus disgruntled visitors that can\u2019t find a hotel room for two weeks?\u201d The culture of chaos The deadly attack on Togo\u2019s team led to questions about the tournament\u2019s organization and security, but according to Gleeson, the Africa Cup of Nations can\u2019t be judged by similar standards to the World Cup or the European Championships. \u201cThe tournament has a unique, chaotic charm, maybe that has an appeal,\u201d he said. \u201cMy experience is that nothing is ever ready \u2013 it is all a patch-up job.  \u201cBut if the football kicks off at the appointed time, the TV cameras are in place and the whistle is blown, it doesn\u2019t matter whether the accreditation machine broke down five hours before. \u201cI think there\u2019s far too much emphasis on all the other sideshows that there needs to be. It\u2019s important to have the competition taking place, to have a good intensity that African football followers will enjoy.\u201d Suleiman said security arrangements are the responsibility of the host nations, not the ruling body. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an army to check security. We are a group of peaceful people who are convinced that football has to be a factor of unity, friendship and fraternity,\u201d he told CNN.  \u201cWe were all ruffled by what happened in Angola. It was a tragedy that touched us profoundly. I hope that never repeats itself. The opportunity There may be huge pressure on the co-hosts, but the pride they feel at staging the African soccer showcase is palpable.  Gabon spent an estimated $500 million on stadiums and infrastructure despite them being tiny in comparison to hosts of other major tournaments, like China, who spent an estimated $42 billion on the 2008 Olympics. Hugues Dowe, from Gabon\u2019s local organizing committee, told CNN that hosting of the Cup of Nations is \u201csomething exceptional.\u201d \u201cFinally hosting the tournament means so many opportunities for Gabon and its people,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you host the Cup of Nations you can\u2019t expect benefits immediately. But we have built big infrastructure in terms of hosting the tournament like roads, stadiums and hotels.  \u201cThese big investments are very important for development of our country, particularly in sports and tourism sectors.\u201d \u201cThe security in Gabon will be the best organized of any country which hosted the tournament before us. Dowe also insisted there would be enough hotel rooms to accommodate the 80,000 expected visitors, as well as the many journalists descending on the competition, while the four stadiums that are hosting matches across the two countries are open and ready for kick-off. \u201cI have never heard of problems without solutions,\u201d Suleiman said. \u201cIn Africa, small problems always end up being arranged. \u201cCAF belongs to each of the 53 national associations. They all have the right to bid to host without any exception. With each new edition of the competition, the AFCON has become a factor of economic development in terms of structures and infrastructures.  \u201cWe would not have had all these beautiful stadiums in Africa without the AFCON. Roads have been constructed, medical facilities built, zones electrified and development of new technologies accelerated. It is something CAF can legitimately be proud of.\u201d The tournament AFCON is the planet\u2019s third biggest football tournament, behind the World Cup and the European Championships. The biennial competition is contested by 16 teams split into four groups. Each country will host matches in two cities. Saturday\u2019s opening Group A matches will be in Equatorial Guinea\u2019s former capital Bata, while other games will be held in Malabo \u2013 its 1969 successor. In Gabon a new 40,000-seater stadium has been built in the capital Libreville, with help from the Chinese government, and will host the final. In Franceville, the Stade de Franceville has been refurbished to hold 35,000 spectators. The top two teams from each group go through to the quarterfinal stage. The final will be held in Gabon\u2019s capital, Libreville, on February 12. The teams The qualified nations are: Group A \u2013 Equatorial Guinea, Libya, Zambia, Senegal; Group B \u2013 Ivory Coast, Sudan, Burkina Faso, Angola; Group C \u2013 Gabon, Niger, Morocco, Tunisia; Group D \u2013 Ghana, Botswana, Mali, Guinea. There is a notable list of absentees. Egypt, who won the last three titles, failed to qualify along with African heavyweights Cameroon, South Africa and Nigeria. The rise of African football in recent years means some of the world\u2019s biggest soccer stars will be on show, such as the Ivory Coast\u2019s Chelsea striker Didier Drogba and Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure, as well as Mali\u2019s Seydou Keita, who plays for European and Spanish champions Barcelona.

Goalkeeper Julio  Cesar, defenders Lucio and Walter Samuel and strikers Diego Milito and  Giampaolo Pazzini were among those given a night off by Ranieri, but Inter still proved too good for their rivals, who also made a host of changes to their side. Inter took the lead in the ninth minute when Brazilian defender Maicon let fly with a superb 25-yard shot that gave Cristiano Lupatelli no chance in the Genoa goal. Who are football\u2019s top January transfer targets? And the home side doubled their lead five minutes after the break when Andrea Poli played a one-two with Joel Obi before volleying home his first goal for the club. Genoa pulled a consolation goal back in injury time when Lucas Pratto\u2019s shot hit the crossbar and   Valter Birsa reacted first to score from close range. But Inter held on for victory and they now face a tricky trip to Napoli in next week\u2019s quarterfinal tie.

England\u2019s Tom Lewis and South African pair Thomas Aiken and Branden Grace \u2013 the winner of last week\u2019s Joburg Open \u2013 lead the chasing pack, with former British Open champions Padraig Harrington and Louis Oosthuizen among a group of four players a further stroke behind in the 35-player event only open to European Tour winners. \u201cThis is probably the best round I\u2019ve ever had \u2013 it\u2019s quite a serious test of golf,\u201d Colsaerts, who vies with Alviro Quiros of Spain as the longest hitters in Europe,\u201d told the European Tour website.  \u201cI can reach most of the par-fives in two so it\u2019s quite a bonus when you get to birdie the par-threes,\u201d he added. Grace, who only qualified for the tournament after winning last  week, told reporters: \u201cI missed a couple of short ones but I kept hitting the ball well and giving myself chances. It will be nice to see how I can follow it up.\u201d Home favorite Ernie Els dropped two shots on the first three holes but birdies on the final three holes saw him finish on two-under 71. Colsaerts\u2019 opening lead is the eighth-largest advantage after 18 holes in the history of the European Tour."

The Frenchman \u2013 bidding for a sixth victory in the race \u2013 claimed five of the six stages to move over a minute-and-a-half ahead of nearest challenger Dani Sordo, with Petter Solberg in third place. \u201cToday was easier than yesterday, more like a normal tarmac rally but it was still tricky because it was very muddy in places,\u201d Citreon driver Loeb told the official World Rally Championship website. \u201cI was feeling good so I tried to push. I don\u2019t know what will happen tomorrow, so with the conditions suiting me today I tried to take everything I can.\u201d Mini driver Sordo is one minute and 37 seconds behind in second place, while the Ford of Solberg is a mere three seconds adrift in third, after the Swede and Spaniard Sordo swapped positions throughout the course of an intriguing day. Finland\u2019s Mikko Hirvonen is fourth in the second Citroen, with Russian Evgeny Novikov just six seconds further back in his M-Sport Fiesta. However, the rally is over for Sebastien Ogier, who was lying in sixth place when his Skoda crashed 5km from the finish of the final stage. Thankfully the Frenchman, and co-driver Julien Ingrassia, escaped uninjured from the accident. "

        "content": "FIFA and World Cup host nation Brazil are on a collision course over whether alcohol should be served in stadiums during the 2014 finals. Legislation passed by the Brazilian government in 2003 prohibits the sale of all alcohol in football arenas. And with beer company Budweiser one of FIFA\u2019s main sponsors for the tournament, this creates a problem for football\u2019s world governing body. Will Africa\u2019s new stars shine at Cup of Nations? FIFA has been battling for a change in the Brazilian law, with General Secretary Jerome Valcke currently in the South American nation to press for progress on new legislation. However, some members of the Brazilian Congress are campaigning for the law to remain the same,  a situation which is complicating arrangements for the month-long soccer showpiece. FIFA beer battle about cash, not game The situation looks set to rumble on, although FIFA sent CNN a statement saying it believes the law will be changed very soon. \u201cThe selling of beer in stadiums is part of the fan culture and will also be part of the 2014 FIFA World Cup,\u201d the statement said.  \u201cIt is important to note that the sale of alcohol will be limited to beer only as was done at all previous FIFA World Cups.   \u201cWe are confident that we will be able to solve the very few open matters and close the chapter of the 2014 Bill by March 2012, so we can then focus on the operational aspects of staging the FIFA Confederations Cup in 18 months from now and then the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\u201d  The statement continued: \u201cAt this point let us stress again that our requirements have not changed since 2007 when President Lula signed the government guarantees and are actually the same as we request from any other FIFA World Cup host in past.\u201d Brazilian Minister for Sports Aldo Rebelo echoed FIFA\u2019s statement, telling CNN: \u201cThe FIFA World Cup bill is a compromise the country committed to when it was bidding for hosting the event.  \u201cIt is important to note Brazil asked to host this event and at the time we agreed with all the requirements. Our goal was to have the bill approved by end of last year, so in terms of law we are not as far ahead as we are in terms of stadiums.  \u201cWe need to move on and fasten up and I am confident that by March we can complete this.\u201d The delay in changing the alcohol legislation is not the first time Brazil and FIFA have seemingly been at loggerheads since the five-times World Cup winners were awarded the tournament. The Brazilian government is in dispute with FIFA over the issue of cut-price tickets for senior citizens and students, while FIFA has still not received the assurances it was seeking over sponsors having their trademarks protected."

        "content": "A British lawmaker said Thursday that he and 17 others have been awarded payouts over phone hacking by the News of the World newspaper, in settlements totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars. News International, the parent company of the now defunct News of the World newspaper, issued a statement confirming that a subsidiary had agreed to settlements, but did not provide details. A number of people have brought civil cases against News International over alleged phone hacking by its employees. Chris Bryant, a Labour Party member of Parliament, posted on Twitter: \u201cNews of the World apologises to me and 17 others in the High Court - and pays damages plus costs, with no hush clause.\u201d In another post, Bryant said News of the World \u201cadmitted in court today that my phone was hacked and privacy intruded.\u201d He listed former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, actor Jude Law, the actor\u2019s ex-wife, Sadie Frost, and high-profile rugby player Gavin Henson as among the 18 people in court. News International, in its statement, said that News Group Newspapers, its subsidiary that was the publisher of News of the World, \u201cagreed (to) settlements in respect of a number of claims against the company.\u201d It added that the company \u201cmade no admission as part of these settlements that directors or senior employees knew about the wrongdoing by NGN or sought to conceal it.  However, for the purpose of reaching these settlements only, NGN agreed that the damages to be paid to claimants should be assessed as if this was the case.\u201d The office of Mark Thomson, the lawyer who is representing many of the claimants, gave details of their payouts. The office said Law received \u00a3130,000, while Frost was awarded \u00a350,000. Law\u2019s personal assistant, Ben Jackson, was given \u00a340,000, while a former PR adviser to Law and his ex-partner, Sienna Miller, Ciara Parkes, received \u00a335,000. Henson was awarded \u00a340,000, as were Guy Pelly, a friend of Prince William, and Joan Hammell, a former chief of staff to Prescott. Lisa Gower, who was linked to actor Steve Coogan, was given \u00a330,000, the lawyer\u2019s office said. According to court documents posted online by the Guardian newspaper, freelance journalist Tom Rowlands \u2013 who had worked for fellow News International titles the Times and Sunday Times \u2013 was given \u00a325,000 damages after News of the World hacked his voice mail to get information it then used in stories it published itself. In a statement read outside the High Court by his legal team, Jude Law called the behavior of News of the World \u201cappalling\u201d and said he had brought legal proceedings \u201cto try to find out the truth.\u201d The group of lawyers representing the claimants said they had obtained documents from News International that revealed its attempts to destroy evidence, partly thanks to the fact that the 12 legal firms involved joined forces to work together.  \u201cAs a result, documents relating to the nature and scale of the conspiracy, a coverup and the destruction of evidence/e-mail archives by News Group have now been disclosed to the claimants,\u201d said the lawyers\u2019 statement, read outside court. \u201cIn the face of this overwhelming evidence, the \u2018rogue reporter\u2019 position has disintegrated and the range, scale and extent of phone-hacking has become clear.\u201d James Murdoch, chief executive of News International and the son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, has insisted that the practice of phone hacking was not widespread. News International scrapped the best-selling News of the World Sunday tabloid in July amid outrage over claims it had hacked into the voice mail of a missing 13-year-old girl who turned out to have been murdered. Mark Thomson said other claimants would press ahead with a trial scheduled for next month, and praised the courage of all those taking on \u201ca massive and influential multinational media organization.\u201d Thursday\u2019s hearing followed the settlement of a number of other claims against  News Group Newspapers, which also publishes the Sun. Among them was the claim brought by Law\u2019s ex-fiancee, Miller. Law\u2019s statement said: \u201cFor several years leading up to 2006, I was suspicious about how information concerning my private life was coming out in the press. I changed my phones, I had my house swept for bugs but still the information kept being published. I started to become distrustful of people close to me. \u201cI was truly appalled by what I was shown by the police and by what my lawyers have discovered. It is clear that I, along with many others, was kept under constant surveillance for a number of years.\u201d Prescott, in an interview with the Hull Daily Mail newspaper in his former constituency, said he had been awarded \u00a340,000 in damages, plus his legal costs. \u201cToday\u2019s court decision at long last brings clarity, apology and compensation for the years of hacking into my telephone messages by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Group Newspapers,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cIt follows years of aggressive denials and a cavalier approach to private information and the law. These denials were supported by the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) and the inaction of senior officers of the Metropolitan Police.\u201d A public inquiry was set up in the wake of the scandal to examine British media ethics and behavior.  Senior executives and editors for News International and other media organizations, both current and former, have testified before the Leveson Inquiry, a wide-ranging government-backed investigation of British press ethics and practices, as have many of the alleged victims of phone hacking and other abuses by the press. The Metropolitan Police is also conducting investigations into phone-hacking claims and allegations that police officers were bribed for information."

Former No. 1 Clijsters, seeded 11th after long injury absences last year, won 6-3 6-2 against Slovakian 20th seed Daniela Hantuchova. Fifth seed Li, who lost to the Belgian in straight sets before becoming Asia\u2019s first major winner at the French Open, had even easier progress when opponent Anabel Medina Garrigues retired in the first set due to a injury. The Spanish 26th seed, who had beaten China\u2019s world No. 6 in their previous four encounters, rolled her ankle at 2-0 down and had a long medical timeout before losing the next game and quitting in floods of tears. Teen star Tomic earns last-16 clash with legend Federer \u201cLast year in the final I think for me was a good match to remember,\u201d Li told reporters. \u201cAfter that match I was feeling I really can win a grand slam. \u201cI think we play the same way, like playing against a mirror.  What can I do? \u2026 Only thing is I just try my best tennis on the court.\u201d Four-time grand slam champion Clijsters felt there was still room for improvement in her game despite recording a third successive straight-sets win. \u201cI felt like I kind of just had to find my aggressive footwork and positioning on the court,\u201d the 28-year-old said. \u201cBut I was able to at the important points win those points and make the right decisions.  \u201cObviously at the end of the day, when you\u2019re not playing your best, what it comes down to is just trying to play the important points as well as possible. I was able to do that today.\u201d Top seed Caroline Wozniacki will face either Clijsters or Li in the quarterfinals if she can get the better of Serbia\u2019s former world No. 1 Jelena Jankovic. The Dane, seeking a first grand slam title and needing to reach the last eight to have a chance of staying top of the rankings, beat Romanian 31st seed Monica Niculescu 6-2 6-2.   \u201cI want to try to do my best here,\u201d the 21-year-old said. \u201cWhatever happens, happens. For me, the most important thing is to keep improving. If I do that, I know I can play on a very high level.\u201d No. 13 Jankovic, a semifinalist in 2008, won 6-2 6-0 against 42nd-ranked American Christina McHale, who had reached the third round of the Australian Open for the first time in her career. Third seed Victoria Azarenka kept alive her hopes of moving to world No. 1 with a 6-2 6-4 defeat of German Hobart International winner Mona Barthel. The Belorussian will next play 46th-ranked Czech Iveta Benesova, who won 6-1 6-3 against Russia\u2019s Nina Bratchikova. Polish eighth seed Agnieszka Radwanska beat Kazakhstan\u2019s world No. 57 Galina Voskoboeva 6-2 6-2 to set up a clash with Germany\u2019s rising star Julia Gorges, who is in the fourth round of a grand slam for the first time. The 22nd seed came from behind to win 3-6 6-3 6-1 against 80th-ranked Romina Oprandi, who eliminated fellow Italian Francesca Schiavone earlier this week."

Defending champion Djokovic was broken early in the first set against Colombian world No. 56 Santiago Giraldo and fell 2-3 behind, but the four-time grand slam winner responded in ruthless fashion to seal a 6-3 6-2 6-1 win. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019ve had lots of situations where I was a break down in my career, so I guess that doesn\u2019t affect me,\u201d the 24-year-old told reporters.   \u201cEspecially early in the first set, I knew that I will start hitting the ball better.\u201d The Serbian will look for a 10th win in a row at the Melbourne grand slam when he takes on 81st-ranked Frenchman Nicolas Mahut, who beat Japan\u2019s Tatsuma Ito 1-6 7-6 (8-6) 6-2 6-2. Britain\u2019s Murray, beaten by Djokovic in last year\u2019s final, was in equally imperious form as he breezed past France\u2019s world No. 101 Edouard Roger-Vasselin to reach the last 32. World No. 4 Murray rarely looked troubled as he wrapped up a 6-1 6-4 6-4 victory in just under two hours.  \u201cI served well today and obviously got off to a better start,\u201d said Murray. \u201cI thought towards the end of the second set, beginning of the third especially, he started playing much better.  \u201cHe was taking the ball early, trying to come to the net, which made it difficult. Because I served well, I set the point up with my first serve pretty well. I got quite a few short replies off of that. That was probably why I hit more winners. The unforced errors were down.\u201d The three-time grand slam finalist also has French opposition in the next round in world No. 46 Michael Llodra, who overcame Russian 32nd seed Alex Bogomolov Jr. 6-1 3-6 6-4 5-7 6-4 in a marathon three hours and 13 minutes.  American Andy Roddick, a four-time semifinalist at the season\u2019s first grand slam, was forced to withdraw from his contest with fellow former world No.1 Lleyton Hewitt. Two-time grand slam winner Hewitt, who needed a wildcard entry due to his current low ranking of 181,  led 3-6 6-3 6-4 before 15th seed Roddick retired due to a injury sustained after falling in the second set. The Australian will next face Canadian rising star Milos Raonic. The 23rd seed, named ATP newcomer of the year in 2011, won 6-4 5-7 6-2 7-5 against Germany\u2019s world No. 63 Philipp Petzschner. French sixth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga won 7-5 6-4 6-4 against 108th-ranked Brazilian Ricardo Mello.  The 2008 runner-up will meet Portugal\u2019s world No.107 Frederico Gil, who caused an upset by beating Spanish 26th seed Marcel Granollers 6-3 4-6 6-4 6-3. David Ferrer, a 2011 Davis Cup winner with Spain, was stretched by 68th-ranked American Ryan Sweeting before winning 6-7 (4-7) 6-2 3-6 6-2 6-3. The fifth seed earned a contest with Argentina\u2019s No. 27 Juan Ignacio Chela, who ousted 45th-ranked Spaniard Pablo Andujar 6-4 6-4 6-3. Serbian ninth seed Janko Tipsarevic ended the hopes of Australian debutant James Duckworth \u2013 who turns 20 on Saturday \u2013 with a 3-6 6-2 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 win.  Tipsarevic will play French 17th seed Richard Gasquet as he aims to go beyond the third round in Melbourne for the first time. Gasquet led world No. 146 Andrey Golubev by two sets before the Kazakh was forced to retire. Twelfth seed Gilles Simon suffered a shock defeat by 39th-ranked fellow Frenchman Julien Benneteau, who blew a two-set lead before taking the decider 6-2.  The 30-year-old Benneteau, seeking to make the fourth round for the first time, will play Japanese 24th seed Kei Nishikori \u2013 who came from two sets down to beat Australia\u2019s 94th-ranked Matthew Ebden 3-6 1-6 6-4 6-1 6-1. Serbian 19th seed Viktor Troicki went out in five sets against Kazakhstan\u2019s world No. 92 Mikhail Kukushkin, who earned a meeting with 14th seed Gael Monfils after the Frenchman beat Brazil\u2019s Thomaz Bellucci 2-6 6-0 6-4 6-2.

The 13-time grand slam winner survived a second-set rally from world No. 49 Strycova to wrap up victory in 68 minutes and emulate the achievement of her older sister Venus \u2013 who has 598 overall, but is not playing in Melbourne.  \u201cIt\u2019s like the ultimate,\u201d said 12th seed Serena, who made her professional debut in 1995 at the age of 13 and picked up her first win against Russia\u2019s Elena Likhovteva at a WTA Tour event in Chicago in 1997.  \u201cIt\u2019s really, really cool. The first thing I asked, of course, is there anyone that achieved a thousand? I guess not. I never will get there, either. But it\u2019s really cool. Five hundred is a lot of matches to play, let alone to win, so it\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d In fact, Martina Navratilova is the leading woman in the post-1968 Open era with 1,442 career victories, while the Williams sisters \u2013 who have battled serious injuries and illness in recent years \u2013 do not feature in the top 10.

The 2011 Wimbledon champion, who will move above Denmark\u2019s Caroline Wozniacki at the top of the world rankings if she wins her second grand slam, advanced to a last-32 clash with Russian 27th seed Maria Kirilenko. \u201cShe played very well in the second set,\u201d the 21-year-old Kvitova told reporters.  \u201cIt was very tough for me to get back in the third.  I mean, she was a very, very good opponent.\u201d World No. 29 Kirilenko battled past 102nd-ranked Canadian Aleksandra Wozniak 6-4 1-6 6-2. Her fourth-seeded compatriot Maria Sharapova crushed American qualifier Jamie Hampton 6-0 6-1 in just 64 minutes. The 2008 champion will next play German 30th seed Angelique Kerber, who won 7-5 6-1 against Canada\u2019s world No.91 Stephanie Dubois. Seventh seed Vera Zvonareva eased past the Czech Republic\u2019s 59th-ranked Lucie Hradecka 6-1 7-6 (7-3), and last year\u2019s semifinalist will take on fellow Russian Ekaterina Makarova \u2013 who beat Estonia\u2019s 25th seed Kaia Kanepi 6-2 7-5. French ninth seed Marion Bartoli ousted Australia\u2019s former world No. 4 Jelena Dokic 6-3 6-2 to earn a clash with China\u2019s 38th-ranked Zheng Jie, who beat Italian 23rd seed Roberta Vinci 6-4 6-2.

        "content": "The Australian Open provides a testing challenge for the world\u2019s top tennis players as they turn out for the first grand slam tournament of the season. The searing heat of the Melbourne summer sun, the high bounce of the blue Plexicushion hard-court playing surface and the boisterous atmosphere generated by the packed stands all blend together to make the January 14-29 event an unforgettable experience. It may not yet have prestige of the other three majors, but it is a place where stars are born and where legendary reputations are no guarantee of success \u2013 and the rewards have grown greater and greater. The 2012 edition is the 100th in the tournament\u2019s illustrious history, but what do you know about it? CNN Sport digs up nine items of interest about the southern hemisphere\u2019s biggest tennis event. Richest grand slam Although Wimbledon and the U.S. and French Opens have arguably more prestige than the Australian event, there is no doubt, that in monetary terms at least, the Melbourne grand slam leads the way. And it isn\u2019t just the singles champions who will be laughing all the way to the bank after their $2.2 million payouts. The men\u2019s and women\u2019s doubles winners will each receive $468,000 per pair, while the mixed doubles champions collect $140,000 per pair.  Fighting factions Melbourne is a melting pot of different cultures and nationalities, and has more ethnic diversity than any other city in Australia. When Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis reached the men\u2019s singles final against Roger Federer in 2006 he was cheered on by Melbourne\u2019s large Greek-Australian community. Sadly, in recent years, nationalistic rivalry has spilled over into sporadic fighting, notably between Serb and Croat fans. The heat is on As part of the Extreme Heat Policy, which was introduced in 1998, Melbourne organizers have a regulation which is referred to as a \u201cheat stress level.\u201d The measurement of heat stress is a combination of ambient air temperature, wind speed, humidity and the intensity of solar radiation. When daytime temperatures hit 35 degrees and the heat stress level reaches 28, then play can be suspended and the roofs on two of the main arenas closed for any new matches starting. Nomadic existence The tournament was initially known as the Australasian Championships, then became the Australian Championships and enjoyed a nomadic existence in its early years. As well as the 56 tournaments in Melbourne, the other 44 have been spread across several cities, including Sydney (17), Adelaide (14), Brisbane (7), Perth (3). Across the Tasman Sea, New Zealand\u2019s Christchurch and Hastings also hosted it in 1906 and 1912 respectively. Follow the crowd Once Melbourne was confirmed as the definitive home for the tournament, it soon became apparent that a new site needed to be constructed to accommodate the vast numbers of fans wanting to watch the action. In 1988 the tournament moved to the newly-built Melbourne Park complex and, since then, attendance figures have continued to soar. The main Rod Laver Arena has a seating capacity of 14,820, while the Hisense Arena can hold 11,000. Surface switches The tournament was played on grass until it left Kooyong. For the first two decades the new playing surface was the green Rebound Ace hard-court material, made by an Australian company, but in 2008 it changed to the U.S.-produced Plexicushion Prestige \u2013 which supposedly retains less heat and has better stability for players than its predecessor. Roger Federer and Serena Williams are the only players to have won the Australian title on both types of courts, while Sweden\u2019s Mats Wilander is unique in his wins on grass and Rebound Ace. Famous names honored The Australian Open singles trophies are named after Norman Brookes and Daphne Akhurst. Brookes was a legendary player in the formative years of the game. He was the first non-Briton to win Wimbledon in 1907, and in 1926 he became the first president of the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia \u2013 a post he held for the next 28 years. Akhurst dominated Australian tennis in the 1920s, winning five Australian Opens before tragically dying of an ectopic pregnancy at the age of 29. Hingis makes history Martina Hingis was just 16 years, three months old when she beat Mary Pierce in the 1997 women\u2019s final to become the youngest winner of a grand slam singles title. Remarkably the youngest men\u2019s winner is also the oldest. In 1953, the 18-year-old Ken Rosewall won the first of his four Australian Open titles. The last of his wins came in 1972 at the age of 37 years and two months, making Rosewall the oldest grand slam singles champion in history \u2013 while the 19-year span between his first and last title is also a record. Edmondson\u2019s shock victory Australian legend John Newcombe was expected to stroll to his third Australian Open title, and eighth grand slam success, in 1976. His unseeded 22-year-old opponent Mark Edmondson had been taken to five sets by Austrian Peter Feigl in his opening match but caused a major upset by dumping top seed Rosewall out in the semifinals. Newcombe was the hot favorite to retain his title but, after winning the opening set, Edmondson hit back to take the next three for a stunning triumph. Edmondson went on to become an accomplished doubles player, claiming four Australian Open titles in the 1980s, but he never won another grand slam singles title."

        "content": "Italian authorities are considering when to call off the search for survivors aboard the wreck of the cruise liner Costa Concordia, the coast guard said Thursday, as rescuers used explosives to blow new holes in the ship in search of victims. Authorities are mulling when to change the operation from rescue to recovery, coast guard spokesman Cosimo Nicastro said Thursday. Divers continued their search of the wreck into Thursday evening. At least 11 people are known to have died in the disaster, and 21 are still missing, according to the Italian Crisis Unit.  Coast guard records published Thursday by an Italian newspaper pile further pressure on the captain of the Concordia and his officers, suggesting authorities first became aware of the crash from a friend of the mother of a passenger about 15 minutes after the ship hit rocks. Also, a cook from the ship told a Filipino television station  the captain ordered dinner less than an hour after the collision. The coast guard identified the ship in trouble and contacted it, asking if there were problems on board, at 10:14 p.m. \u2013 more than half an hour after the 9:41 p.m. collision \u2013 according to a coast guard log published in the newspaper La Repubblica. The ship responded that it was experiencing a \u201cblack out,\u201d according to the log, and said the crew believed it could solve the problem in a short time. The log does not indicate which crew member was speaking. What appears to be the audio of that first radio call between the Costa Concordia and the coast guard was broadcast on Italian media Thursday. A coast guard official is heard to ask: \u201cWhat kind of a problem is it? Just something with the generator? The police of Prato have received a phone call from the relatives of a sailor who said that during the dinner everything was falling on his head.\u201d The unidentified crew member responds: \u201cWe have a black out and we are checking the conditions onboard.\u201d \u201cThe passengers say they have been told to put on the life vests, is this correct?\u201d the coast guard then asks, to which the crew member repeats the same answer, before promising to keep the coast guard updated. Criticism from both Costa Cruises and the authorities has focused so far on Capt. Francesco Schettino, who is under house arrest and facing possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship. Schettino ordered dinner for himself and a woman less than an hour after the collision, cook Rogelio Barista told GMA Network.  \u201cWe wondered what was going on. \u2026 At that time, we really felt something was wrong. \u2026 The stuff in the kitchen was falling off shelves and we realized how grave the situation was,\u201d Barista said. Authorities accuse the captain of piloting the ship too fast to allow him to react to dangers, causing the shipwreck, according to legal papers. Experts are performing toxicology tests on a sample of his hair, prosecutor Francesco Verusio said Thursday. Verusio is preparing a motion to have Schettino sent back to jail from house arrest, he said. Verusio also vowed to investigate the leak of legal documents related to the case, saying they did not come from his office. In Schettino\u2019s hometown of Meta di Sorrento, residents were standing by the captain of the capsized cruise ship. A spray-painted sheet left hanging outside the home where Schettino is under house arrest says, \u201cCaptain, don\u2019t give up.\u201d \u201cIt looks like the only one responsible is the captain. That\u2019s what everyone on the outside think,\u201d Mayor Paolo Trapani said. \u201cBut in this village, people know he cannot be responsible for everything. It\u2019s not like journalists want to portray it.\u201d Schettino\u2019s brother-in-law defended him in an Italian newspaper on Thursday. Schettino \u201cmanaged to avoid a tragedy \u2013 it could have been worse,\u201d  Maurilio Russo said in Corrierre della Sera. And he denied that the captain had abandoned ship. \u201cHe was not running away, he came down (from the ship) to survey the damage,\u201d Russo said. Russo also said the route the captain took was not out of the ordinary. \u201dIt is a usual procedure, the owners are well aware of it, it is useless to pretend otherwise,\u201d he said. \u201cPassengers pay to see something and skirting very close to the shore is part of the show.\u201d Read court documents on the case against Francesco Schettino (translation by La Repubblica) Schettino\u2019s parish priest, Don Gennaro Starita, accused the media of \u201ckilling him\u201d in an interview with an Italian newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame,\u201d he said. \u201cAlready there are all these dead people; do we want to add another one to the list?\u201d Also on Thursday, Italian officials identified two victims as Jeanne Gannard, 70, and Pierre Gregoire, 69, both from France, the Italian Crisis Unit said.  Eight victims have now been named \u2013 four French passengers, a Spanish passenger, and an Italian one, and one crew member each from Hungary and Peru. Nearly a week after the wreck, it appears increasingly unlikely that any survivors will still be found aboard the ship. Italian mother Susy Albertini, whose 5-year-old daughter Dayana Arlotti is reportedly the youngest person still missing, is among those desperate for news of their loved ones. \u201cI would like the rescuers to not stop looking and continue looking \u2013 my little girl, they need to bring her back home as soon as possible,\u201d she said. The girl\u2019s father, Albertini\u2019s ex-husband, William Arlotti, is also missing. Declaring the operation to be recovery rather than rescue would allow salvage experts to start pumping fuel out of the ship, potentially averting an environmental catastrophe.  The ship was carrying about 2,300 tons of fuel when it hit rocks off the coast of the Italian island of Giglio on Friday night. Prosecutors have accused the captain of piloting the ship to fast to allow him to react to dangers, causing the shipwreck, according to legal papers. Judge Valeria Montesarchio\u2019s initial ruling found Schettino changed the ship\u2019s course, steering too close to shore and causing the ship to hit a rock. Costa Cruises chairman Pier Luigi Foschi earlier this week placed the blame for the wreck squarely on the captain, saying it was his choice to deviate from frequently traveled routes.   \u201cWe believe it has been a human error here,\u201d Foschi said Monday. \u201cThe captain did not follow the authorized route, which is used by Costa ships very frequently. There\u2019s probably more than 100 times in one year we have this route.\u201d  There were roughly 4,200 people on the Costa Concordia when it ran aground \u2013 about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members, the vast majority of whom made it off the ship safely. Costa Cruises said it was contacting all passengers on the ship \u201cto make sure they have returned home and are well, and to confirm that they will receive a refund for the cruise and all material expenses relating to it.\u201d Carnival Corporation, the parent company of Costa Cruises, said Thursday that it will audit and review the safety and response procedures across all its cruise lines after last week\u2019s accident.  \u201cWhile I have every confidence in the safety of our vessels and the professionalism of our crews, this review will evaluate all practices and procedures to make sure that this kind of accident doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d Carnival CEO Micky Arison said in a statement."

        "content": "Thursday could be a key moment in the future of time keeping. More than 100 countries are due to decide on whether to keep the present method of adding so-called leap seconds to the global time system at the Radiocommunications Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. Currently, this Co-ordinated Universal Time or UTC is based on a system of extremely accurate atomic clocks. But they are so precise that they do not match the rotation of the Earth which periodically speeds up and slows down due to the action of the tides and changes within the Earth\u2019s core.  Since 1972 these extra seconds are added or taken away from the timescale to make sure UTC is synchronized with the Earth\u2019s rotation. Fifty years ago, a few seconds difference had less impact but many of our 21st century devices depend on incredible accuracy. Peter Whibberley, senior research scientist in the Time Group at the UK\u2019s National Physical Laboratory, explains that people like astronomers also rely on this level of precision. \u201cThere are many applications today that depend on precise time keeping. For example, telecommunications use atomic clocks to keep the networks around the world synchronized precisely together,\u201d he said. \u201cSatellite navigation \u2013 sat navs in our cars and homes \u2013 depend on signals being sent out from atomic clocks on board satellites.\u201d But now many countries, including the U.S. and most European nations, want to abandon the procedure which they say is too cumbersome.  According to Whibberley, precise timing systems can be disrupted by altering them. The UK, Canada and China are pressing to keep the leap seconds when the issue is discussed at the U.N.\u2019s International Telecommunications Union meeting on Thursday. \u201cWithout a correction, eventually our clocks would show the middle of the day occurring at night,\u201d said Whibberley. \u201cWe have to have some means of making a correction but at the moment no one knows how that\u2019s going to be done.\u201d Since 1972 Whibberley said only 24 leap seconds have been used and the rate has slowed because the Earth has been speeding up over the last few decades. Without the leap seconds adjustment, the precise time measured by atomic clocks and time according to the Earth\u2019s rotation will start to deviate. Although the tiniest inaccuracies might play havoc with our smart phones most of us would not notice the changes in our body clock \u2013 it is estimated it will take more than 200 years to register an hour\u2019s difference.

        "content": "A late goal from Eric Abidal gave Barcelona a 2-1 comeback victory in the first leg of their Spanish Cup quarterfinal clash with arch rivals Real Madrid. The French defender scored the decisive goal in the match known as \u2018El Clasico\u2019 at Real\u2019s Bernabeu stadium after Barcelona captain Carles Puyol had canceled out Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s opener. It means Barcelona are favorites to progress into the final four of the competition and eliminate the holders when the two contest the second leg next Wednesday. After a cagey opening, in which Barcelona dominated possession, Real took the lead with their first meaningful attack on 11 minutes. Karim Benzema\u2019s pass found Ronaldo scampering through the middle, and the Portuguese forward stepped past Gerard Pique before firing beyond Barca keeper Pinto. Ronaldo, who has been criticized by some fans for not celebrating some of his recent goals and for missing several chances in the last match with Barca, certainly looked like he enjoyed his opener. Five minutes later Barcelona striker Alexis Sanchez, from Chile, got on the end of Cesc Fabregas\u2019 pass but though his looping header beat Real goalkeeper Iker Casillas, it bounced back off the post. Lionel Messi had his first sight of goal on 26 minutes as his low shot forced Casillas into a smart save at his near post. Andres Iniesta then made some room inside the penalty area but he fired wide after Sanchez\u2019s lay off. But just three minutes into the second half Barcelona pulled level as their captain Carles Puyol stooped to head a corner into the net. Moments later Real defender Sergio Ramos deflected a volley from Iniesta onto the woodwork after a chipped pass from Fabregas. Real then hit the woodwork themselves as Benzema\u2019s header cannoned back off the upright with Pinto beaten. Tempers frayed when Real\u2019s Pepe appeared to stamp on Messi\u2019s hand as the Argentine was on the floor after a foul before Barca edged in front with just over ten minutes to go. Abidal, who signed a new contract at the club this week, controlled Messi\u2019s pass on his chest before shooting low into the net. In Italy, AC Milan progressed to the quarterfinals of the Italian Cup but they needed extra time to beat Novara 2-1. Stephan El Shaarawy gave the Rossoneri the lead on 24 minutes with a curling shot but Ivan Radovanovic equalized for Serie A\u2019s bottom club with a long range free kick two minutes from time. It was left to Milan\u2019s Brazilian striker Pato to seal victory, ten minutes into the extra half an hour."

        "content": "For days the giant carcass of the once-proud Costa Concordia has lain stricken off the rocky shore of the island of Giglio, rescue vessels bobbing in the chilly seas around it. The disaster that has claimed at least 11 lives, with some two dozen people still unaccounted for, has pushed the tiny island and its residents into an international spotlight \u201cWhen the tragedy happened everything was closed. We are a little island, calm in winter. The last bar closes at 9 p.m.,\u201d the island\u2019s mayor, Sergio Ortelli, told CNN. But as the luxury liner foundered on that fateful Friday night and rescuers scrambled to evacuate the ship\u2019s 4,200 passengers and crew, community leaders stepped up to offer all the help they could. \u201cWe are all friends. That night I was coordinating rescue operations on shore, my deputy went on board, and another member of our city hall was maneuvering the rescue boats,\u201d Ortelli said.  \u201cIt was very dangerous. People were smashed from lifeboat to the harbor\u2019s pier, like in an (amusement) park. I immediately called the bus company, the church, the hotels and the school and they all were immediately ready to cooperate.\u201d Many of the passengers brought ashore, some wearing only their pajamas, were given shelter in homes and buildings around the rocky, tree-covered island \u2013 which still has traces of Roman habitation \u2013 before being found a safe passage to the mainland by ferry. Read about a Hungarian among the ship dead Ortelli said the police presence on the island had ballooned one hundredfold, from a force that normally numbers 12 to some 1,200 officers.  The ongoing tragedy has shaken many of Giglio\u2019s 1,500 or so residents, most of whom live in the island\u2019s three villages. Elsa Pini, a 64-year-old local, had a tear in her eye as she pointed to the Costa Concordia on its side off a rocky promontory. \u201cEveryone on the island helped that night, by inviting survivors to warm up at home or giving them food. There were many little kids,\u201d she told CNN.  \u201cEvery morning when I see the wreck, it seems like if someone died. Now the island is full of people, rescuers, journalists, but it\u2019s not a feast, (there\u2019s) no happiness. \u201cThe dark on the harbor at night is terrible, it\u2019s an immense darkness. There are still dead in that wreck.\u201d  As the hopes of finding survivors fade, some are starting to wonder how long the ship\u2019s wreckage will remain offshore as a painful reminder of the tragedy. Fears have also been raised about the potential environmental impact, if the 2,300 tons of heavy fuel and oil carried by the ship should escape. The island, which lies nine miles off the Tuscan coast, is within the bounds of a marine wildlife sanctuary that is home to birds, whales and sharks. An oil leak could also blight the coves and sandy beaches that are popular with tourists who catch the ferry over from Porto Santo Stefano, on the mainland, during the summer months. Costa, the ship\u2019s owner, has pledged to prioritize protection of the environment and has called in Dutch experts Smit Salvage to manage recovery of the ship. Meanwhile, the captain \u2013 who according to court documents has admitted making a mistake and navigating by sight off the island\u2019s notoriously rocky shores \u2013 may be charged with manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship. Read court documents on the case against Francesco Schettino (trans. by La Repubblica) \u201cWhat happened is like a thunder clap in a bright sky. For the stupidity of one man, such a great disaster!\u201d Ortelli said. \u201cIn the future I hope they will not allow ships in the channel between us and the mainland.\u201d"

        "content": "Occupy London protesters who have been camped outside the landmark St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral for the past three months lost their court bid to avoid eviction Wednesday. The High Court ruled in favor of the City of London Corporation, the body that runs London\u2019s financial district, which applied for an eviction order after the protesters failed to abide by a previous order to pack up the camp. The Occupy London group will lodge an appeal against the ruling at the Court of Appeals on Thursday, their lawyer said. Barrister John Cooper said his clients had concerns about some of the evidence presented in court, which they said appeared to come from the cathedral rather than the City of London Corporation. He said the case was important because it was pushing the boundaries of the law as it relates to public protest.  The activists, who set up camp outside the cathedral October 15, have been protesting against corporate greed and economic inequality. Stuart Fraser, policy chairman for the City of London Corporation, said after the judgment that the action was taken to \u201cclear the tents and equipment at St Paul\u2019s.  \u201cWe hope the protesters will now remove the tents voluntarily. If not, and subject to any appeal proceedings, we will be considering enforcement action. \u201cLawful protests are a regular part of City life but tents, equipment and increasingly, quite a lot of mess and nuisance, is not what a highway is for and the public generally is losing out \u2013 as evidence before the court made clear,\u201d Fraser said. Many of the tents set up by the Occupy activists around St. Paul\u2019s are on what the corporation designates as a public road. St. Paul\u2019s suspended its own legal action against the activists in November, after a number of senior cathedral figures resigned over the threat to evict them."

        "content": "Romanian opposition leaders called for a series of protests beginning on Thursday to demand the resignation of government leaders and early elections. The opposition leaders met with Prime Minister Emil Boc on Wednesday to discuss the situation Romania is facing, following six days of citizen protests. \u201cEarly elections are the best solution we have to end the protests,\u201d opposition leader Crin Antonescu said. His coalition is asking for a new technocrat government to organize the balloting. Boc said the parliament will decide whether or not the early elections are the best solution for the country. The government and opposition leaders have agreed to hold a special parliamentary session next week. On Tuesday, thousands marched on the streets nationwide, asking for the resignation of President Traian Basescu and early elections. Many are angry over unemployment, which has forced Romanians to go abroad for jobs; others demonstrated against corruption or small state salaries. The leaders agreed Wednesday on the creation of an economic council of experts, representing the government and the opposition, to find new ways of creating jobs. A small number of people were arrested at the protests in Bucharest, the capital, officials said. Demonstrations took place nationwide under the supervision of thousands of police officers, officials said. No violent incidents were reported. The protests are the most serious since Basescu\u2019s election in 2004. Over the weekend, protesters blocked traffic in the capital, Bucharest, waving flags with the centers ripped out to symbolize the 1989 revolution. Others carried signs reading \u201cLiberty\u201d and \u201cDown with President Basescu.\u201d  Protests broke out last Thursday after Raed Arafat, a deputy health minister and opponent of health care changes proposed by the government, resigned. However, Arafat changed his mind on Tuesday, saying he had withdrawn his resignation. He added Basescu called him over the weekend to discuss the matter. Arafat gained popularity after creating what many Romanians see as an efficient medical emergency system. Boc invited trade unions and employers to meet Tuesday on the labor code, but the labor unions refused to participate. After meeting with employers, Boc said the government is focused on creating new jobs for Romanians and providing financial support to those wishing to start businesses. The protests also follow several unpopular measures taken by the government over the past two years.  After receiving a loan of 20 billion euros from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union in 2009, the government cut salaries in the public sector by 25% a year later to enforce austerity measures recommended by the IMF. The opposition Social Liberal Union has asked Romania\u2019s Constitutional Court to analyze the law merging local and parliamentary elections, which are set to take place in the fall. The law passed after the government received a vote of confidence in parliament in December. The court\u2019s answer was postponed until January 25.    "

        "content": "Thrust from obscurity to notoriety overnight, Capt. Francesco Schettino is the man at the center of the questions and recriminations over the Costa Concordia cruise ship disaster. As transcripts emerge of his conversations with the Italian coast guard on the fateful Friday night the ship ran aground, the 52-year-old\u2019s every word is being pored over for clues as to what happened. A picture is beginning to develop of a man who spent decades at sea, but who his employers say did not live up to his training or responsibilities at the helm of his ship. With at least 11 deaths confirmed and about two dozen people still missing, Schettino may face charges including manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning a ship when passengers were still on board, chief prosecutor Francesco Verusio has said. It also has been widely suggested Schettino may have been \u201cshowboating\u201d when he sailed the luxury cruise liner so close to the island of Giglio, where submerged rocks tore through the hull. Schettino, who has said he will cooperate with investigators, says the rocks were uncharted, and his lawyer says Schettino did everything he could to preserve the lives of crew and passengers. Read court documents on the case against Francesco Schettino (trans. by La Repubblica) A native of Castellamare di Stabbia, near the southern city of Naples, Schettino comes from a seafaring family, Italy\u2019s Corriere della Sera newspaper reports. He graduated from the well-regarded Nino Bixio nautical institute in Piano di Sorrento, in Naples province, 30 years ago, according to the news agency Adnkronos. He joined Costa in 2002 as a safety officer, served as a staff captain, and was appointed captain in 2006, according to the cruise line. Like all Costa masters, the cruise line said, Schettino \u201chas been constantly trained, passing all tests.\u201d Costa chairman Pier Luigi Foschi said Schettino had never been involved in an accident before. He also played down the possibility that alcohol may have played a role in the disaster, saying he did not believe Schettino drank, and that all crew were subject to random drug and alcohol tests by Costa Cruises.  But Foschi placed the blame for the wreck squarely on the captain, saying it was his choice to deviate from frequently traveled routes. Corriere della Sera reported that Schettino came close to Giglio to salute Mario Palombo, a legend among Costa Cruises\u2019 commanders, and as a gesture to the only Giglio native on board, chief steward Antonello Tievoli. Schettino, who according to the Virgilio newspaper was well thought of by fellow sailors in Naples, is  under house arrest at his family home in Meta di Sorrento, where some residents have come to his defense. Judge Valeria Montesarchio told a court in Grosseto, the provincial capital, that there was substantial evidence against Schettino and spoke of \u201cthe grave imprudence and inexperience\u201d that had marked his behavior. The court heard that Schettino was accused of abandoning about 300 people who were unable to look after themselves, and to whom he had a responsibility as captain, when he left the ship before they did. He made no serious attempt to get back on board the ship and was \u201ctotally incapable of managing\u201d the emergency, the judge said.  The judge said the captain admitted to to making a mistake and that, at the time of the collision, he was navigating by sight. But, ordering his house arrest, Montesarchio said he had shown no signs of trying to flee the scene after the accident and that there was no danger of him tampering with the evidence. There was also no risk of him committing the same offense again, Montesarchio said, saying Schettino had expressed \u201cintent to change his life\u201d and no longer work on ships. For the time being, Schettino is confined to his family home, and can only communicate with those he lives with, the judge ordered. It was to his mother, Rosa, that Schettino made a call at 5 a.m. Saturday, according to the Repubblica newspaper, telling her that \u201ca tragedy\u201d had occurred and that he had \u201ctried to save as many passengers as possible.\u201d  The captain reportedly told her \u201cnot to worry because it was all over.\u201d A rather different picture has emerged from the transcripts of conversations between Schettino and the Italian coast guard published by Corriere della Sera. In those, the captain gives conflicting accounts of what happened when the ship hit rocks just off Italy\u2019s western coast, leading to what passengers described as a chaotic and surreal scene as they rushed to evacuate. Schettino initially appears to play down the scale of the disaster, saying only that a \u201ctechnical failure\u201d has occurred. Schettino then tells an official he has abandoned the vessel, according to the transcripts, which prosecutors say match those used in their investigation. But as the official questions his decision, Schettino appears to reverse course and says he did not abandon ship but was \u201ccatapulted into the water\u201d after the ship ran into a rock, began taking on water and started listing. As the night unfolds, the coast guard commander repeatedly questions why Schettino, as captain, is not on the ship when passengers are still aboard. But Schettino appears unwilling either to go back on board or to take charge of the desperate evacuation efforts, the transcripts reveal. Prosecutors have ruled out technical error as a cause of the accident, saying Schettino was on the bridge at the time the ship ran aground and made a \u201cgrave error\u201d that led to the disaster. The Italian coast guard and Costa Cruises are still investigating why Schettino took the ship so close to shore in an area known for its rocky sea floor. Costa Cruises has said that \u201cpreliminary indications are that there may have been significant human error on the part of the ship\u2019s master, Capt. Francesco Schettino, which resulted in these grave consequences.\u201d  \u201cThe route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore, and the captain\u2019s judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard Costa procedures,\u201d the statement added. In addition to questions over how Schettino handled himself after the wreck, questions also lingered about whether the captain should have ordered an evacuation sooner and why no \u201cmayday\u201d distress signal was sent. The captain\u2019s attorney, Bruno Leporatti, said in a statement Monday that Schettino was \u201cshattered, dismayed, saddened for the loss of lives and strongly disturbed.\u201d But, he said, Schettino is \u201cnonetheless comforted by the fact that he maintained during those moments the necessary lucidity to put in place a difficult emergency maneuver \u2026 bringing the ship to shallow waters.\u201d That move, Leporatti said, saved the lives of many passengers and crew members. The eyes of the world will likely remain on Schettino as investigators come to their own conclusions about the role he played in a catastrophe some have likened to the sinking of the Titanic a century ago."

China\u2019s French Open titleholder will face Spanish 26th seed Anabel Medina Garrigues as she seeks to set up a fourth-round rematch with defending champion Kim Clijsters. The Belgian 11th seed had few problems in beating France\u2019s Stephanie Foretz Gacon 6-0 6-1 to earn a tie against Slovakian No. 20 Daniela Hantuchova. Li or Clijsters could potentially face Wozniacki in the last eight. Tenth seed Francesca Schiavone, the 2010 French Open champion, failed to match last year\u2019s quarterfinal effort in Melbourne as she crashed out against fellow Italian Romina Oprandi, losing 6-4 6-3. The 80th-ranked 25-year-old \u2013 who had never previously progressed past round two in a grand slam \u2013 will next face German 22nd seed Julia Gorges.  Chinese 16th seed Peng Shuai also exited, losing 6-2 6-4 to Czech Iveta Benesova \u2013 who earned a clash with Russian debutant Nina Bratchikova. Former world No. 1 Jelena Jankovic also won in straight sets to set up a meeting with American 19-year-old Christina McHale, with the Serbian 13th seed on course for a fourth-round clash with Wozniacki as she too continues her bid for a first grand slam title. Polish eighth seed Agnieszka Radwanska also progressed into a third-round tie against Kazakhstan\u2019s world No. 57 Galina Voskoboeva, who has matched her best performance at the tournament."

        "content": "As one of the world\u2019s most successful golfers, Ernie Els has got it all. The three-time major winner is famous for his sporting achievements, but he is giving a lot back to the game he loves and the country he cherishes. Not only is his golf foundation now in its 13th year, but Els also contributes to the economy of the Cape region where he grew up, investing in a wine and restaurant business plus an award-winning golf resort that he helped design. And \u2013 inspired by his son \u2013 he has raised millions of dollars for research into autism. The 42-year-old will not be short of local support at this week\u2019s Volvo Golf Champions tournament at Fancourt in George. The Ernie Els and Fancourt Foundation was established to help under-privileged kids take up a sport that is unaffordable to most in his native South Africa. \u201cHaving him back home means so much to us,\u201d says foundation member Kim Daniels. Her colleague Sylvia Masango says the experience and lessons learned from Els and the other coaches and mentors have transformed her life. \u201cGolf is who I am now. It has helped me to become the person I am,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t know where I would be now without golf.\u201d Family background Els\u2019 own sporting ambitions were supported every step of the way by his father Neels, who owned a transport business, and mother Hettie. Known as the \u201cBig Easy\u201d for his languid style, he won the U.S. Open at the age of just 24 in 1994 and has been among the game\u2019s elite ever since. \u201cI had golf clubs, golf shoes \u2013 all these things cost a lot of money. The equipment in golf is very expensive. There are a lot of kids in South Africa, and around the world, that have talent. I\u2019ve seen these kids not make it because of their inability to pay for good equipment,\u201d he told CNN.  \u201cSo they go by the wayside, I\u2019ve seen it happen. That\u2019s why we started the foundation, to get them to really hone their skills.\u201d  The foundation\u2019s star graduate is 2010 British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen, who spent three years on the program and now makes regular visits back to inspire its pupils.  \u201cThe gods were smiling on us to have a kid like Louis come to the foundation,\u201d said a proud Els.  \u201cI feel like that was something I wanted to do because I am so fond of South Africa, so fond of the country and the people. I just felt it was my duty to give something back to the less fortunate.\u201d Oosthuizen is grateful for his time with the foundation and the important lessons learned before bursting onto the golf scene. \u201cIt\u2019s very special to have spent three years on the foundation, and it\u2019s great what Ernie is doing for the kids,\u201d he told CNN.  Autism foundation If the foundation is dear to Els\u2019 heart, the fund-raising charity he has set up to tackle autism is a real labor of love. His son Ben was diagnosed with the condition when he was four, and Els set himself the goal of establishing a center of excellence for autism that would be at the cutting edge of research and educational therapy, \u201csomething the world has never seen before.\u201d Since going public with his son\u2019s problem in 2008, Els has campaigned on behalf of Autism Speaks and used his sporting connections to raise millions of dollars for his Els for Autism Foundation. His dream is coming ever nearer to reality. \u201cNext year I expect to raise $5 million and almost be ready for breaking ground on the new center,\u201d he told CNN. Els uprooted his family \u2013 wife Liezl, daughter Samantha and Ben \u2013 from their main home on Wentworth Golf Course in southern England to Florida to get better treatment for his son, who is \u201cquite severely affected\u201d by the condition. With his worldwide fame and influence, Els knows that he is in a position to make a real difference in tackling autism. \u201cI\u2019ve seen families where three kids have autism. Now that must be one of the hardest things in the world, because just to do your normal everyday stuff would be almost impossible if you don\u2019t have extra help,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe have the resources, we have the money to actually cope with it. There are people and families who don\u2019t have that, so we want to try to better their lives.\u201d Commercial interests Els spends the majority of his time based in Palm Beach, but every winter returns to South Africa to check personally on his private and commercial interests. They include a thriving golf course design business and the realization of a dream to build a signature layout in an area of the Cape where he used to hang out with friends and enjoy barbecues on the beach. Oubaai at Herold\u2019s Bay is now established, with the 18 holes taking in rugged surroundings near the Indian Ocean. It was voted \u201cBest Golf Resort in South Africa\u201d in a 2007 survey. Els has also designed courses on four continents, but his business empire does not end there. Having met his wife on a farm in Stellenbosch, which is famous for its vineyards, he developed a love of the grape and, at the turn of the century, set up Ernie Els Wines. He partnered expert Louis Strydom to develop a range of five red wines, and in 2011 added a white to the collection.  Visitors to the area do not have to go far to sample the products, which are on sale at the \u201cBig Easy Restaurant\u201d on South Africa\u2019s second-oldest road in Stellenbosch. Golfing ambitions With all these commitments, Els might be expected to slowly slide down the world rankings as he nears the latter stage of his career. But the former No. 1 is still desperate to add to his near 70 victories worldwide and to his majors tally. He failed to win on the U.S PGA Tour in 2011, meaning he missed the season-opening Tournament of Champions in Hawaii, but after playing in South Africa this week he will return to spend the bulk of his season in the United States. \u201cI want to really concentrate on America and get some wins early on and hopefully get some real confidence going ahead of the first major at Augusta,\u201d said Els, now ranked 71st. And how long can he continue to play at the top level?  \u201cWell. I don\u2019t want it to end now,\u201d he smiled. \u201cI\u2019m 42 and in pretty decent shape for a golfer. I want to continue to win tournaments, the desire still burns bright.\u201d  Els added: \u201cFifty has always been kind of the mark. At 50 you go onto the Seniors Tour and so forth. My good friend Vijay Singh is 48 this year, he\u2019s also had a bit of a quiet year, so I feel there\u2019s many years left in me.  \u201cThere have been guys in their 40s who have won major championships. Mark O\u2019Meara won two majors when he was 42, so there\u2019s a lot of hope for us.\u201d "

Loeb, from France, had been trailing rival Jari-Matti Latvala by 30 seconds going into the final stage of Wednesday\u2019s race but the Finn crashed and rolled his Ford, forcing him to retire. Dani Sordo, driving for Mini, took second despite damaging his suspension during the morning stage \u2013 known as a \u2018special.\u2019 The Spaniard is one minute and four seconds behind his French rival. Monte Carlo is the first stop on the world rally championship circuit, which features 13 separate races around the globe and runs until November. Loeb has won a record eight straight titles, all for Citroen, and he was quickest in three of the four specials. His Citroen team-mate Mikko Hirvonen collided with a wall and sustained damage to one of his brakes, while Ford\u2019s Petter Solberg decision to use his snow tires meant he ended the day in third place, a second behind Sordo. A total of seven former world champions are part of the field for the 2012 installment, while Monte Carlo was hosting the world rally championship for the first time in three years. There are six race stages on Thursday."

        "content": "Nearly five years to the day after a Turkish-Armenian newspaper editor was gunned down in broad daylight, a judge acquitted all 19 defendants in his trial of charges that they were members of an \u201carmed terrorist organization.\u201d One defendant, Yasin Hayal, received a life sentence for conspiring in the planned killing of Hrant Dink, editor-in-chief of the Armenian-language newspaper \u201cAgos.\u201d  Prosecutors accused Hayal of purchasing the murder weapon, a 7.65 millimeter Turkish-produced handgun.  Hayal was also accused of recruiting a 17-year old soccer player named Ogun Samast to use the gun to kill Dink. Another defendant, Erhan Tuncel, was cleared of charges in connection to the murder.  Instead, he was sentenced to more than 10 years in prison for the 2004 bombing of a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in the Black Sea city of Trabzon. Attorneys for the Dink family denounced the sentences, arguing it downgraded a politically motivated assassination to the level of a common criminal murder. \u201cThis decision was unexpected,\u201d lawyer Fethiye Cetin told journalists outside the courthouse. Standing next to Dink\u2019s widow, Rakel, Cetin called the trial a \u201ccomedy.\u201d \u201cThe tradition of the state of political murders and the tradition of the state to make enemies of some of its citizens by classifying them as \u2018others,\u2019 this tradition continues,\u201d Cetin continued. \u201cThis was was an opportunity for democratization in Turkey, but they did not seize that opportunity.\u201d Dink was gunned down on the sidewalk outside the Istanbul office of the Agos newspaper in 2007. Surveillance cameras caught the convicted murderer, Samast, fleeing the scene wearing a white hat.  The confessed killer was later sentenced to more than 22 years in prison.  He received a lighter sentence because he was a minor. At the time of the murder, Dink was defending himself in court against a number of cases accusing him of \u201cinsulting Turkish identity,\u201d for comments made about the massacre of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Armenians in the final days of the Ottoman Empire.  Dink argued the killings amounted to genocide, a term the Turkish state continues to vehemently deny. In 2010, the European Court of Human rights fined Turkey more than $100,000 for failing to \u201cprotect the life and freedom of expression\u201d of Dink. In interviews before his murder, Dink said he had received death threats for his outspoken opinions.  Investigative journalist Nedim Sener later wrote in a book that Istanbul police were aware of threats to Dink\u2019s life. Sener is currently in prison, facing charges of plotting to overthrow the Turkish government. \u201cThe Turkish authorities have failed to address state officials\u2019 alleged involvement in the killing of journalist and human rights activist Hrant Dink,\u201d Amnesty International wrote this week.  \u201cThe security services knew of the murder plot and were in communication with those accused of the murder yet nothing was done to stop it taking place\u2026 Nothing short of a full investigation into the actions of all the state institutions and officials implicated in the murder will represent justice.\u201d After Tuesday\u2019s court ruling, Dink\u2019s family and attorneys, along with several hundred supporters, marched in protest through the streets of Istanbul in sub-zero temperatures carrying signs saying \u201cWe are all Armenian.\u201d "

        "content": "Bruno Senna has signed for Formula One constructor Williams 18 years after his uncle, former three-time world champion Ayrton, died driving for the team. The Brazilian will partner Pastor Maldonado when the 2012 F1 season gets underway in Australia on March 18, replacing veteran compatriot Rubens Barrichello. Bruno\u2019s uncle Ayrton is one of the greatest drivers the sport has seen, winning drivers\u2019 championship crowns in 1988, 1990 and 1991 before he died in a crash at the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994. It was only his third race for Williams. Williams\u2019 cars have carried his name ever since the tragedy at the Imola racing circuit, and Bruno, who made his debut for HRT in 2010, says he is excited to follow in his uncle\u2019s footsteps. Ferrari\u2019s Alonso slams F1 testing rules  \u201cIt will be very interesting to drive for a team that my uncle has driven for, particularly as quite a few of the people here actually worked with Ayrton,\u201d the 28-year-old told Williams\u2019 website. \u201cHopefully we can bring back some memories and create some great new ones too. I also want to get some good results in return for the support my country has given me to help get me to this position today.  \u201cI am very proud to be Brazilian and more motivated than ever to demonstrate what I can do. Ever since I first sat in a go-kart I never wanted to do anything else.\u201d Team principal Frank Williams, who was in charge of Williams when Ayrton Senna died, said he was looking forward to seeing Bruno compete at the highest level. The driver struggled with HRT in the team\u2019s debut season, then moved to Renault as a reserve driver before replacing Nick Heidfeld for the final eight races of 2011, but scored points in just one of his eight races as he finished ninth at the Italian Grand Prix. \u201cThe circumstances of Bruno\u2019s two seasons in Formula One have not given him an ideal opportunity to deliver consistently so it was essential that we spent as much time with him as possible to understand and evaluate him as a driver,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe have done this both on track and in our simulator and he has proven quick, technically insightful and above all capable of learning and applying his learning quickly and consistently. Now we are looking forward to seeing that talent in our race car.\u201d Senna\u2019s deal with Williams could spell the end of Barrichello\u2019s Formula One career as the 39-year-old is now without a team with the new season two months away. He said on his official Twitter account: \u201cI won\u2019t be driving the Williams car this year. I wish my friend @BSenna all the best..the future is wide open.\u201d HRT is the only team with a seat available, having yet to confirm a race partner for Pedro de la Rosa."

        "content": "A Hungarian was among at least 11 people who died after the cruise ship Costa Concordia ran aground and rolled on its side last week off a Tuscan island, officials said Wednesday. The mayor\u2019s office in Grosseto, the provincial capital, identified the victim as Sandor Feher, a member of the crew.  His body was one of five recovered Tuesday. The office said 26 people remained missing. But the list may include some of the five victims. Rescue crews suspended operations Wednesday as the ship began to move, the Italian coast guard said. The search for survivors has been halted and restarted several times.  The family of two missing Americans, Gerald and Barbara Heil of White Bear Lake, Minnesota, said it was thankful for perilous attempts to find those still unaccounted for. \u201cWhile it is certainly hard for us to see the recovery efforts stall due to the unstable conditions \u2026 we are also very concerned for the safety of the Italian coast guard as they continue to put forth a heroic effort in trying to find those who remain missing,\u201d relatives wrote. Experts say chances of finding survivors are slim. \u201cI think you have to look at several issues. One is just the hypothermia. If a compartment is flooded, even if there was air, at this point, most of them would have succumbed to the hypothermic problem of the water temperature,\u201d said Butch Hendrick, president of the diving safety company Lifeguard Systems.  Costa Serena, sister ship of the Concordia, sailed by the wreckage Wednesday night, safely navigating the waters around the island of Giglio. Read more about the island that bears witness to tragedy The investigation is focusing on actions by Concordia Capt. Francesco Schettino. Prosecutor Francesco Verusio has accused the captain of piloting the ship too fast to allow him to react to dangers, causing the shipwreck, according to legal papers. Judge Valeria Montesarchio\u2019s initial ruling found Schettino changed the ship\u2019s course, steering too close to shore and causing the ship to hit a rock. The judge said the captain admitted to making a mistake and that, at the time of the collision, he was navigating by sight. Schettino may face charges including manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning a ship when passengers were still on board, prosecutors said. Read court documents on the case against Francesco Schettino (trans. by La Repubblica) In her preliminary investigation, Montesarchio said there appears to be considerable evidence against the captain, whom she said showed \u201cimprudence and inexperience.\u201d The judge\u2019s findings included: Schettino made no serious attempt to return to the ship, he underestimated the damage to the Concordia and he failed to alert authorities in a timely manner.  \u201cThe captain could not but realize right away the gravity of the situation both because of the tilt and because he was alerted by the crew of the water influx,\u201d Montesarchio said.  The captain abandoned ship while at least 100 people were still on board, the judge said. Montesarchio described the shipwreck as \u201ca disaster of global proportion.\u201d Royal Caribbean International Capt. William Wright, speaking on behalf of Cruise Lines International Association, an industry group, said crews must use available technologies, including radar and GPS systems, and compare readings to nautical charts. Looking out the bridge window is an aid to navigation, Wright said, but \u201cthat should absolutely by no means be your primary sense of position referencing.\u201d The shipping industry newspaper Lloyd\u2019s List reported that Friday was not the first time the Costa Concordia steamed extremely close to shore near Giglio. Satellite tracking data obtained by the paper show that the ship passed within 230 meters (755 feet) of the coast of the island at least once before, even closer than the location where the Costa Concordia hit the rocks lasted weekend. The pass happened on August 14, 2011, Lloyd\u2019s List reported.  \u201cIt must have come within sniffing distance of the underwater rock that it hit on this voyage,\u201d editor-in-chief Adam Smallman of Lloyd\u2019s List told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night. Costa Cruises chairman Pier Luigi Foschi earlier this week said a pass near the island last summer occurred only once, on August 9-10, 2011. The discrepancy in the dates could not be reconciled late Wednesday. The pass occurred \u201cunder the authorization of the maritime authority, local maritime authority with the authority of the island aware, and with the permission of Costa, after having reviewed the route that the captain intended to take nearby the island,\u201d Foschi said, adding the vessel was observing San Lorenzo, known as night of the shooting stars. The executive said the pass was not to be within 500 meters of the island. Foschi on Monday placed the blame for the wreck squarely on the captain, saying it was his choice to deviate from frequently traveled routes. \u201cWe believe it has been a human error here,\u201d Foschi said. \u201cThe captain did not follow the authorized route, which is used by Costa ships very frequently. There\u2019s probably more than 100 times in one year we have this route.\u201d  Schettino was arrested after leaving the ship while dozens were still aboard, panicked and fighting for lifeboats.  In transcripts of conversations between Schettino and the Italian coast guard, published by the Italian daily newspaper Corriere della Sera, the captain gives conflicting accounts of what happened when the ship hit the rocks Friday night. At first, Schettino tells an official he had abandoned the vessel, according to the transcripts, which prosecutors say match those used in their investigation. But as the official questions his decision, Schettino appears to reverse himself and say he had not abandoned ship but was \u201ccatapulted into the water\u201d after the ship ran into a rock, began taking on water and started listing.  In a later conversation, an Italian coast guard official demands Schettino return to his ship, the transcripts show. \u201cYou get on board! This is an order!\u201d Capt. Gregorio De Falco instructed Schettino. \u201cYou have declared \u2018Abandon ship.\u2019 Now I\u2019m in charge. You get on board \u2013 is that clear?\u201d the port official said.  De Falco\u2019s tough tone has been celebrated across Italy, with even a T-shirt on sale featuring another line he uttered to Schettino: \u201cGet on board, damn it.\u201d A Facebook page praising De Falco\u2019s comments had nearly 17,000 \u201clikes\u201d Wednesday. There were roughly 4,200 people on the Costa Concordia when it ran aground \u2013 about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members, the vast majority of whom made it off the ship safely. Italian prosecutors have ruled out a technical error as the cause of the incident, saying the captain was on the bridge at the time and had made a \u201cgrave error.\u201d But they are examining whether others may share responsibility for the crash with the captain. Schettino was transferred to house arrest, his lawyer, Bruno Leporatti, said. Montesarchio justified the move on the grounds that the captain is not a flight risk and there is no danger of his interfering with evidence or committing the crime again. The captain was under house arrest in Meta di Sorrento. In London, where he was meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti said he did not want to get ahead of the \u201cmultiple and meticulous inquiries\u201d under way, but \u201cobviously, any such disaster could and should be avoided.\u201d  He added that Italian authorities are also working to avoid any environmental damage as the result of the shipwreck. The company said  it has hired a salvage company to recover the remaining fuel from the ship, with work beginning by the end of the week.  Kevin Rebello, whose brother Russel was a member of the crew, refused to give up hope. His brother was last seen helping passengers into lifeboats Friday night. \u201cMiracles do happen, and let\u2019s keep hope. I\u2019m not here to lose hope,\u201d Kevin Rebello said. "

        "content": "Romania\u2019s deputy health minister, whose resignation last week triggered ongoing protests across the nation, was reappointed to his post on Tuesday after meeting with the prime minister. Raed Arafat said Tuesday he had withdrawn his resignation, adding that President Traian Basescu called him over the weekend to discuss the matter. Protests broke out last Thursday after Arafat, an opponent of health care changes proposed by the government, resigned. Arafat gained popularity after creating what many Romanians see as an efficient medical emergency system. Facing public pressure, Basescu decided to scrap the changes Friday, saying he made the decision after realizing that a majority of those in the medical system opposed the measure. Critics had argued that the proposal favored the private health care system by allowing it access to government funds while the state-funded system lacks financial aid. Arafat said Tuesday he withdrew his resignation because the changes were scrapped. He said he will now focus on creating a new health care bill that does not compromise the nation\u2019s health care system, especially the emergency system. Protests, however, continued on Monday, as thousands took to the streets nationwide to demonstrate against government austerity measures, calling for Basescu\u2019s resignation and early elections.  However, officials said there was no violence on Monday. Protests took place under the supervision of thousands of police, and there were arrests for disturbing the peace and criminal acts, officials said. On Sunday, authorities used tear gas on demonstrators. The demonstrations are the most serious since Basescu\u2019s election in 2004. Banks, shops and bus stations in the capital have been  vandalized, said Bucharest Mayor Sorin Oprescu. The protesters blocked traffic over the weekend, waving flags with the centers ripped out to symbolize the 1989 revolution. Others carried signs reading \u201cLiberty\u201d and \u201cDown with President Basescu.\u201d A special parliamentary session is expected this week on the events. Opposition leaders said Monday a new series of protests is planned. The group disagrees with the government\u2019s response to the citizen demonstrations, said Crin Antonescu, liberal opposition leader. \u201cThe National Liberal Party asks the prime minister and his cabinet to resign immediately because they couldn\u2019t manage the violent protests held over the last couple of days in Bucharest,\u201d Antonescu said Monday. Government officials have called on opposition leaders to meet with them  in the next few days.  The protests also follow several unpopular measures taken by the government over the past two years. After receiving a loan of 20 billion euros from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union in 2009, the government cut salaries in the public sector by 25% a year later to enforce austerity measures recommended by the IMF. Prime Minister Emil Boc invited trade unions and employers to meet Tuesday on the labor code, but the labor unions refused to participate. After meeting with employers, Boc said the government is focused on creating new jobs for Romanians and providing financial support to those wishing to start businesses. "

        "content": "Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer remained on course for a semifinal showdown at the Australian Open with untroubled passage to the third round on Wednesday, but top American hope Mardy Fish became the first high-profile casualty of the men\u2019s draw. Second seed Nadal won in straight sets for the second match in a row, beating former world No. 2 Tommy Haas, while Federer had a walkover against another German, Andreas Beck. Nadal showed no signs of the recurring knee problem that troubled him before Monday\u2019s opening win as he triumphed 6-4 6-3 6-4 against the oldest player in the singles draw. The 33-year-old Haas has reached the semifinals three times in Melbourne, but has fallen to 190th in the rankings after a series of injury problems. \u201cI really practiced well,\u201d said Nadal, who next faces Slovakia\u2019s world No. 119 Lukas Lacko \u2013 a four-set conqueror of American Donald Young.   \u201cI had very good preparation. I won already two matches in straight sets with positive feeling. I am well.\u201d Federer, seeking his fifth title in the season\u2019s opening grand slam and his 17th overall, will face big-serving Croatian Ivo Karlovic in the last 32 following Beck\u2019s pre-match withdrawal with a back injury. The Swiss third seed, whose last major title came in Australia in 2010, had been due to play away from the main Rod Laver Arena court for the first time in 52 matches. But he said he was pleased that women players were getting more of a chance to play in marquee night matches this year, which means fewer late finishes for the men. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good that they always had the women\u2019s match first. I think it\u2019s good to mix it up,\u201d the 30-year-old said. Eighth seed Fish was less happy to play in the scorching afternoon heat, complaining about the timeouts that Colombian opponent Alejandro Falla took for treating cramps before sealing a 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 7-6 (8-6) victory. \u201cI thought he was having some physical issues. But then in between, on every point, he was totally fine,\u201d Fish said. \u201cI have a hard time calling the trainer for anything. I wouldn\u2019t want the other guy to know that I was hurting in the first place. To be able to get help for lack of fitness \u2026 I mean, if you  saw how much water I drank in the past three days just to hydrate to make sure that something like that didn\u2019t happen \u2013 I did all the right things there.\u201d Falla, ranked 71st, will next play Germany\u2019s Philipp Kohlschreiber, with the winner of that match likely to take on Argentine 11th seed Juan Martin del Potro. The 2009 U.S. Open champion set up a third-round clash with Taiwan\u2019s world No. 79 Yen-Hsun Lu by beating Slovenia\u2019s Blaz Kavcic 6-4 7-5 6-3, continuing his career revival following longterm wrist injury. Czech seventh seed Tomas Berdych went through after beating Belgium\u2019s Olivier Rochus in straight sets, and will next play big-serving South African No. 30 Kevin Anderson. American 16th seed John Isner survived another marathon match as he defeated 2006 semifinalist David Nalbandian 4-6 6-3 2-6 7-6 (7-5) 10-8. The match lasted more than four and a half hours, and the deciding set went for 99 minutes \u2013 with Nalbandian furious that he was denied a video challenge at 8-8 when he held a break-point on Isner\u2019s serve. \u201cObviously the ump didn\u2019t think he challenged in time, but maybe because of the crowd noise the ump couldn\u2019t hear it or what not,\u201d Isner said. \u201cThe break went in my favour, for sure.\u201d Isner, who was involved in the longest match in tennis history at Wimbledon in 2010, won the game and then broke the Argentine\u2019s serve in the next to set up a clash with Spanish 18th seed Feliciano Lopez. His fellow American Sam Querrey lost to Australia\u2019s 19-year-old rising star Bernard Tomic, who will next face Ukrainian 13th seed Alexandr Dolgopolov. Spanish 10th seed Nicolas Almagro came from 2-1 down to beat Bulgaria\u2019s Grigor Dimitrov in five sets to book a tie with Swiss 21st seed Stanislas Wawrinka, who beat 2006 finalist Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus, 7-6 6-4 5-7 6-1."

        "content": "Sixth seed and home favorite Samantha Stosur became the first high-profile casualty at the Australian Open on Tuesday, but five-time champion Serena Williams eased to victory on her return from injury. Hopes were high that world No. 5 Stosur could become the first Australian woman to win the Melbourne grand slam in 31 years, but she crashed out at the first hurdle after a 7-6 (7-2) 6-3 defeat to 59th-ranked Romanian Sorana Cirstea. Stosur claimed her first major title at September\u2019s U.S. Open, but won just one match in her two warm-up events this year as she admitted to struggling under the weight of expectation. Her poor form continued as she hit 33 unforced errors against a 21-year-old opponent who lost in the second round in 2010 and 2011. \u201cObviously I\u2019m extremely disappointed. There\u2019s not any other word for it but total disappointment,\u201d the 27-year-old said. Who will be the 2012 Australian Open victors \u201cSorana hung in there and kept going for it and eventually got better and better. I think she played a very, very good match. You have to give credit where credit\u2019s due. But I think maybe I didn\u2019t step up.\u201d Stosur is the fourth consecutive grand slam champion to be eliminated inside the first two rounds of the following major, with Kim Clijsters, Li Na and Petra Kvitova suffering similar fates at the French Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open respectively. Of that quartet, all but Clijsters had won their maiden slam. Cirstea, who has only once reached the quarterfinals of a major, will next play Poland\u2019s 99th-ranked Urszula Radwanska \u2013 who won 6-4 1-6 6-2 against American Alison Riske. Williams, seeking a 14th grand slam title, had no such problems despite having to wait until after midnight local time to seal her 6-4 6-2 win over Austria\u2019s 45th-ranked Tamira Paszek. \u201cI\u2019m definitely a night owl, I can stay up all night,\u201d the 12th seed said after her first match since suffering an ankle injury in the Brisbane Invitational. \u201cI really don\u2019t like mornings, but I don\u2019t mind them \u2013 during a tournament only, though.\u201d The American\u2019s five wins in Melbourne is a record for a woman in the Open era, although she hasn\u2019t played there since lifting the title back in 2010. \u201cThank you guys, I really appreciate you guys staying,\u201d Williams told the crowd who had stayed until the early hours of Wednesday morning. \u201cI haven\u2019t been here in over a year so I was a little nervous today, so thank you for getting me through it.\u201d Williams will play Czech world No. 49 Barbora Zahlavova Strycova in the second round following the 25-year-old\u2019s 6-0 6-4 success against France\u2019s Iryna Bremond. Second seed Kvitova\u2019s 6-2 6-0 triumph over Russia\u2019s world No. 82 Vera Dushevina was similarly comprehensive, with the Wimbledon champion wrapping up victory in 61 minutes. The 21-year-old Czech, who can usurp Caroline Wozniacki at the top of the world rankings in the next fortnight, faces Spain\u2019s Carla Suarez Navarro in round two. Fourth seed Maria Sharapova was also in a hurry, beating 68th-ranked Argentine Gisela Dulko 6-0 6-1 in just 58 minutes. The 2008 champion, a three-time grand slam winner, will face 144th-ranked American Jamie Hampton in the second round. Russian seventh seed Vera Zvonareva battled past Romanian world No. 61 Alexandra Dulgheru, as last year\u2019s semifinalist won 7-6 (7-4) 6-7 (5-7) 6-3 to set up a clash with 51st-ranked Czech Lucie Hradecka. Ninth seed Marion Bartoli beat fellow Frenchwoman Virginie Razzano 7-5 6-0 and will next face Australia\u2019s former world No. 4 Jelena Dokic, who won 6-2 6-1 against 196th-ranked Russian Anna Chakvetadze \u2013 a quarterfinalist in 2007 on her way to a career-high No. 5. German 14th seed Sabine Lisicki will play Israeli Shahar Peer in round two after a hard-fought 6-2 4-6 6-4 win over Switzerland\u2019s Stefaine Vogele. The 34th-ranked Peer disappointed the home crowd by thrashing Australian world No. 181 Isabella Holland 6-2 6-0. Former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic, the 23rd seed, had a comfortable 6-0 6-3 defeat of Spain\u2019s Lourdes Dominguez Lino. Serbia\u2019s 2008 French Open champion will next play Dutch world No. 91 Michaella Krajicek. Russian seeds Svetlana Kuznetsova, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Maria Kirilenko also went through, with the latter to face Canada\u2019s Aleksandra Wozniak after eliminating Australia\u2019s Jarmila Gajdosova. Slovakian 17th seed Dominika Cibulkova earned a clash with Hungarian world No. 92 Greta Arn, while Italian No. 23 Roberta Vinci will come up against China\u2019s unseeded Jie Zheng and 27th-ranked Estonian Kaia Kanepi faces Russia\u2019s Ekaterina Makarova."

        "content": "The British royal family has a long history with the sea. Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s much beloved Royal Yacht Britannia carried members of the monarchy on almost 1000 official voyages over 44 years, from her launch in 1953 to her decommissioning in 1997. Her Majesty was seen wiping a tear away at the farewell ceremony for Britannia, which was launched in 1953 with a dual purpose - to provide royal travel around the Commonwealth and to act as a hospital ship in time of war.  Now UK media reports that Conservative member of parliament Michael Gove has suggested the Queen should be given a new yacht to mark this year\u2019s diamond jubilee. What would go into designing a yacht fit for the Queen of England? We ask some yacht designers what they would do if they received the commission of a lifetime. A \u201ctimeless\u201d creation \u201cAny royal yacht is around for some time,\u201d says Ken Freviokh. \u201cIt needs to be timeless and look as good in ten years time as it did on its launch.\u201d The yacht designer would draw on the last Britannia as a source of inspiration for a new royal yacht. He says a highlight of the vessel is its \u201cbeautiful\u201d proportions which he would replicate for his own creation.  \u201cIt should embody the elegance of the old Britannia, but equally it could be a little bit daring,\u201d adds Freviokh. But while taking inspiration from the 125 meter yacht, the designer insists it should not be a copy.   \u201cA new royal yacht shouldn\u2019t be conventional,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it shouldn\u2019t have any \u2018trendy\u2019 solutions, it needs to be quite distinguished.\u201d Flexibility is essential for a head of state\u2019s yacht according to Freviokh. From official tours of the Commonwealth to honeymoons, the last Britannia was used for a range of activities. Freviokh would design large spaces that can be opened up when entertaining, and closed in with glass when the weather commands.  \u201cIt has to be a little bit of a transformer,\u201d he continues. \u201cThe area needs to be used all year around in all temperatures, from the warm Mediterranean to the cooler northern waters near Scotland.\u201d  Royal superyachts: How kings and queens sail the sea It\u2019s not all business for the royals, and Freviokh says he\u2019d take into account the more intimate occasions when creating spaces, allowing a banquet room to be converted into smaller family areas. \u201cPeople should melt\u201d Tony Castro wants onlookers to be captivated by any royal yacht he would design. \u201cPeople should melt when they see it,\u201d the designer says. \u201cIt should immediately send out a message.\u201d Castro would take into consideration the role a royal vessel plays when designing one. He says the boat is a great tool to promote the country and grab people\u2019s attention, whether they are heads of state, captains of industry or fundraisers. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to get people together to sell a message \u2013 no one could turn down an invitation to the royal yacht.\u201d Castro says the yacht must display the best of local talent \u2013 technically perfect so it can \u201cshow off Britain\u2019s capabilities\u201d and modern.  But Castro says any futuristic design should not include \u201cwacky\u201d features. \u201cIt can\u2019t be too much about the fashion.\u201d The cost-savvy approach In times of austerity, questions would be raised over the cost of any new royal yacht at the expense of the taxpayers. With that in mind Stephen Huish believes he has the solution for any penny-pinching royal \u2013 buy second-hand. HMS Victory: World\u2019s oldest warship to get $25m facelift  \u201cIn the current market, it\u2019s so much cheaper to buy an existing yacht and re-fit and condition it,\u201d says Huish. He thinks a complete interior overhaul and a good paint job would suffice. But Huish insists that does not mean that style would be compromised. \u201cExtravagant areas could be done with more lavish woods,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe outside should be modern but I don\u2019t think the royal family would go for a highly modern interior, it would have to be traditional,\u201d says the designer who thinks furnishing should be classic with a slight modern twist such as simple mouldings made out of wood. Huish also highlights the need for flexibility. \u201cI would have large VIP guest cabins where bulkheads could be cut off so it could be broken off into two or three rooms if need be.\u201d But if the Queen did not want a pre-loved model, Huish believes there\u2019s never been a better time to commission a yacht with an industry facing tough economic challenges; the royal is more likely to get more for her pound.

        "content": "Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry condemned Texas Gov. Rick Perry Tuesday for saying that Turkey was a \u201ccountry that is being ruled by what many would perceive to be Islamic terrorists.\u201d Perry made the statement during a spirited debated between Republican presidential candidates in South Carolina Monday night. Most of Turkey was fast asleep during the live broadcast, and Turkish newspapers had already gone to print by the time Perry declared that Turkey had moved \u201cfar away from the country I lived in back in the 1970s United States Air Force.  That was our ally that worked with us, but today we don\u2019t see that.\u201d The Texas governor also argued that it was time for Washington to cut foreign aid to Ankara. A spokesman for Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry fired back Tuesday, accusing Perry of making \u201cbaseless and improper claims.\u201d In a statement e-mailed to CNN, Selcuk Unal said presidential candidates should \u201cbe more informed about the world and be more careful their statements.\u201d \u201cThe unfortunate views of Perry are not shared in any case by Republican party supporters, considering the weak support he has received in public polls and primary elections,\u201d Unal concluded. U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the State Department \u201cabsolutely and fundamentally\u201d disagrees with Perry\u2019s statements.  Turkey is \u201cIslamic democracy in action,\u201d Toner added, calling Ankara a \u201cstalwart ally\u201d with which the United States has a \u201cstrong partnership.\u201d \u201cI am disappointed and concerned that Turkey and its time-tested ties of alliance, partnership and friendship with the United States became the object of misplaced and ill-advised criticism during last night\u2019s Republican candidates\u2019 debate. Needless to say, the Turkey described in the debate simply does not exist,\u201d Turkey\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Namik Tan, said in a statement Tuesday. He also rejected the idea that Turkey receives significant sums of foreign aid from the United States. \u201cIndeed, Turkey is a strong and growing trading partner with the U.S. in general, and with Texas in particular, creating thousands of jobs throughout that state,\u201d Tan added. Top Turkish government officials were unavailable for comment Tuesday, with many of them in Northern Cyprus for the funeral of veteran Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas, but the country\u2019s largely-tabloid press wasted no time in responding to the comments on websites early Tuesday morning. \u201cThe debate that the Republican candidate Rick Perry attended on American Fox TV turned into a scandal that contained very ugly statements about Turkey,\u201d announced TRT state television. \u201cRick Perry: what an idiot,\u201d tweeted Mustafa Akyol, a columnist with the English-language Hurriyet Daily news.  The Hurriyet newspaper also posted a video on its website of Perry drawing a blank in the middle of a prior debate, forgetting in mid-sentence which was the third of three government departments he would cut if elected president. Perry\u2019s remarks came on the same day a Turkish foreign ministry spokesman announced that a new NATO radar station, manned by Turkish and American military personnel, went online this month in the Turkish province of Malatya.  The radar station is part of a controversial U.S.-led missile defense shield that both Russia and Iran have publicly opposed. For more than 50 years, Turkey has been the only Muslim member of the NATO military alliance. Ankara\u2019s relationship with Washington has been turbulent over the last decade, with sharp divisions emerging after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. But that relationship has improved dramatically over the last several years.  Turkey has commanded the NATO mission in Afghanistan four times over the last decade, and the United States shares real-time intelligence from aerial drones for the Turkish military\u2019s ongoing war with rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party, who operate along the mountainous border between Turkey and Iraq.

        "content": "Spain\u2019s best-known judge, Baltasar Garzon, went on trial Tuesday in Madrid accused of abusing his judicial authority in an investigation into financial corruption.       The trial before a seven-judge panel at Spain\u2019s Supreme Court began Tuesday morning and if convicted, Garzon, who was suspended in 2010 pending the trial,  would not go to jail but could lose his right permanently to be a judge in Spain.        The trial in the so-called Gurtel financial and political corruption case is just the first of two trials against Garzon. Next week, a case that many legal experts say is the more important one, accuses Garzon again of overstepping his legal authority while investigating human rights abuses under the former dictatorship of Spain\u2019s Francisco Franco. Garzon became known internationally in 1998 when he sought the extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, who was in a London hospital. Garzon accused him of the murder of Spaniards in Chile and of crimes of genocide. Garzon said in May 2010, at the time of suspension from his post as investigating magistrate at the National Court, \u201cI face this calmly, with the tranquility of knowing that I am innocent of these charges.\u201d In both trials, Spanish prosecutors have asked that all charges be dropped against Garzon. But, under Spanish law, a private prosecution is also allowed and it is the lawyers for these parties that are pressing the charges against Garzon, judicial authorities and Garzon\u2019s lawyers said. In the financial corruption case that Garzon was investigating, and which still has ongoing trials against defendants in various parts of Spain, Garzon ordered wiretaps against some defendants being held in jail, and some of their conversations were with their lawyers. These lawyers later filed charges against Garzon, saying he had overstepped his judicial authority in ordering the wiretaps and also violated their constitutional rights. Garzon later said that if he planned to investigate the defense lawyers themselves, he would have done so, but that the wiretaps were due to suspicions that the defendants in the corruption scandal were moving funds even while they were in preventative prison. The trial is expected to open with preliminary questions, and if there are no major delays, Garzon might testify on Tuesday. It is due to last three days, a Supreme Court spokesman said Tuesday. The case next week involves alleged abuse of judicial power against Garzon while investigating mass graves under the Franco regime, some of which are still being dug up in Spain. A small civil servants union called Manos Limpias, or Clean Hands, brought charges against Garzon in the Franco case, saying the he ignored a 1977 amnesty law approved by Spanish parliament, two years after Franco\u2019s death. \u201cParliament unanimously approved the amnesty law. Judge Baltasar Garzon takes a stance as if they\u2019re crazy. What does he think? That he\u2019s better than them,\u201d said Miguel Bernard, leader of Manos Limpias. Bernard denies critics\u2019 charges that his group is a tiny far-right front, but he told CNN he was proud to receive an honor just last month from the Francisco Franco Foundation.       Outside the ornate 18th century Supreme Court building, a demonstration in favor of Garzon occurred Tuesday at the door where court officials entered.  Human rights groups have been closely following the cases against Garzon. \u201cIt is very ironic that Garzon, who has become a symbol internationally of justice, should be prosecuted at home for the very things that he became a hero for around the world and in Latin America in particular,\u201d Reed Brody, of Human Rights Watch, told CNN recently. Garzon, 56, spent 22 years as an investigating magistrate at the National Court, which handles cases of terrorism and other delicate cases. He has investigated the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, the Basque terrorist group ETA, and drug traffickers. At times in the past, Garzon has been considered a darling of the Spanish right or the Spanish left, depending on the cases he was investigating. His critics say he is too flamboyant, always too willing to speak in front of the cameras.  Since his suspension in 2010, Garzon has been working as a legal adviser outside of Spain on human rights cases and judicial issues, including in Latin America. A third case against Garzon, for alleged improprieties in organizing some courses at New York University that had major Spanish corporations as sponsors, is still in the investigation phase and not trial date has been set.  In that case as well, Spanish prosecutors have not pressed charges but private prosecution has.   "

        "content": "World No. 1 Novak Djokovic made a strong start to the defense of his Australian Open crown on Tuesday, and then backed growing calls for change in the men\u2019s tennis calendar. The top seed powered past 109th-ranked Italian Paolo Lorenzi 6-2 6-0 6-0 in round one before echoing rival Rafael Nadal\u2019s sentiments that the busy ATP Tour schedule is having a negative impact. \u201cI don\u2019t think that whatever I will say will be something new, something that we don\u2019t know,\u201d the 24-year-old Serbian told reporters.  \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that there is a lot of players in men\u2019s tennis that are complaining about the schedule and season. They don\u2019t even need to say much.   Federer shrugs off Nadal criticism \u201cBut just looking in the injuries that we have, especially from the top players, including myself, I felt that towards the end of last year, it\u2019s obvious that we need some change. But I prefer talking in detail about these things more behind closed doors.\u201d Djokovic, playing in his first ATP Tour match this year, suffered an early setback as Lorenzi broke his serve in the third game to lead 2-1. But the four-time grand slam winner recovered, winning 16 games in a row to wrap up victory in the scorching heat of the Rod Laver Arena in one hour and 32 minutes. \u201cObviously, I want to get a good start of the year in my first official match of the season,\u201d Djokovic said.  \u201cI\u2019m satisfied with the overall performance today. I think it was really the hottest day since I\u2019ve arrived here.  \u201cI just have more confidence that I\u2019m playing on right now. I just believe that I can win, especially against the biggest rivals in the major events.\u201d Djokovic will next play Colombia\u2019s 56th-ranked Santiago Giraldo, who beat Italy\u2019s Matteo Viola 6-4 6-2 6-1. His opponent in last year\u2019s final, Andy Murray, was made to work hard for his place in the second round.  The British fourth seed came from behind to defeat American teenager Ryan Harrison 4-6 6-3 6-4 6-2 in three hours and 12 minutes at the Hisense Arena. \u201cHe came out playing great tennis, going for his shots and hitting big,\u201d Murray, who was also runner-up in 2010, said of the 77th-ranked 19-year-old. \u201cThis court is tough \u2013 there\u2019s very little shade. \u201cWe had a few long rallies and he made me do a lot of running. I\u2019ll need to make sure in my next match that I play closer to the baseline.\u201d Murray will next play France\u2019s world No. 101 Edouard Roger-Vasselin, who won the opening set of his match with 64th-ranked Xavier Malisse before the Belgian retired injured. Fifth seed David Ferrer is safely through after a 6-1 6-4 6-2 win against Portugal\u2019s world No. 70 Rui Machado. The Spanish Davis Cup winner\u2019s next opponent will be Ryan Sweeting, the 68th-ranked American who beat Germany\u2019s Matthias Bachinger 6-4 6-4 6-2. French sixth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga fought his way to a  6-4 3-6 6-2 7-5 victory over Uzbekistan\u2019s Denis Istomin.  The 2008 runner-up set up a clash with 108th-ranked Brazilian Ricardo Mello, who defeated Spain\u2019s Roberto Bautista-Agut 6-4 6-4 7-5. Tsonga was joined in the last 64 by Davis Cup teammates Gilles Simon, Gael Monfils and Richard Gasquet \u2013 collectively known as \u201cthe New Musketeers\u201d by the French media. World No. 15 Monfils beat Australia\u2019s Marinko Matosevic 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 6-3 to earn a tie with Brazil\u2019s Thomaz Belluci, who eliminated Israel\u2019s Dudi Sela. Simon, seeded 12th, emerged victorious from a five-set marathon against Thailand\u2019s world No. 201 Danai Udomchoke to set up a clash with compatriot Julien Benneteau. Gasquet, the No. 17, will face Kazakhstan\u2019s Andrey Golubev after beating Italy\u2019s Andreas Seppi 6-3 3-6 6-3 6-1. Serbian ninth seed Janko Tipsarevic lost the opening set to Russia\u2019s Dmitry Tursunov, but scrapped to claim a 5-7 7-6 (14-12) 6-3 6-4 success and a place in round two against Australia\u2019s 20-year-old debutant James Duckworth. American Andy Roddick advanced with a 6-3 6-4 6-1 success over Dutch world No. 53 Robin Haase, and the 15th seed will next play fellow former world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt of Australia. The winner of that match will play either Canadian 23rd seed Milos Raonic or Germany\u2019s Philipp Petzschner in round three, with Djokovic looming after that. Japan\u2019s 24th seed Kei Nishikoro also went through, and will play either Simon or Benneteau if he beats Australia\u2019s 94th-ranked Matthew Ebden. Spanish 26th seed Marcel Granollers will play Tsonga or Mello if he defeats Portugal\u2019s Frederico Gil, while Argentina\u2019s world No. 29 Juan Ignacio Chela could face Ferrer if he gets past Spain\u2019s Pablo Andujar. Czech 29th seed Radek Stepanek crashed out 7-5 7-5 6-3 against French world No. 81 Nicolas Mahut, who will likely face Djokovic in round three if he overcomes Japan\u2019s Tatsuma Ito."

The Governor of Austria\u2019s Central Bank, Ewald Nowotny, described the downgrade as \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d and asserted: \u201cThe structure of the Austrian economy is well-balanced; output has been evolving dynamically at above-average rates; Austria has a sizeable current account surplus; and it is the EU country with the lowest unemployment rate [just 4 per cent].\u201d   But Austria has two problems. Its budget deficit has ballooned and now stands at 4.6 percent of GDP (although by European standards that\u2019s toward the lower end of the spectrum.) Finance Minister Maria Fekter told Austrian television Sunday that health spending, pension obligations and the state railway system are in the crosshairs as the government looks for annual budget savings in excess of $2 billion. Opposition parties say the government has been slow to act \u2013 knocking investor confidence. As in the United States and elsewhere in Europe there is fierce debate in Austria over the balance between tax increases and spending cuts to reduce the deficit. Secondly, Austria can\u2019t pick its neighbors. To the south is Italy, Austria\u2019s second largest trading partner, where the new technocratic government of Mario Monti is embarking on an austerity program and where the economy is struggling to avoid recession. Austrian banks do a lot of business in Italy and a lot in central and south-eastern Europe. Another neighbor is Hungary, where the government recently forced local banks to let millions of homeowners repay foreign currency loans at below market rates. That\u2019s hurting Hungarian banks because millions of householders took out mortgages in Swiss francs in recent years and now can\u2019t keep up with repayments.  And when Hungarian banks sneeze, Austrian banks catch cold. They have loans worth nearly $50 billion in Hungary alone. Last year, one major Austrian bank with considerable exposure in Hungary failed the European Union\u2019s \u201cstress tests\u201d \u2013 and has since been selling assets to fortify its balance sheet.  The Austrian government may have to pump more capital into the country\u2019s main banks, but for now Austrian banking officials tell CNN the banks can probably raise the capital they need to pass the next round of \u201cstress tests\u201d held by the European Banking Authority. Even so, Central Bank governor Nowotny acknowledges that measures need to be taken to \u201censure the sustainability of the business model of Austrian banks active in central and eastern Europe.\u201d There is only so much that the Austrians can do. Much depends on Hungary\u2019s tortured negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and the European Union over a bailout for its stricken finances. All three ratings agencies have reduced Hungary\u2019s credit-worthiness to \u201cjunk\u201d status. The chief Hungarian negotiator, Tamas Fellegi, is on a tour of European capitals this week, and sources in Vienna say he will meet the Austrian Finance Minister and Central Bank governor on Thursday. It should be an interesting exchange of views. The Austrians and the European Central Bank have been highly critical of \u201cpopulist\u201d measures by the Hungarian government led by Viktor Orban that have hurt the banking sector. But Orban is under pressure at home not to yield to international pressure. At the weekend, protesters took to the streets of Budapest with banners demanding \u201cHands Off Hungary.\u201d Some commentators have begun talking of Hungary as the \u201cGreece of eastern Europe.\u201d Reuters\u2019 Kathleen Brooks blogged last week: \u201cOnce again a small, relatively unknown economy is dominating the headlines and causing a massive headache for the European authorities.\u201d We\u2019ve been there before. In May 1931 Austria\u2019s largest bank, Credit Anstalt, collapsed suddenly. It had built up an unenviable portfolio of bad loans, but they were hidden from public view. As Austrians raced to retrieve their savings, and governments squabbled over a rescue package, panic spread quickly to other European countries. Banks in the Netherlands and Poland collapsed. Some economic historians believe Anstalt\u2019s failure triggered what would become known as the Great Depression. "

        "content": "Transcripts published Tuesday capture the dramatic conversations between port officials and a cruise ship captain, who a judge ruled can be held under house arrest while Italian authorities investigate his role in last week\u2019s disaster. A judge ruled that Francesco Schettino must remain in custody pending a later decision on whether to release him while authorities investigate the running aground of the Costa Concordia on Italy\u2019s Tuscan coast. But the judge said Schettino can be held on house arrest rather than in jail pending that decision, said his attorney, Bruno Leporatti. The captain has promised to cooperate with authorities, the lawyer said. Chief prosecutor Francesco Verusio said he did not know the grounds for the decision, which was made after the Tuesday afternoon court hearing. \u201cI am speechless,\u201d he said. An Italian port official swore in frustration at the captain of the stricken vessel after it struck rocks Friday night, ordering him at least 10 times to return to the cruise liner and coordinate rescue efforts, transcripts of the recorded conversations published Tuesday show. \u201cYou get on board! This is an order!\u201d the port official told Schettino. \u201cYou have declared \u2018Abandon ship.\u2019 Now I\u2019m in charge. You get on board \u2013 is that clear?\u201d the official said in one of the conversations published by the Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra. Schettino says at one point that he wants to go back on board, then refers to \u201cother rescuers\u201d and says something about a lifeboat being stuck. \u201cGet on board the ship and you tell me how many people are on board. \u2026 Clear? You tell me if there are children, women, people with special needs,\u201d a coast guard officer tells Schettino.  \u201cGet on board, (expletive)!\u201d the officer curses in frustration. During one conversation, Schettino first says he abandoned ship, only to appear to reverse course under questioning by an official, saying he was \u201ccatapulted into the water\u201d but remained on scene to coordinate the rescue. \u201cI did not abandon any ship,\u201d Schettino said, according to the transcripts. Italian prosecutors confirmed that the quotes match ones in a transcript they were using in their investigation. Schettino is under investigation by Italian authorities for his role in the disaster, which has claimed at least 11 lives. Prosecutors say Schettino was on the bridge at the time and made a \u201cgrave error\u201d that led to the disaster. The Italian coast guard and Costa Cruises, which owns the ship, are investigating why Schettino took the ship so close to land in an area known for its rocky sea floor. \u201cPreliminary indications are that there may have been significant human error on the part of the ship\u2019s master, Capt. Francesco Schettino, which resulted in these grave consequences,\u201d Costa Cruises said.  \u201cThe route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore, and the captain\u2019s judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard Costa procedures,\u201d the statement added.  Corriere della Sera reported that Schettino came close to Giglio to salute Mario Palombo, a legend among Costa Cruises\u2019 commanders, and as a gesture to the only Giglio native on board, chief steward Antonello Tievoli. Speaking on Italian television, Schettino said the problem was an uncharted rock. \u201cOn the nautical chart, it was marked just as water,\u201d Schettino said.  But the Italian coast guard said the waters where the ship ran aground were well-mapped. Local fishermen say the island coast of Giglio is known for its rocky seafloor.  \u201cEvery danger in this area is on the nautical chart,\u201d coast guard Capt. Cosimo Nicastro said. \u201cThis is a place where a lot of people come for diving and sailing. \u2026 All the dangers are known.\u201d Local authorities and residents said they believe that after hitting the rock, which tore a hole in the hull, the ship sailed at least half a mile north. They believe Schettino then turned the ship around toward land, where it toppled. In addition to questions over how Schettino handled himself after the wreck, questions also lingered about whether the captain should have ordered an evacuation sooner and why no \u201cmayday\u201d distress signal was sent. At one point after the ship struck the rock, the ship returned a radio call from port officials saying that all was well and the ship was suffering only a \u201ctechnical problem,\u201d according to the transcripts. Schettino joined Costa in 2002 as a safety officer, served as a staff captain and was appointed captain in 2006, according to the cruise line. Like all Costa masters, the cruise line said, Schettino \u201chas been constantly trained, passing all tests.\u201d Schettino had never been involved in an accident before, said Costa chairman Pier Luigi Foschi.  Foschi also downplayed the possibility that alcohol may have played a role in the crash, saying he did not believe Schettino drank, and that all crew were subject to random drug and alcohol tests by Costa Cruises. The captain\u2019s attorney said in a statement Monday that Schettino was \u201cshattered, dismayed, saddened for the loss of lives and strongly disturbed.\u201d But, he said, Schettino is \u201cnonetheless comforted by the fact that he maintained during those moments the necessary lucidity to put in place a difficult emergency maneuver \u2026 bringing the ship to shallow waters.\u201d That move, Leporatti said, saved the lives of many passengers and crew members. Captain and consultant James Staples told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Tuesday night that he was \u201ctotally amazed\u201d by Schettino\u2019s actions. \u201cHe should have stayed on board that ship and coordinated the rescue attempts from the vessel.\u201d Staples said the Concordia should not have been so close to the rocky shore at night, with little or no room to maneuver. Passenger Alex Beach of New Mexico said crew members tried to assist passengers, but had no upper-level supervision.  The scene around lifeboats, many of which could not be launched, was chaotic. \u201cIt became a situation of every man for himself,\u201d she told Cooper."

        "content": "The European Commission warned Hungary Tuesday it faces legal action over controversial reforms introduced by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u2019s government. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the move reflects its determination to see that EU law is fully respected. \u201cWe hoped that the Hungarian authorities would make the changes necessary to guarantee respect of EU law,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis has not been the case so far, therefore we have decided to begin infringement proceedings.\u201d The actions concerns three issues, he said: the independence of the national central bank, the retirement age of judges, and the independence of the country\u2019s data protection authority. The commission is also seeking more information in regard to the independence of the judiciary, Barroso said. Both the European Union and International Monetary Fund have said they will refuse to extend aid to Hungary, which is struggling financially, unless the government in Budapest guarantees the independence of the central bank.  The organizations say they are concerned the Hungarian government will have undue influence over monetary policy. Orban is to meet Barroso in Brussels, Belgium, for talks next Tuesday, the latter said in his statement. \u201cHungary is a key member of the European family,\u201d Barroso said. \u201cWe do not want the shadow of doubt on respect for democratic principles and values to remain over the country any longer. The quicker that this is resolved, the better.\u201d Infringement proceedings are a step preceding legal action, intended to enable a state to make changes to conform with EU law rather than be taken to court. Barroso wrote to Orban in December requesting the withdrawal of two recent bills related to the country\u2019s financial stability and the central bank. Orban rejected the requests. The EU then raised the prospect of taking Hungary to the European Court of Justice, Europe\u2019s highest court, over Orban\u2019s constitutional overhaul. The string of constitutional changes introduced by Orban\u2019s center-right government have generated much controversy within Hungary, where his party, Fidesz, has a dominant position in Parliament. Tens of thousands of people protested against the new constitution in Budapest earlier this month, demanding that Orban resign. The demonstration, which lasted nearly five hours, was organized by opposition parties and civil society groups who say the new constitution is anti-democratic. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed similar concerns last year, pushing Orban to commit to \u201cthe independence of the judiciary, a free press, and governmental transparency.\u201d The government has defended itself and blamed opposition parties for bringing the country to the brink of economic and political collapse. It says it is trying to resolve a problem spawned by the previous Socialist government. The new constitution, which took effect January 1, omits \u201crepublic\u201d from Hungary\u2019s official name, and includes several paragraphs that Amnesty International says violate international human rights. The human rights organization has been critical of sections that define life as beginning at conception and marriage as being between a man and a woman. It also expressed concerns about the possibility of life imprisonment without parole, and the failure to forbid discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. The demonstration earlier this month was preceded by a series of protests in 2011 against laws introduced by Hungary\u2019s populist government. Critics have said that a new media law is restrictive and that a new electoral law favors Orban\u2019s party. They have also taken aim at a law criminalizing homelessness."

        "content": "Italian rescuers and divers continuing their perilous work Tuesday located a second \u201cblack box\u201d and the remains of five people in the wreckage of the Costa Concordia cruise ship. Eleven people were confirmed dead after the ship ran aground late Friday off a Tuscan island. With nearly two dozen people still missing from the ship, which is lying on its side off Giglio, a judge allowed its captain to be held on house arrest pending a later decision on whether he should be released. Capt. Francesco Schettino is under arrest and may face charges that include manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning a ship when passengers were still on board, chief prosecutor Francesco Verusio said. Judge: Captain can be held under house arrest In dramatic transcripts of conversations between Schettino and the Italian coast guard, published by the Corriere della Sera newspaper, the captain gives conflicting accounts of what happened when the ship hit rocks Friday night just off Italy\u2019s western coast, leading to what passengers described as a chaotic and surreal scene as they rushed to evacuate. At first, Schettino tells an official he had abandoned the vessel, according to the transcripts, which prosecutors say match those they are using in their investigation. iReporter recalls first Concordia crash But as the official questions his decision, Schettino appears to reverse course and say he had not abandoned ship but was \u201ccatapulted into the water\u201d at some point after the ship ran into a rock, began taking on water and started listing. In a later conversation, an Italian coast guard official demands Schettino return to his ship, the transcripts show. \u201cYou get on board! This is an order!\u201d the coast guard official instructed Schettino. \u201cYou have declared \u2018Abandon ship.\u2019 Now I\u2019m in charge. You get on board \u2013 is that clear?\u201d the port official said.  Port Authority to cruise ship captain: \u2018Get on board, damn it\u2019 Rescue and recovery efforts continued Tuesday, with divers searching the ship for survivors and remains. It was unclear exactly how many people were missing. There were roughly 4,200 people on the Costa Concordia when it ran aground \u2013 about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members, the vast majority of whom made it off the ship safely. Before the discovery of the five bodies Tuesday, authorities had said 29 people were missing, including 14 Germans, six Italians, four French citizens, two Americans, and one each from Hungary, India and Peru. There was continued confusion Tuesday about the number of missing Germans, according to the German Foreign Ministry. One person on the list of missing was found dead Monday, but authorities have not specified which one it is. A friend of two missing Americans, Gerald and Barbara Ann Heil of White Bear Lake, Minnesota, said their family is \u201cholding up very well\u201d despite the agonizing wait for word from Italy, where the retired couple had gone for \u201ctheir trip of a lifetime\u201d after raising four children and working in their community for years. St. Pius X Catholic Church will hold a Wednesday evening prayer service for the couple, according to CNN affiliate KARE. The Heils were on a 16-day vacation to Italy, with a planned visit to the Vatican. In addition to the dead and missing passengers and crew, the wreck has given rise to concern about environmental damage.  The ship had about 2,300 tons of fuel on board at the time of the wreck, said Costa Cruises chairman and chief executive Pier Luigi Foschi.  But he said that so far there was \u201cabsolutely no evidence of fuel leaking into the sea.\u201d The ship appeared stable and its fuel tanks were intact Tuesday, said Martin Schuttenaer, a spokesman for Boskalis, the parent company of Dutch Smit and Salvage, which has monitors in place to keep track of the ship\u2019s movement. He said equipment to begin transferring the ship\u2019s fuel will be ready on Wednesday, but  the current priority is rescue and recovery. After sinking, some wonder: Is cruising safe? Divers have been searching the skyscraper-sized ship, working underwater in pitch blackness. Italy\u2019s Coast Guard said it has located a second \u201cblack box,\u201d or data recorder, from the ship. Operations were under way to retrieve the recorder, said Coast Guard Warrant Petty Officer Massimo Macaroni. Information from the device, along with that from another that has already been recovered and is being analyzed by prosecutors, will provide authorities with \u201ca complete picture of how the disaster unfolded,\u201d Macaroni said. Micky Arison, chairman of Carnival Corp, parent company of Costa Cruises, said he was saddened by the reports of additional deaths. \u201cOur immediate priority continues to be supporting rescue and recovery efforts and looking after our guests and crew members, along with securing the vessel to ensure there is no environmental impact.\u201d Survivors described the panic that ensued after the ship\u2019s collision with the rocks. Lauren Moore of Bowling Green, Kentucky, said many lifeboats were full when she and others reached the upper deck \u201cPeople were crying. People were hysterical,\u201d Moore said. \u201cPeople were screaming at each other.\u201d Cruise disaster hits Carnival stock, profits Italian prosecutors have ruled out a technical error as the cause of the incident, saying the captain was on the bridge at the time and had made a \u201cgrave error.\u201d Prosecutors are considering whether others may share responsibility for the crash with the captain. Foschi placed blame for the wreck squarely on the captain, saying Schettino had deviated from frequently traveled routes. \u201cThe captain decided to change the route and he went into water that he did not know in advance,\u201d Foschi said. Foschi said passengers would get \u201cmaterial compensation for their loss,\u201d but declined to go into details. One person who was scheduled to board the Concordia on Saturday said he was offered a refund, but will not get the refund for three months. Built in 2006, the Concordia had been on a Mediterranean cruise from Rome with stops in Savona, Marseille, Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca, Cagliari and Palermo. Questions have arisen over regulation of the industry, and the size of some cruise ships. Human error can\u2019t be regulated, said an official with Cruise Lines International Association, which represents the industry. \u201cThe fact is that this industry is remarkably safe,\u201d said executive vice president Michael Crye. \u201cIt has had a history that is very good compared to virtually any other means of transportation.\u201d Nautilus International, a maritime employees trade union, called the accident a \u201cwake-up call\u201d to regulators. \u201cNautilus is concerned about the rapid recent increases in the size of passenger ships, with the average tonnage doubling over the past decade,\u201d said Nautilus general secretary Mark Dickinson in a statement. \u201cMany ships are now effectively small towns at sea, and the sheer number of people onboard raises serious questions about evacuation.\u201d Crye said regulations have kept pace with the increasing size of the vessels. Safety rules are set through the International Maritime Organization, an agency of the United Nations. It said Monday that while the investigation of the wreck is in its early stages, \u201cWe should seriously consider the lessons to be learned and, if necessary, re-examine the regulations on the safety of large passenger ships in the light of the findings of the casualty investigation.\u201d Maritime law attorney Richard Alsina said the agency has little teeth and is dealing with an industry that has a strong lobby. \u201cThere is no general policing out there. They pretty much run their own show.\u201d"

        "content": "The United Kingdom cannot deport a radical cleric linked to al Qaeda to Jordan because evidence obtained by torture could be used against him there, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in a landmark case Tuesday. Abu Qatada has been fighting to remain in the United Kingdom since he was first arrested under anti-terrorism legislation nearly a decade ago. He would be \u201cat real risk of ill-treatment or a grossly unfair trial if deported to Jordan, where he is wanted on terrorism charges,\u201d the court said in a statement announcing the ruling. British officials have described the Jordanian national as an \u201cinspiration\u201d for terrorists such as Mohammed Atta, the lead hijacker behind the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States. Abu Qatada appealed to the European Court following a British court ruling in 2009 ordering his deportation. The court in Strasbourg rejected most of his appeal, but did say there would be a violation of his right to a fair trial if he were sent to Jordan. It was the first time the court has ever found that expelling a person would violate their rights to a fair trial, it said, \u201cwhich reflects the international consensus that the use of evidence obtained through torture makes a fair trial impossible.\u201d The ruling is not final. Either side has three months to appeal. Abu Qatada \u2013 also known as Omar Othman \u2013 arrived in the United Kingdom in 1993 and applied for asylum on the grounds that he had been tortured by Jordanian authorities. But the British government subsequently claimed that he is a national security risk who raised money for terrorist groups, including organizations linked to Osama bin Laden; and that he publicly supported the violent activities of those groups. Qatada has denied the allegations.  In his 2009 judgment, Jonathan Mance ruled, \u201cThere is no real risk that his trial in Jordan would be flagrantly unfair in character, course or consequences.\u201d Qatada came to the United Kingdom on a forged United Arab Emirates passport, according to court documents, and claimed asylum for himself, his wife and their three children. The UK government recognized him as a refugee and allowed him to stay in the country until 1998. Qatada applied to stay indefinitely but, while his application was pending, a Jordanian court convicted him in absentia for involvement in two 1998 terrorist attacks and a plot to plant bombs to coincide with the millennium. By 2002, the UK government said it suspected Qatada was a terrorist and a national security risk. Refusing him leave to stay in Britain, it ordered he be deported and detained him. In June 2008, a three-judge appeals panel freed Qatada under strict bail conditions, including fitting him with an electronic monitoring tag and ordering that he stay at home for 22 hours each day."

        "content": "Manchester City have gone three points clear at the top of the English Premier League after Edin Dzeko\u2019s first-half header proved enough to give them a 1-0 win at bottom club Wigan. In a match of few clear-cut chances, Bosnian striker Dzeko provided the one moment of quality, flicking David Silva\u2019s 22nd minute  free-kick into the bottom corner of Wigan\u2019s net. It was Dzeko\u2019s first goal in 11 matches and provided the difference between the two sides, who are separated by the entire length of the table. Who are football\u2019s top January transfer targets? Dzeko\u2019s strike partner Sergio Aguero missed two clear chances to double City\u2019s lead, one which followed a mazy run which saw him beat a host of Wigan defenders before Dzeko got in his way as he was about to shoot. At the other end, England goalkeeper Joe Hart was alert to keep out James McArthur\u2019s snap-shot with his feet. City are on 51 points from their 21 games, three ahead of champions Manchester United and five clear of third-placed Tottenham, whom they entertain next weekend.  Wigan remain rooted to the bottom of the table on 15 points, but they are just two points away from safety. Meanwhile, Napoli failed to significantly close the gap on the leading teams in Italy\u2019s Serie A after they were held to a 1-1 home draw by Bologna. Despite the home side enjoying most of the early pressure, it was Bologna who broke away to take a 14th minute lead. Nico Pulzetti\u2019s through ball split the Napoli defense and Robert  Acquafresca was left alone to confidently slot past goalkeeper Morgan De Sanctis. But Napoli\u2019s pressure finally told when they were awarded a penalty with 20 minutes remaining after Diego Perez was adjudged to have handled the ball just inside the area. Bologna were incensed by the decision but Edinson Cavani held his nerve to smash home the spot-kick. The result means Napoli remain sixth in the table, 10 points behind leaders Juventus, while Bologna are down in 16th position, just two places above the relegation zone."

        "content": "The editor of Britain\u2019s Daily Mirror told a press ethics investigation Monday that he had no knowledge of phone hacking at the tabloid, though it \u201cmight well have\u201d taken place at the tabloid newspaper without his knowledge. Richard Wallace made the comments under questioning by lawyer David Barr at the ongoing Leveson Inquiry, a wide-ranging government-backed investigation of British press ethics and practices. James Hipwell, a former employee of the Daily Mirror, testified last month that phone hacking \u201chappened every day\u201d at the Mirror\u2019s show business desk in late 1999, though he provided no specific evidence. In a separate case, Hipwell was convicted in a stock-tip scandal in 2005. Wallace was the show business editor at the paper from October 1999 to October 2000. Barr pressed Wallace on Hipwell\u2019s testimony, asking him whether the allegations of phone hacking were true. \u201cNo, not to my knowledge,\u201d Wallace said. Barr followed up by asking whether it was \u201cpossible it was going on, but being hidden from you?\u201d Wallace responded: \u201cIt might well have been.\u201d When asked about the paper\u2019s revealing of a celebrity affair in 2002 while he was the head of news, Wallace said, \u201cit\u2019s possible\u201d the tip about the affair may have come from intercepted voice mail messages \u2013 again without his knowledge. \u201cI don\u2019t recall the exact nature of (the source),\u201d Wallace said, adding, \u201cIt could have come from anywhere, really.\u201d The period of time in question occurred during Piers Morgan\u2019s tenure as editor of the newspaper. Morgan, now a CNN anchor, left the paper in 2004; Wallace replaced him as editor. Hipwell said in his December testimony that he \u201ccannot prove\u201d that Morgan knew about illegal eavesdropping, but that it was \u201cvery unlikely he did not know what was going on.\u201d Morgan has vigorously denied ordering phone hacking at any point during his career.  Morgan testified at the inquiry last month that he did not believe phone hacking had taken place when he was editor of the tabloid. Speaking by video link, he tenaciously defended himself against accusations that he knew more about phone hacking. The Leveson Inquiry was prompted by public and political outrage at the revelation that another tabloid, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News of the World, hacked into the phone of a missing teenage girl who later turned out to have been murdered. Murdoch\u2019s son James ordered the best-selling paper closed over the scandal. Much of the inquiry \u2013 and a related police investigation \u2013 focus on allegations of phone hacking by the News of the World."

        "content": "The Duchess of York, who faces charges in Turkey for going undercover and secretly filming children at a state-run home for a 2008 documentary, canceled a recent trip to the United States because of the case, a source and her spokesman said. The United States and Turkey have an extradition treaty and the cancellation raised the question of whether Sarah Ferguson is avoiding the United States because she fears being sent to Turkey. The treaty, in fact, was a factor in her decision, a source close to Ferguson said. The source described the duchess as \u201cpretty shaken\u201d and \u201cquite scared.\u201d Ferguson\u2019s spokesman, however, said the duchess was advised she could travel to the United States, but her priority right now is to stay in Britain and focus on the case.  She feels the work she did in Turkey was completely valid and consistent with her ongoing support for humanitarian causes, spokesman James Henderson told CNN. Ferguson is consulting rights lawyers as well as attorneys in Turkey as she decides what to do next, he said. The Ankara prosecutor\u2019s office in Turkey accused the duchess of violating the private lives and rights of five children while filming a program for Britain\u2019s ITV network, Turkey\u2019s semiofficial Anatolian news agency reported last week.  A hidden camera was used during Ferguson\u2019s visit to the Children\u2019s Nurturing and Rehabilitation Center outside Ankara. She wore a disguise of a dark wig and headscarf for the filming. Discussing the case, the Ankara chief prosecutor asked for a prison term of up to 22 years, six months, Turkish state TV reported. There were no details on when a trial might take place, if at all. A UK Home Office spokesman said: \u201cIt is not our usual policy to comment on individual cases.  \u201cHowever, the Home Office can confirm it has received a formal request for mutual legal assistance concerning Sarah, Duchess of York. It is not appropriate to comment further.\u201d What Ferguson is accused of in Turkey would not constitute a crime in Britain. The Duchess of York said in a statement: \u201cI stand strong in the face of the rights of children, and I remain steadfast. Children are our future.\u201d ITV News spokesman Grant Cunningham said Friday: \u201cITV was made aware yesterday through media reports of charges related to our program being raised again. \u201cCharges were raised in 2008 and we said at that time that we firmly stand by our program and our position remains unchanged.\u201d The duchess was accompanied by one of her two daughters, Princess Eugenie, to film the ITV Tonight program in Turkey. An ITV press statement at the time of the film\u2019s broadcast in 2008 said the duchess, as part of a reporting team, had gone \u201cundercover in one of Turkey\u2019s worst institutions \u2013 capturing images that will shock and horrify.\u201d The \u201chard-hitting\u201d program was intended to \u201chelp investigate the treatment of mentally and physically disabled children,\u201d ITV said. The duchess and her other daughter, Beatrice, traveled to Romania to see how state orphanages run for the second half of the program. Ferguson is a former member of the royal family, having been married to Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s son, Andrew, Duke of York. The couple divorced in 1996, after 10 years of marriage."

        "content": "An early warning radar station that is part of NATO\u2019s controversial missile defense system in Europe is now operational in Turkey, a foreign ministry spokesman said Monday. The station is located in the city of Malatya, about 400 miles southeast of the capital Ankara, and is manned by both Turkish and U.S. personnel, the spokesman said. Turkey is one of five countries that have agreed to deploy parts of the U.S.-designed defense system. Portugal, Poland, Romania and Spain have also agreed to participate. NATO asked Russia to participate in the system but negotiations have been deadlocked over Russia\u2019s demand for a legally binding treaty guaranteeing the shield would not be used as a deterrent to Moscow\u2019s own systems.  The United States and its European allies have insisted the system is directed toward countering ballistic missile threats from such  Middle East countries as Iran. Iran \u2013 Turkey\u2019s eastern neighbor \u2013 has publicly objected to the NATO system.  Ali Larijani, Iran\u2019s speaker of parliament, repeated his opposition to it during a visit to Turkey last week. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has said he hopes a political agreement with Moscow can be reached before a summit between NATO and Russia in Chicago this spring. That is when NATO is expected to declare an interim operational capability of the defense system. The only Muslim-majority country in the NATO alliance, Turkey is a critical ally to the United States, both in the region and globally. \u201cThe fact that they are willing to accept a defense radar system, I think it\u2019s important for us to work closely with Turkey at this critical time because they can be an important ally and an important influence on the direction in the Middle East,\u201d U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said last month during a visit to the Middle East."

        "content": "Chelsea have completed the signing of England international defender Gary Cahill from Premier League rivals Bolton Wanderers for a fee of $10.7m. The 26-year-old finalized his protracted move on Monday after agreeing personal terms and passing a medical, making it the biggest English transfer so far during the January window.  Cahill has signed a five-and-a-half year contract with the London club, despite doubts beginning to surface about the deal due to the length of time negotiations over his financial terms took. Who are football\u2019s top January transfer targets? He told the official Chelsea website:  \u201cChelsea are a massive club. They look to win trophies season in season out and it is a big opportunity for me to be a part of that.  \u201cOpportunities like this, you just can\u2019t turn down,\u201d added Cahill, who has won seven England caps and will be battling with Brazilian David Luiz to partner England captain John Terry at the heart of the Chelsea defense. Speaking on Saturday about Cahill\u2019s impending arrival, Chelsea manager Andre Villas Boas told reporters: \u201cHe has good technical abilities which is important in the way we want to play and to implement our philosophy. \u201cCompetition will be tight for him but we brought him in to become better as a team.\u201d Cahill joined Bolton from Aston Villa in January 2008 and developed into one of England\u2019s top defenders during his four years at the Reebok Stadium. However, he had already indicated he was not prepared to sign a new contract, meaning Wanderers were forced to sell him or lose him for free at the end of the season. Meanwhile, the Carlos Tevez transfer saga has taken a new twist after Inter Milan president Massimo Moratti confirmed the Italian club had made a $31.7 million bid for Manchester City\u2019s Argentine striker. Speaking to reporters after Inter\u2019s 1-0 victory over city rivals AC Milan, Moratti said: \u201cOur offer is 25 million euros \u2013 now it depends on them whether they accept it or not.\u201d Inter have emerged as favorites to sign Tevez, after Milan pulled out of the race last week when their plan to sell Alexandre Pato to Paris St Germain fell through following the Brazilian\u2019s decision to stay at the San Siro. Ironically big-spending PSG now seem the only realistic challengers for Tevez, who has fallen out of favor at City after refusing to come off the substitutes\u2019 bench during the 3-1 Champions League defeat at Bayern Munich earlier in the season. Elsewhere in the Premier League, Blackburn central defender Chris Samba has handed in a written transfer request, despite Rovers manager Steve Kean saying the player was not for sale. The Congolese international has already been the subject of a rejected bid from QPR, while title-chasing Tottenham and French big spenders PSG have also been linked with the player. Samba issued a statement saying: \u201cIn my five years at Blackburn I have always given 100% in every game I have played. I have had several opportunities to leave but I have always stayed. \u201cI have decided now is the right time for me to pursue a new challenge and  I have asked the club to respect my decision and allow me to leave.\u201d In other transfer news, Barcelona have announced that French defender Eric Abidal has signed a new deal with the club. The 32-year-old, who had been linked with a move away from the Nou Camp, is now contracted to the European champions until June 2013, with an option to extend the deal until 2015. Abidal has made 177 appearances in four years with Barca, winning the Champions League twice and the Spanish La Liga three times.    "

        "content": "An opposition coalition said Monday it is planning mass demonstrations in Romania, following four straight days of citizen protests against government austerity measures. The coalition will meet to formalize protest plans, said Crin Antonescu, liberal opposition leader, adding the group disagrees with the way in which the government has handled the citizen demonstrations. \u201cThe National Liberal Party asks the prime minister and his cabinet to resign immediately because they couldn\u2019t manage the violent protests held over the last couple of days in Bucharest,\u201d Antonescu said.  Thousands of citizens have gathered in the capital and 40 other Romanian cities, protesting government austerity measures and calling for the ouster of President Traian Basescu, as well as early elections. In Bucharest, police had to use tear gas on demonstrators Sunday. As of Sunday night, more than 2,000 police officers were on the streets of the capital.  On Saturday, police and protesters clashed in Bucharest\u2019s University Square. Seventeen people were injured.  The demonstrations are the most serious since Basescu\u2019s election in 2004. Banks, shops and bus stations in the capital were vandalized, said Bucharest Mayor Sorin Oprescu. Nearly 250 people were fined for disturbing the peace, government officials said, and 36 will be investigated for alleged violent acts. Stones and Molotov cocktails were thrown by protesters, the officials said. So far, 59 people have been injured in the protests, with 26 treated at hospitals. The injured include 10 police officers and several journalists, officials said.  The protesters blocked traffic over the weekend, waving flags with the centers ripped out to symbolize the 1989 communist revolution. Others carried signs reading \u201cLiberty\u201d and \u201cDown with President Basescu.\u201d \u201cThe violence is unacceptable,\u201d said Prime Minister Emil Boc. \u201cI ask Romanians to understand that the government took those austerity measures in order to avoid a crisis.\u201d Interior Minister Traian Igas held an emergency meeting on Monday. The protests broke out last Thursday after the resignation of Deputy Health Minister Raed Arafat, an opponent of health care reforms proposed by the government. Facing public pressure, Basescu decided to scrap the reforms Friday, saying he made the decision after realizing that a majority of those in the medical system opposed the change. \u201cThe hospitals don\u2019t want the change, the (doctors) don\u2019t want the change and neither does the emergency health care system,\u201d Basescu said. Critics had argued that the proposal favored the private health care system by allowing access to government funds while the state-funded system lacks financial aid. The protests also follow several unpopular measures taken by the government over the past two years. After receiving a loan of 20 billion euros from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union in 2009, the government cut salaries in the public sector by 25% a year later to enforce austerity measures recommended by the IMF. Protesters over the weekend blamed the government for their poor living standards.  \u201cWe have no financial security. My husband and I are retired but we are sharing our modest income with our children because they are jobless,\u201d said Rodica Ganea, who described being asked during hospital visits to pay for \u201cmedicines, syringes, bandages, everything \u2026 I can\u2019t afford it.\u201d \u201cMy kids are university graduates but they are jobless,\u201d said Marilena Salan, 64. \u201cThey are forced to break up their families, leave their kids home and go abroad to work. My nephews are growing up without their parents. This is unacceptable.\u201d "

        "content": "Downgrade \u2013 the most feared word in Europe\u2019s financial lexicon. Most attention Friday was focused on France, Europe\u2019s second-largest economy, as Standard & Poor\u2019s cut its rating on French sovereign debt. But the debt of several other countries also received the Mark of Cain, including Italy, Spain, Portugal \u2013 and Austria, whose debt rating was cut by one notch from its AAA status. Austria\u2019s inclusion might come as a surprise to those who don\u2019t follow the bond markets. Its economy \u2013 by European standards \u2013 is thriving. The governor of Austria\u2019s Central Bank, Ewald Nowotny, described the downgrade as \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d and asserted: \u201cThe structure of the Austrian economy is well-balanced; output has been evolving dynamically at above-average rates; Austria has a sizeable current account surplus; and it is the EU country with the lowest unemployment rate (4%).\u201d But Austria has two problems. First, its budget deficit has ballooned and now stands at 4.6% of GDP (although by European standards that\u2019s toward the lower end of the spectrum.) Finance Minister Maria Fekter told Austrian television Sunday that health spending, pension obligations and the state railway system are in the cross hairs as the government looks for annual budget savings in excess of $2 billion. Opposition parties say the government has been slow to act \u2013 knocking investor confidence. And, as in the United States and elsewhere in Europe, there is fierce debate in Austria over the balance between tax increases and spending cuts to reduce the deficit. Second, Austria can\u2019t pick its neighbors. To the south is Italy, Austria\u2019s second-largest trading partner, where the new technocratic government of Mario Monti is embarking on an austerity program and where the economy is struggling to avoid recession. Austrian banks do a lot of business in Italy \u2013 and a lot in central and southeastern Europe. Another neighbor is Hungary, where the government recently forced local banks to let millions of homeowners repay foreign currency loans at below market rates. That\u2019s hurting Hungarian banks because millions of householders took out mortgages in Swiss francs in recent years and now can\u2019t keep up with repayments. And when Hungarian banks sneeze, Austrian banks catch cold. They have loans worth nearly $50 billion in Hungary alone. Last year, one major Austrian bank with considerable exposure in Hungary failed the European Union\u2019s \u201cstress tests\u201d \u2013 and has since been selling assets to fortify its balance sheet. The Austrian government may have to pump more capital into the country\u2019s main banks, but for now Austrian banking officials tell CNN the banks can probably raise the capital they need to pass the next round of \u201cstress tests\u201d held by the European Banking Authority. Even so, Central Bank Governor Nowotny acknowledges that measures need to be taken to \u201censure the sustainability of the business model of Austrian banks active in Central and Eastern Europe.\u201d There is only so much that the Austrians can do. Much depends on Hungary\u2019s tortured negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and the European Union over a bailout for its stricken finances. All three ratings agencies have reduced Hungary\u2019s credit-worthiness to \u201cjunk\u201d status. The chief Hungarian negotiator, Tamas Fellegi, is on a tour of European capitals this week \u2013 and sources in Vienna say he will meet the Austrian Finance Minister and Central Bank governor on Thursday. It should be an interesting exchange of views. The Austrians (and the European Central Bank) have been highly critical of \u201cpopulist\u201d measures by the Hungarian government led by Viktor Orban that have hurt the banking sector. But Orban is under pressure at home not to yield to foreign pressure. At the weekend, protestors took to the streets of Budapest with banners demanding \u201cHands Off Hungary.\u201d Some commentators have begun talking of Hungary as the \u201cGreece of Eastern Europe.\u201d Reuters\u2019 Kathleen Brooks blogged last week: \u201cOnce again a small, relatively unknown economy is dominating the headlines and causing a massive headache for the European authorities.\u201d We\u2019ve been there before. In May 1931 Austria\u2019s largest bank, Credit Anstalt, collapsed suddenly. It had built up an unenviable portfolio of bad loans, but they were hidden from public view. As Austrians raced to retrieve their savings and governments squabbled over a rescue package, panic spread quickly to other European countries. Banks in the Netherlands and Poland collapsed. Some economic historians believe Anstalt\u2019s failure triggered what would become known as the Great Depression."

        "content": "Environmental campaign group Greenpeace has warned that if oil leaks from the stricken cruise liner Costa Concordia it could cause an environmental disaster, threatening marine life including birds, whales and sharks. At least six people died when the huge ship hit rocks and slid onto its side. The vessel \u2013 containing hundreds of tons of fuel oil \u2013 is now partially submerged off the Italian island of Giglio, which lies inside the Pelagos Sanctuary for Mediterranean Marine Mammals. The sanctuary was set up 10 years ago in an agreement between France, Italy and Monaco, with about half of it existing in international waters. Pelagos is a haven for many marine species including the fin whale, sperm whale, bottlenose dolphin, tuna, swordfish and sharks, as well as supporting sea bird populations. Greenpeace has previously criticized what it called a lack of management of the sanctuary and warned regional governments about ship congestion, particularly in the straits between Corsica and Sardinia. In a 2010 report the group highlighted the large number of ships in the area and says it has spoken to cruise companies about the risk of pollution from their ships.  Greenpeace Pelagos report (in Italian) \u201cIf all this fuel is lost it is going to be a serious disaster,\u201d said Greenpeace Pelagos expert Alessandro Gianni. \u201cFuel oil is much worse than diesel. It\u2019s sticky, very heavy. They must ensure they clean the tanks as fast as possible and then remove the shipwreck,\u201d he said. Italian Environment Minister Corrado Clini told Italian newspaper La Repubblica: \u201cWe have to hurry because if the weather changes the situation could get worse. We must protect our natural heritage and landscape.\u201d Clini has already given backing to a plan to restrict cruise ships in the Venetian lagoon and said in an interview with La Stampa that he would consider a levy on passengers to protect the coastline. Greenpeace is particularly concerned about the Mediterranean fin whales which it says spend the winter off the northern coast of Africa and then migrate to summer feeding ground inside the sanctuary. They are the second longest whale in the ocean after the blue whale, and the International Whaling Commission has previously reported concern about the high number of collisions with ships. \u201cIf there is pollution this could have a big effect on the migration of the whales,\u201d said Gianni. Costa chairman and chief executive Pier Luigi Foschi confirmed that the vessel is carrying 2,300 tons of oil, split between heavy fuel oil and gas oil. \u201cIt is in a sea we want to protect,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are taking steps to avoid environmental issues.\u201d In a statement, Costa Cruises said: \u201cWe have engaged the services of a worldwide leader, a specialized salvage company to develop an action plan and help establish a protection perimeter around the ship.\u201d A company spokesman added: \u201cThe main risk is the fuel. We are not aware of any leakage. At the moment we are not aware of any other contents which could be a problem.\u201d  The search for survivors and victims was suspended on Monday because the ship began to move. Greenpeace is concerned that other toxic substance that may be on board \u2013 such as lubricants and paints \u2013 could spill into the sea and get into the food chain.  "

        "content": "On board the Costa Concordia, thousands of passengers were dining, drinking, attending a magic show, perhaps trying their luck in the casino. It was Friday night on the luxury cruise liner, sailing in the Mediterranean off the Italian coast with about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members \u2013 a night of entertainment and relaxation. There was annoyance, but no real alarm, when the lights went out \u2013 not at first. Passenger Vivian Shafer said she thought it was part of the magic show. But those on board then heard an ominous scraping sound, and the 951-foot vessel gave a shudder. The ship began to list to one side.  Still, many passengers were not panicked. Shafer said they were told the problem was electrical and would be fixed soon. Her cabin steward told her there was nothing to worry about. But there was plenty to worry about: the Concordia had struck rocks off Italy\u2019s Giglio Island and was taking on water. As it dawned on them that something was wrong, passengers headed toward the lifeboats \u2013 accessible only on one side of the leaning ship. According to passengers\u2019 accounts, chaos ensued as guests rushed to fill the lifeboats and escape the ship. Some crew members helped passengers and then jumped overboard, passengers said; remaining crew members seemed helpless to handle the melee. \u201cWomen and children first,\u201d a lifeboat crew member announced \u2013 meaning families who were clinging to one another had to be separated. Passenger Benji Smith, who was on his honeymoon, made a rope ladder to climb down from the outer fourth deck to the third deck. He and his wife Emily clung to the ladder for more than three hours before they were picked up by a lifeboat. \u201cYou were going higher and higher, and you were on a vertical position,\u201d said Rosalyn Rincon, a dancer aboard the ship. \u201cI was holding on to the railing.\u201d Noise and creaks could be heard, she said. \u201cIt was very, very scary.\u201d Amanda Warrick, on the cruise with her brothers, said she thought several times that she might die. She and her siblings waited for at least an hour and a half for help after all the lifeboats had departed. \u201cWaiting was definitely the worst,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause we didn\u2019t know who was going to be coming, how much longer we would have to wait.\u201d Crew members were hard to find in the confusion, and little to no information was available about what to do or what was happening, passengers have said. Shafer said she wished the crew had directed passengers to grab warm clothes, coats or shoes, as there was time for them to do so. Authorities said no mayday distress signal was issued by the ship and are investigating. \u201cThe crew tried hard but they kept telling us they had no information,\u201d said American Nancy Lofaro. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until an hour into this situation that we got into a lifeboat and were lowered.\u201d In the haste, some lifeboats malfunctioned or were not operated properly, some said. \u201cAt one point we were being lowered, and we were sliding off to one side,\u201d Lofaro said. \u201cEveryone fell into one side of the boat and were slamming into the ship. This happened a few times over 30 seconds. And finally we were lowered into the water level. It took 30 minutes to get to shore \u2026 the lifeboats were slamming into each other. It was chaos.\u201d Lifeboats on the ship\u2019s higher side became stuck, leaving people suspended in mid-air amid the screams and cries of children, said passenger Laurie Willits. Some passengers braved the water, with a temperature of about 57 degrees, and swam to safety. Others had no choice, as they fell into the chilly water. Nighttime temperatures on Giglio have recently dipped below freezing. On shore, sirens blared as some of the 20 injured were taken to hospitals. Helicopters plucked some passengers off the ship\u2019s decks.  Many of those rescued were taken to churches and other buildings for shelter, some of them wearing the pajamas and slippers they had on when they left the ship. Cruise passengers are required by law to attend a safety briefing within 24 hours of embarkation. But passenger Benji Smith said the briefing was more of a \u201csales pitch\u201d for shore excursions. Others, who embarked at Civitavecchia, about an hour\u2019s train ride from Rome, had yet to have the briefing. As the Concordia came to rest on its side, a huge gash in its hull, rescue efforts were launched to locate those left unaccounted for, with rescuers working underwater in near-total darkness to scour the ship \u2013 which has 17 decks and some 1,500 cabins, eight bars, five restaurants, four swimming pools and a casino.  Three survivors were found \u2013 an Italian purser and two South Korean honeymooners. However, others were not so lucky. The bodies of two elderly people, both wearing life jackets, were found near one of the ship\u2019s restaurants.  And a 65-year-old woman died after suffering a heart attack, authorities said. Another body was found Monday, bringing the death toll to six. That toll could rise, especially in light of Italian coast guard chief Marco Brusco\u2019s revelation in a television interview, as reported by the state ANSA news agency, that 29 people are unaccounted for.  That figure includes two of the 120 Americans who were aboard the ship, the U.S. Embassy in Italy said.  Rescue efforts were suspended for a few hours Monday after the vessel began to shift and move, Giglio Mayor Sergio Ortelli said. They resumed later in the day, although the Italian coast guard said it was concerned about increasing winds in the forecast. Rough seas were also forecast for the area on Monday. Pier Luigi Foschi, Costa Cruises chairman and chief executive, told reporters he holds out hope others may still be alive. The ship has about 2,300 tons of fuel on board, Foschi said, adding that so far there is \u201cabsolutely no evidence of fuel leaking into the sea.\u201d As rescuers worked to find survivors and recover bodies, the Italian Coast Guard \u2013 as well as Carnival Corporation, the parent company of Costa Cruises \u2013 launched investigations into what went wrong. On Saturday, the ship\u2019s captain, Francesco Schettino, was detained and faces possible charges of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still on board, authorities said. The ship\u2019s data recorders were seized and were being analyzed by prosecutors. Schettino has denied abandoning ship, saying he and his crew were the last to leave the Concordia. Speaking on Italian television, he insisted the rocks were not marked on his map.  However, the coast guard maintained the waters are well-mapped, and local fishermen say Giglio\u2019s coast is known for its rocky sea floor. The Concordia was too close to the island, authorities have said, and was investigating why. One potential theory: Apparently the Concordia had a tradition of \u201ca kind of fly-by\u201d with Giglio island, where it would approach the island, those on board would wave and the ship would sound its horn, said CNN\u2019s Dan Rivers. It was unclear whether such a maneuver was being attempted and the ship got too close. On Sunday, Costa Cruises said in a statement there may have been \u201csignificant human error\u201d on Schettino\u2019s part.  \u201cThe route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore, and the captain\u2019s judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard Costa procedures,\u201d the statement said. However, Costa also defended its crew, saying crew members \u201cacted bravely and swiftly to help evacuate more than 4,000 individuals during a very challenging situation.\u201d Schettino\u2019s attorney, Bruno Leporatti, said in a statement Monday the captain was \u201cshattered, dismayed, saddened for the loss of lives and strongly disturbed\u201d over the incident. But, he said, Schettino was \u201ccomforted by the fact that he maintained during those moments the necessary lucidity to put in place a difficult emergency maneuver\u201d \u2013 steering the boat into shallow water, which saved lives. Schettino is set to appear in court Tuesday, where he will be questioned in a closed hearing."

        "content": "Having been criticized by his great rival Rafael Nadal for not taking a stand over players\u2019 rights, Roger Federer began his bid for a fifth Australian Open title with a comfortable straight-sets victory on Monday. The 16-time grand slam champion joined Nadal in round two, matching the Spaniard\u2019s smooth progress in Melbourne with a 7-5  6-2 6-2 win over Russia\u2019s Alexander Kudryavtsev. World No. 172 Kudryavtsev, making his tournament debut, matched the Swiss third seed early on as he battled to 5-5 in the first set. But Federer shrugged off pre-tournament back concerns as he conceded only four more games to beat a player who won just three ATP Tour matches last year. The 30-year-old, whose last major title came in Melbourne in 2010, will next play Germany\u2019s 93rd-ranked Andreas Beck. \u201cI really tried to put in an effort to every point, play as hard as I  could, first to see how the back felt, try to get into it, hopefully win, and then see how I feel tomorrow,\u201d Federer said, before insisting his relationship with Nadal had not been affected. \u201cThings are fine between us, you know. I have no hard feelings towards him. It\u2019s been a difficult last few months in terms of politics within the ATP,  I guess, trying to find a new CEO and chairman. That can get frustrating sometimes. But for me, obviously nothing changes in terms of our relationship.\u201d His fellow former world No. 1 Nadal came into the tournament having announced to international reporters that he would no longer be making statements about grievances over scheduling and pay. He then told Spanish media on Sunday that he thought ATP player council president Federer should take more of a public role over issues such as where the Davis Cup fits into the busy calendar. \u201cHis (position) is easy: do not say anything, all positive, I am a \u2018gentleman,\u2019 others get burned. We each have our opinion and maybe he likes the circuit. Me too, I like it, and I think it\u2019s better than most sports. That does not mean you cannot be better and that you should change things that are bad,\u201d the 25-year-old said ahead of Monday\u2019s 6-4 6-1 6-1 win over Ukraine-born American qualifier Alex Kuznetsov. \u201cI say a lot of good things about tennis, because thanks to this sport I have had experiences in my life I could never have dreamed of, but to finish your career with pain in all areas of your body is not positive. \u201cHe finishes his career as fresh as a daisy because he is physically privileged, but neither Murray nor Djokovic and I are fresh as a daisy.\u201d Nadal, the 2009 champion, had hoped he was over his injury problems going into the two-week event, but revealed after his opening win that he needed an MRI scan after hurting his right knee yet again in practice. \u201cI was much more scared about the first match than the rest, because today now I have 48 hours to the next match,\u201d said Nadal, who retired hurt against Andy Murray in 2010 and suffered a hamstring injury in last year\u2019s quarterfinal defeat by David Ferrer. \u201cSo I am really confident that having had the worst feeling that I ever had in my knee yesterday and today was able to play \u2013 I have fantastic hope that\u2019s going to happen the same for after tomorrow.\u201d He also admitted some remorse over his previous day\u2019s attack on Federer. \u201cProbably I am wrong telling that to you, especially because these things can stay, must stay in the locker room,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cI always had a fantastic relationship with Roger. I still have a fantastic relationship with Roger.\u201d Nadal, who could meet Federer in the semifinals, will next play Germany\u2019s former world No. 2 Tommy Haas. The 33-year-old Haas, now ranked 190th after years of injury problems, beat Ukraine-born U.S. resident Denis Kudla in four sets. Argentine 11th seed Juan Martin del Potro, the last man outside of defending champion Djokovic, Nadal and Federer to win a singles grand slam, progressed with a 2-6 6-1 7-5 6-4 win over France\u2019s 91st-ranked Adrian Mannarino. The 2009 U.S. Open champion will next play Slovenia\u2019s world No. 103 Blav Kavcic. Czech seventh seed Tomas Berdych also went through to round two along with American No. 8 Mardy Fish and No. 16 John Isner, Spanish No. 10 Nicolas Almagro and No. 18 Feliciano Lopez, Ukraine\u2019s No. 13 Alexandr Dolgopolov and Swiss No. 21 Stanislas Wawrinka. Isner will next play 2006 semifinalist David Nalbandian, whose Finnish opponent Jarkko Nieminen retired with a stomach muscle injury at 6-4 4-2 down the day after winning the rain-delayed Sydney Invitational title. Wawrinka will play Marcos Baghdatis, the 2006 runner-up from Cyprus who lost in the Sydney semis on Friday. Fish faces Colombia\u2019s 71st-ranked Alejandro Falla while Berdych plays Belgium\u2019s Olivier Rochus. Australian teenager Bernard Tomic eliminated Spanish 22nd seed Fernando Verdasco \u2013 a semifinalist in 2009 \u2013 and the 19-year-old will next play American Sam Querrey. Djokovic begins the defense of his title against Italy\u2019s Paolo Lorenzi on Tuesday, while last year\u2019s runner-up Andy Murray faces American teenager Ryan Harrison."

        "content": "American golfer Johnson Wagner celebrated a new year with a new look and new-found confidence as he booked his spot at the Masters in Augusta with victory at the Sony Open in Hawaii on Sunday. The 31-year-old clinched his third PGA Tour title and rocketed up 106 places in the rankings to 92nd as he took the early lead in the FedEx Cup series, scooping the $990,000 first prize. Sporting a mustache he started growing last year during the off-season, he carded a three-under-par 67 in his final round to win by two shots at the Waialae Country Club. \u201cI was definitely telling people to expect something early this year, which is a nice feeling,\u201d Wagner told the PGA Tour\u2019s official website after following up his tie for ninth place in the season-opening Tournament of Champions at Kapalua last weekend.  \u201cUsually, my confidence is low. I\u2019m kind of shy in a little shell. And for some reason, I just had way more energy and confidence going into this year.\u201d He revealed that he will keep his facial furniture after qualifying for April\u2019s opening major of the season, having won almost as much in two starts this year as he did in the whole of 2011 \u2013 when his only win came in Mexico in February. \u201cI kind of made a deal with myself in December that if I was to get into the Masters, then I was going to keep the mustache for at least this year,\u201d he said after a bogey-free last 12 holes saw him finish on 13 under ahead of a four-way tie for second.  \u201cEverybody said, \u2018Oh, is it a Movember mustache? Well, it\u2019s December, time to shave it.\u2019 I said, \u2018Look, this is not a one-month mustache. This is potentially a 10-year mustache.\u2019\u201d Behind Wagner on 11 under was Sweden-born Carl Petterson (67), playing in his first tournament since becoming a U.S. citizen, and Americans Sean O\u2019Hair (67), Harrison Frazar (67) and Charles Howell III (69). Their compatriots Michael Thompson (67), Brian Gay (67), D.A. Points (69) and Matt Every (72) tied for sixth on 10 under. John Rollins of the U.S. carded the best round of the day, hitting a superb 64 to finish alongside Canada\u2019s David Hearn (69) and Brendan de Jonge (71) of Zimbabwe in 10th. Keegan Bradley, the 2011 PGA Championship winner, shot 70 to finish on eight under in an six-way tie for 13th place. World No. 5 Steve Stricker, who won in Hawaii last Sunday, was nine shots behind Wagner after closing with 74. He was level with 2011 money list runner-up Webb Simpson (68), South Korean veteran K.J. Choi (71) and 2010 U.S. Ryder Cup captain Corey Pavin (71)."

        "content": "Mammoth cruise ships can be difficult to get around, even in the best of circumstances. In the worst \u2013 which is how one might describe the situation aboard the listing Costa Concordia \u2013 they are near impossible. Yet even before the sun rose Monday, about 120 rescue personnel were out in or around the liner that hit rocks near Tuscany and rolled spectacularly on its side.  They were in a race against time, and in a battle with numerous challenges, to try to save survivors or at least recover the bodies of the passengers and crew members who are still missing. Overheard on CNN.com: Worst-case scenario The search was temporarily suspended by noon Monday, after authorities said the vessel had begun to sway, making it dangerous for the crews. But it resumed a short time later, despite a forecast calling for increasingly strong winds that Coast Guard spokesman Filippo Marino said had rescuers worried.   They are \u201cworking in very, very bad conditions,\u201d said Luciano Roncalli of Italy\u2019s national fire service. \u201cIt\u2019s cold, of course. It\u2019s dark during the day and the night. \u2026 It\u2019s really, really dangerous.\u201d Authorities have said that at least six people died after the Costa Concordia hit rocks Friday night off the tiny island of Giglio, where nighttime temperatures have recently dipped below freezing.  A total of 29 people \u2013 four crew members and 25 passengers \u2013 are still unaccounted for from the listing cruise ship, Italian coast guard chief Marco Brusco said Monday, according to Italy\u2019s ANSA news agency. That figure includes two of the 120 Americans who were aboard the ship, the U.S. Embassy in Italy said.  Now turned on its side, the ship is roughly half-submerged. Rescuers hope is that any survivor has found refuge above water, or perhaps in an air pocket, and can be brought out alive. \u201cThere could still be people locked into compartments \u2026 where they can\u2019t physically move because of the twisting of the metal,\u201d said Butch Hendrick, president of the diving safety company Lifeguard Systems. In its current state, the Costa Concordia resembles a dark, convoluted cave \u2013 with its countless nooks and crannies and few ways to easily escape. Six underwater cave rescue divers are working among the rescue personnel.  The divers are likely equipped with twice as much oxygen as regular scuba divers, have a guideline nearby in case they need help finding a way back to safety, and have knives and whatever lights they can carry or wear, said Robert Laird, a co-founder of the International Underwater Cave Rescue and Recovery group. Still, whatever equipment and precautions they take, \u201cwhat they are doing is extremely difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you do not have the right frame of mind to deal with being in the dark and in tight closed spaces, then you\u2019re (in trouble),\u201d said Laird, who has dived in many caves and ships, though neither he nor his group are involved in the Italian operation.  Unlike open water divers, these divers don\u2019t have the luxury of coming up for air anytime they want, and they can\u2019t count on the help of sunlight. Laird said he expects that, besides being pitch-black, the water in the ship teems with debris. \u201cThey could swim right by a dead body and not even see it,\u201d Laird said. Rescuers are navigating a seeming labyrinth.  The Concordia is practically a skyscraper in two directions: 17 decks high and 951 feet long.  Emergency personnel are aiming to look into 1,500 cabins and all around the ship\u2019s many other public spaces, including eight bars, five restaurants, four swimming pools, a casino and more. Hendrick, a veteran of many such rescue dives, estimated it could take a couple of weeks for the whole ship to be checked. \u201cIt\u2019s enormous,\u201d said Richard Bordoni, another member of the Italian national fire corps. \u201cThey have to stay safe, and it takes them a long time to go down a corridor.\u201d Late Sunday, the cruise line said the ship\u2019s captain may have made \u201csignificant\u201d errors leading to the wreck and subsequent rescue effort.  \u201cThe route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore, and the captain\u2019s judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard Costa procedures,\u201d Costa Cruises said in a statement. Authorities told ANSA that the captain, Francesco Schettino, has been detained for alleged manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still on board.  Speaking on Italian television, Schettino insisted the rocks were not marked on his map. \u201cOn the nautical chart, it was marked just as water,\u201d Schettino said, adding that the ship was about 300 meters (1,000 feet) from shore. But the Italian coast guard insisted that the waters where the ship ran aground were well-mapped. Local fishermen say the island coast of Giglio is known for its rocky sea floor.  \u201cEvery danger in this area is on the nautical chart,\u201d Coast Guard Capt. Cosimo Nicastro said. \u201cThis is a place where a lot of people come for diving and sailing. \u2026 All the dangers are known.\u201d Survivors recounted a frantic rush by passengers to get on lifeboats, while the crew appeared helpless and unable to cope. \u201cIt was the Marx brothers, watching these guys trying to figure out how to work the boat,\u201d said passenger Benji Smith, recounting how he made his own rope ladder to save himself and his wife. \u201cI felt like the disaster itself was manageable, but I felt like the crew was going to kill us.\u201d Compounding the evacuation problems was that only one side of the boat\u2019s lifeboats was available, as the ship was listing.  Passenger Laurie Willits, from Ontario, Canada, said some lifeboats on the higher side got stuck, leaving people suspended in mid-air amid the sounds of children crying and screaming. \u201cIt was so crowded, and there was no room for us,\u201d said Brandon Warrick, who was sailing with his siblings. \u201cIt was just bad, like mad scrambles to get into the lifeboats. Nobody followed any procedure.\u201d Many questions remain:  Why was the ship \u2013 with about 3,000 passengers and 1,000 crew members \u2013 so close in to shore in an area where the seabed is pockmarked with rocks? What happened in the minutes after the ship ran aground? Why was no \u201cmayday\u201d distress signal sent? \u201cLooking at the pictures of the damage, it almost looks as if they saw it at the last minute, and they tried to swing the ship to the right to miss,\u201d said Chris McKesson, professor of naval architecture at the University of New Orleans. Whatever happened to cause the crash, what\u2019s happening now to deal with its aftermath \u2013 and, ideally, get to those still on board \u2013 is now the focus. Those rescue crews have to deal with not just myriad logistical difficulties, but also physical and mental challenges.  Emergency personnel in the open-air part of the ship need ropes to get around, because the floor has become the wall in most cases. Whether they are rappelling or swimming, doors may have to be opened upward, not the standard way, given the position of the ship. \u201cThe doors are very heavy, and the windows are very thick, so it\u2019s quite difficult to break them,\u201d said Roncalli of the national fire service.  Making one\u2019s way around without light and where everything is turned on its side can test even the toughest person\u2019s mental makeup. Laird, of the International Underwater Cave Rescue and Recovery group, notes that many cave diver deaths \u201care attributed to panic.\u201d Even those not underwater face situations in which even a small slip-up can be life threatening, he said. Despite such challenges, Roncalli vowed that rescue personnel were prepared and intent on continuing their mission as long as necessary. \u201cThey keep on working until we are sure that no person is missing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe conditions are very tough, but we can manage it.\u201d"

        "content": "The captain of the cruise ship that wrecked off Italy\u2019s western coast will be questioned by authorities Tuesday at a hearing, his attorney said. Francesco Schettino is under arrest and may face charges that include manslaughter, shipwreck, and abandoning a ship when passengers were still on board, according to Italian prosecutor Francesco Verusio. Schettino could face up to 15 years in prison, he said. At the closed hearing, a preliminary investigation judge will decide whether Schettino will remain detained. The captain has not yet been questioned, but more than 100 witnesses, including passengers and crew, have been interviewed, the prosecutor said. The captain\u2019s attorney, Bruno Leporatti, said in a statement Monday that Schettino was \u201cshattered, dismayed, saddened for the loss of lives and strongly disturbed.\u201d But, he said, Schettino is \u201cnonetheless comforted by the fact that he maintained during those moments the necessary lucidity to put in place a difficult emergency maneuver \u2026 bringing the ship to shallow waters.\u201d That move, Leporatti said, saved the lives of many passengers and crew members. Italian prosecutors have ruled out a technical error as the cause of the incident, saying the captain was on the bridge at the time and had made a \u201cgrave error.\u201d Overheard on CNN.com: Worst-case scenario strikes Late Monday, the head of Italy\u2019s coast guard said 29 people remained unaccounted for from the partially sunken cruise ship Costa Concordia \u2013 a sharp spike from earlier estimates of the missing. Coast guard chief Marco Brusco said the whereabouts of four crew members and 25 passengers were unknown, Italy\u2019s ANSA news agency reported. Authorities earlier believed that 16 people were unaccounted for. The Costa Concordia hit rocks Friday night just off Italy\u2019s western coast, leading to what passengers described as a chaotic and surreal scene to evacuate and the deaths of at least six people. On Monday, rescue efforts were ongoing in and around the mammoth vessel, which was listing on its side off the island of Giglio. The search had been suspended earlier in the day because the vessel began to move, said the island\u2019s mayor, Sergio Ortelli. Coast Guard spokesman Filippo Marino said efforts had resumed, adding that rescuers will focus on retrieving the body of a man, presumably a passenger, discovered earlier in the day. However, he said the weather forecast has rescuers worried, as it calls for rising winds. The head of the company that owns the ship said Monday he has not given up hope of finding survivors.  \u201cHope is the last thing to die,\u201d said Costa Cruises chairman and chief executive Pier Luigi Foschi. He addressed journalists at an emotional press conference Monday, apologizing repeatedly for the accident. Prosecutors are examining the ship\u2019s data recorder and expect to have results within days, Verusio said. They are also considering whether others may share responsibility for the crash with the captain. Foschi placed blame for the wreck squarely on the captain, however, saying Schettino had deviated from frequently traveled routes. \u201cThe captain decided to change the route and he went into water that he did not know in advance,\u201d Foschi said. He said the company was limited in its ability to investigate the incident because it did not have the data recorder. Schettino, who has been with Costa since 2002, had never been involved in an accident before, Foschi said. He downplayed the possibility that alcohol may have played a role in the crash, saying he did not believe Schettino drank, and that all crew were subject to random drug and alcohol tests by Costa Cruises. The company had said earlier that Schettino may have made \u201csignificant\u201d errors that led to the wreck. \u201cThe route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore, and the captain\u2019s judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard Costa procedures,\u201d Costa Cruises said in a statement Sunday. The ship had about 2,300 tons of fuel on board at the time of the wreck, Foschi said Monday, adding that so far there was \u201cabsolutely no evidence of fuel leaking into the sea.\u201d Divers have been searching the skyscraper-sized ship, working underwater in pitch blackness, in hopes of finding the missing. There were roughly 4,200 people on the Costa Concordia when it ran aground. Among those unaccounted for were two Americans. The U.S. State Department identified them Monday as Gerald and Barbara Ann Heil. The U.S. Embassy has requested information from \u201canyone with information\u201d regarding the Heils\u2019 whereabouts, the State Department said. The Heils live in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, according to CNN affiliate WCCO, and have four children and 15 grandchildren. Their daughter, Sarah, told CBS Radio in Chicago that the couple was planning to travel after retiring, WCCO said. The disaster\u2019s impact on earnings will cost the ship\u2019s owner at least $85 million to $95 million in the fiscal year to November, parent company Carnival Corporation said Monday \u2013 not including \u201cother costs to the business that are not possible to determine at this time.\u201d Foschi said passengers would get \u201cmaterial compensation for their loss,\u201d but declined to go into details. The ship is expected to be out of service \u201cfor the remainder of the current fiscal year if not longer,\u201d the company said. Schettino joined Costa Cruises as a safety officer in 2002 before being appointed captain four years later, the company said. Even with its admission that mistakes were made, the Genoa-based cruise company defended the ship\u2019s crew in the face of criticism on the part of some passengers, who said the crew appeared helpless and overwhelmed as passengers rushed for lifeboats. \u201cIt is becoming clear that the crew of the Costa Concordia acted bravely and swiftly to help evacuate more than 4,000 individuals during a very challenging situation,\u201d the company said, adding all crew members are trained and the passengers earlier took part in an evacuation drill. Survivors have described the scene \u2013 after the ship hit rocks near Giglio, off the coast of Tuscany, and turned over on its side \u2013 as chaos. \u201cThere was no one taking command,\u201d passenger Lauren Moore told HLN\u2019s Mike Galanos. She said she was having dinner with a group of friends when she heard the crunch of the ship hitting the rock and the crash of plates and glasses falling to the floor. \u201cIt was a terrifying sound and we knew it wasn\u2019t normal,\u201d she said. Moore ran to her cabin and then to board a lifeboat. \u201cIt was so chaotic \u2026 Everyone was basically fighting for his or her own life,\u201d she said. Some passengers braved the chilly water, with a temperature of about 57 degrees, and swam to safety. Others had no choice and fell in. Nighttime temperatures on Giglio have recently dipped below freezing. Authorities have said at least 20 people were injured, in addition to those killed and missing. There were fears the death toll could rise as rescuers searched the ship, which was nearly 50% submerged and had a gash in its hull, authorities said. Questions and criticism continue about what caused the shipwreck and the adequacy of the response. Speaking on Italian television, the ship\u2019s captain insisted the rocks that the Concordia hit were not marked on his map. \u201cOn the nautical chart, it was marked just as water,\u201d Schettino said, adding that the ship was about 328 yards (300 meters) from shore. But Coast Guard spokesman Cosimo Nicastro insisted that the waters where the ship ran aground were well-mapped. Local fishermen say the island coast of Giglio is known for its rocky sea floor. Nicastro said the Coast Guard was investigating why the ship took the course it did. \u201cWe know where the ship was,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know it was too close to the island. \u2026 We don\u2019t know why.\u201d Built in 2006, the Concordia had been on a Mediterranean cruise from Rome with stops in Savona, Marseille, Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca, Cagliari and Palermo. The ship was carrying about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members when it ran aground. The dead include two elderly people found Sunday, two French tourists and a crew member from Peru, port authorities in Livorno said. One of the victims was a 65-year-old woman who died of a heart attack, authorities said. The Spanish Foreign Ministry named one of the victims Monday as Guillermo Gual Buades, 68, saying his family had identified him."

Top seed Wozniacki looked in good shape as she wrapped up victory against the Russia-born Australian in 76 minutes, but the Dane admitted she was worried about a wrist injury she suffered during last week\u2019s quarterfinal defeat at the Sydney International. \u201cI was a bit nervous before the match. I didn\u2019t know exactly what to expect. But it feels better,\u201d the 21-year-old told the WTA Tour website. \u201cI\u2019m very happy about the way I felt out there today. I got into the rhythm as the match went on tonight.\u201d Who will be the 2012 Australian Open victors? Wozniacki will next play Georgia\u2019s 83rd-ranked Anna Tatishvili, who beat Australia\u2019s Ashleigh Barty 6-2 7-6 (7-4).  Former No. 1 Clijsters made a strong start to the defense of her crown with a 7-5 6-1 defeat of Portuguese qualifier Maria Joao Koehler. The Belgian 11th seed, who will play France\u2019s world No. 98 Stephanie Foretz Gacon in the last 64, showed little sign of the hip injury which forced her out of the Brisbane International 10 days ago. \u201cI wanted to go out there and I wanted to start playing,\u201d the 28-year-old told the tournament\u2019s official website.  \u201cI\u2019ve had that ever since we came to Australia.  \u201cI had a good off-season where we worked obviously to try to be in good shape for Australia, then you want to put that to the test and play those matches again.\u201d Clijsters is on course for a fourth-round rematch with Chinese fifth seed Li, who eased through by beating Kazakhstan\u2019s world No. 40 Ksenia Pervak 6-3 6-1. Li, who became Asia\u2019s first grand slam singles champion with her French Open triumph last year, struggled to handle the intense heat on court but emerged victorious to set up a clash with Australia\u2019s 168th-ranked 20-year-old Olivia Rogowska. \u201cI was feeling at end of the first set really hot on the court.,\u201d she said.  \u201cAlso I was feeling no air.  I couldn\u2019t breathe.\u201d  Third seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus is through after an impressive 6-1 6-0 victory over Heather Watson of Britain in the opening match of the tournament.  The victory continued Azarenka\u2019s fine form coming into the tournament, having beaten Li in the final of the Sydney International on Friday. Her next opponent is Australia\u2019s Casey Dellacqua, who beat Serbia\u2019s Bojana Jovanovski 6-3 6-2. Eighth seed Agnieszka Radwanska, a quarterfinalist in 2011, came from behind to eliminate American Bethanie Mattek-Sands.  The Pole\u2019s reward for a 6-7 (10-12) 6-4 6-2 success is a match with Argentine qualifier Paula Ormaechea, who claimed the first WTA Tour level match win of her career by beating 50th-ranked Romanian Simona Halep 6-1 3-6 7-5.  Italian 10th seed Francesca Schiavone also booked her place in the next round. The 2010 French Open champion disposed of Spain\u2019s world No. 72 Laura Pous-Tio 6-1 6-3, and will next play Romina Oprandi. But their compatriot Flavia Pennetta made a shock early exit as the 19th seed lost 6-3 1-6 6-2 against Russian qualifier Nina Bratchikova. China\u2019s 16th seed Peng Shuai is safely through thanks to a 6-3 6-4 win against world No. 120 Aravane Rezai. Peng will next play the Czech Republic\u2019s Iveta Benesova, who beat Rezai\u2019s fellow Frenchwoman Mathilde Johansson 6-3 2-6 6-4. Former world No. 1 and 13th seed Jelena Jankovic progressed with a 6-2 6-0 demolition of Laura Robson, who was one of five British players to be eliminated in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s draws. American Christina McHale earned a surprise 6-2 6-4 win over Czech 24th seed and 2007 Australian Open quarterfinal Lucie Safarova.  Belgian 28th seed Yanina Wickmayer, who won the the Hobart International title last week, lost 7-5 6-2 to Kazakhstan\u2019s 62nd-ranked Galina Voskoboeva. Spanish 26th seed Anabel Medina Garrigues went through 6-3 6-3 against Czech Eva Birnerova, while Slovakian 20th seed Daniela Hantuchova recovering from dropping the opening set to Uzbekistan-born American Varvara Lepchenko to win 4-6 6-3 6-2. German 22nd seed Julia Gorges also progressed along with Romania\u2019s No. 31 Monica Niculescu and Czech No. 32 Petra Cetkovska."

        "content": "Diego Milito scored the only goal as Inter beat Milan 1-0 in the San Siro derby, a result that threw open the Italian Serie A title race after the top three teams all failed to win on Sunday. After leaders Juventus and third-placed Udinese both struggled in earlier matches, defending champions Milan knew victory over their city rivals in the evening kick-off would send them two points clear at the top of the table. And Milan nearly took the lead on the stroke of halftime when Mark van Bommel\u2019s strike crashed against the crossbar with goalkeeper Julio Cesar well beaten.  Who are football\u2019s top January transfer targets? Inter made the most of that stroke of good fortune and Argentine forward Milito scored the only goal nine minutes after the break. Milan defender Ignazio Abate slipped as he attempted to clear Javier Zanetti\u2019s cross and Milito was on hand to stroke the ball home. Inter\u2019s victory consolidated fifth place, but just six points separate the top five teams after 18 games.   The defeat left Milan a point behind Juventus, who remained top and unbeaten after a 1-1 draw at home to mid-table Cagliari. A superb team move resulted in striker Mirko Vucinic tapping home the opener for Juve after just seven minutes, but the Sardinian visitors leveled early in the second half through Andrea Cossu\u2019s long-range strike.  Udinese dropped two points behind Milan after slipping to a 3-2 defeat at Genoa. Damiano Ferronetti headed Udinese into the lead but quick-fire goals from Andreas Granqvist and Bosko Jankovic gave Genoa the advantage early in the second half. Rodrigo Palacio added a third before Antonio Di Natale pulled a goal back from the penalty spot after  Genoa captain Marco Rossi had been sent off. Goals from Brazilian midfielder Hernanes and veteran Germany striker Miroslav Klose gave Lazio a 2-0 home win over Atalanta, putting the Rome club five points behind Juve in fourth position."

        "content": "The disaster that wrecked a luxury cruise liner and killed at least six passengers has left officials and experts on maritime navigation searching for answers \u2013 fast. But two days after the massive ship hit rocks and rolled spectacularly on its side, answers were in short supply. Why was the ship \u2013 with 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members \u2013 so close in to shore in an area where local sailors say the sea bed is pockmarked with rocks?  What happened in the minutes after the ship ran aground?   Why was no \u201cmayday\u201d distress signal sent? Costa Cruises issued a statement saying \u201cpreliminary indications are that there may have been significant human error on the part of the ship\u2019s Master, Captain Francesco Schettino.\u201d \u201cThe route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore, and the captain\u2019s judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard Costa procedures,\u201d the statement added Italian prosecutors announced plans to seize the ship\u2019s data recorders, which some refer to as \u201cblack boxes.\u201d  Authorities hope to complete an analysis revealing what happened within a few days. The ship hit rocks off the coast of Tuscany on Friday, leaving 20 people injured in addition to those killed, authorities said.  According to the Italian Coast Guard, the Costa Concordia was simply too close inland. But what authorities, and the cruise line, can\u2019t answer is why. Capt. Cosimo Nicastro, spokesman for the Italian Coast Guard, said authorities \u201cknow what the cause\u201d was: \u201cThe water went on board.\u201d \u201cWhy he (the captain) went so close is why we are investigating,\u201d Nicastro said. Schettino, who is under arrest, denies the assertion that he had steered the ship too far inland. \u201cWe were about 300 meters (1,000 feet) from the shore, more or less,\u201d Schettino said after the accident. There was a \u201clateral rock projection,\u201d he said.  \u201cEven though we were sailing along the coast with the tourist navigation system, I firmly believe that the rocks were not detected, as the ship was not heading forward but sideways, as if underwater there was this rock projection,\u201d he said. But Nicastro insists \u201cevery danger in this area is on the nautical chart.  This is a place where a lot of people come for diving and sailing. \u2026 all the dangers are known.\u201d Schettino is  facing charges of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship, while passengers were still on board, according to Italy\u2019s ANSA news agency. But, according to ANSA, Schettino says he and his crew were \u201cthe last to abandon ship.\u201d Costa Cruises is owned by Carnival Corporation.  Carnival issued a statement  Saturday saying it was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the \u201cterrible tragedy.\u201d   \u201cWe are working to fully understand the cause of what occurred,\u201d the statement said. Carnival officials did not immediately return a call Sunday from CNN requesting further comment regarding the wreck or the safety of its other cruise lines, such as Carnival Cruise Lines, Holland America and Princess Cruises. Local authorities and residents told CNN they believe that after sustaining damage from what it struck, the ship sailed at least half a mile north, and the captain turned it around toward land, where it toppled.   Experts on cruise-ship safety say there is no way to know immediately what went wrong. \u201cHuman error or navigational error is a real possibility,\u201d said Peter Wild, a cruise industry consultant and former navigating officer.  \u201cThose are the two most likely causes\u201d in general, he said, noting that a combination of the two could be to blame. But there are examples of cruise ships hitting uncharted rocks, he said. Chris McKesson, professor of naval architecture at the University of New Orleans, told CNN that Giglio, where the Costa Concordia wreck took place,  \u201cis probably pretty well-charted.  The Mediterranean has been traveled for some thousand years.\u201d \u201cLooking at the pictures of the damage, it almost looks as if they saw it at the last minute, and they tried to swing the ship to the right to miss\u2026  But just like when you\u2019re driving an RV or something, when you swing the nose to the right, the tail swings little to the left. If you look at the photos of the ship, you can see that the rock embedded in the side of the ship\u2019s left port side\u2026as if exactly that happened. She swung her tail over and kissed that rock.\u201d Cruise ships that travel on international voyages, include the Costa Concordia, are subject to the regulations of the International Maritime Organization, a U.N. agency.  \u201cPassenger ships in operation today are subject to a vast array of regulations and standards covering every aspect of ship construction and operation,\u201d the IMO website says.  \u201cA number of incidents over the years have led to improvements in safety requirements,\u201d the site adds. Costa Cruises, in its statement Sunday, said it \u201ccomplies very strictly with all safety regulations and our personnel are committed, first and foremost, to guest safety and security..\u201d  All crew members are trained in basic safety and emergency management, and their skills are tested periodically by Coast Guard authorities, the statement said. Survivors of the wreck, however, described crew members who appeared overwhelmed.  \u201cThere wasn\u2019t anybody to help you,\u201d said passenger Vivian Safer. \u201cI mean, the passengers were loading the lifeboats by themselves.\u201d  The industry association representing cruise lines emphasized Sunday that disasters  are rare. \u201cAny given day in excess of 300,000 people are on board our ships, being safely carried to various locations throughout the world,\u201d said Michael Crye, executive vice president of the Cruise Line International Association.   In general, if something goes wrong and a ship starts to take on water, \u201cYou either take the ship back to a safe port, if it\u2019s possible to do that,\u201d Crye said, or \u201cif the ship is in imminent danger there are procedures and protocols for abandoning ship.\u201d The captain has to make a series of decisions, Crye said.  He could leave the ship, if he delegates certain responsibilities, but the captain is in charge of the safety of the vessel and remains in charge until everyone on board is safe, Crye said. As for a mayday signal, Crye said the captain is required to report to authorities any \u201cmarine casualty,\u201d a term that includes damage to the ship that can compromise its safety and ability to safely return to port.  The captain \u201cis a professional.  He must at that point weigh the risks of taking one course of action vs. another,\u201d Crye said. Taking place 100 years after the sinking of the Titanic, this disaster is \u201cremarkably similar,\u201d McKesson said.  \u201cTitanic similarly grazed an object on her side. In her case, it was an iceberg, and in her case as the water came in, she tore multiple compartments open.. \u201cThe result of that accident in the engineering side was that we rewrote the ways that we design ships, and those bulkheads that separate the compartments run all the way up to the main deck of the ship. So, you can\u2019t get that cascading effect. And we design ships to withstand a certain number of those compartments being breached simultaneously.\u201d Crye agreed that the damage to the Costa Concordia \u201cappears similar to the damage of the Titanic.\u201d  But \u201cthis was a grounding, not an iceberg,\u201d and \u201cin a well-traveled area close to shore \u2013 not in the middle of the ocean.\u201d  It\u2019s too soon to know whether any new regulations are needed to avoid a disaster like this, said Crye.  But, he said, \u201cIf corrected measures are necessary, I can assure you that we, alongside the Italian authorities, will be suggesting those changes be made.\u201d"

        "content": "Arsenal have lost ground in the race for a Champions League place after they were beaten 3-2 at Swansea in a thrilling English Premier League match on Sunday. The visitors started brightly and took a fourth-minute lead when Robin van Persie coolly finished Andrey  Arshavin\u2019s through-pass for his 18th league goal of the season. But Swansea leveled 11 minutes later when Scott Sinclair netted from the penalty spot after Aaron Ramsey was adjudged to have brought down Nathan Dyer. Who are football\u2019s top January transfer targets? Swansea took the lead for the first time in the 57th-minute when Joe Allen dispossessed Ramsey and fed the ball through for Dyer to finish on the right of the area. That was the cue for Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger to bring on Thierry Henry.  The Frenchman had scored the winning goal against Leeds on Monday and, within six minutes of his arrival, Arsenal were level. However, it wasn\u2019t Henry on target this time, but the wearer of his old No.14 shirt Theo Walcott, who raced onto Johan Djourou\u2019s pass to dink the ball over goalkeeper Michel Vorm. But Swansea were not to be denied and, with Arsenal still celebrating their equalizing goal, the home side netted what proved to be the winner. Substitute Gylfi Sigurdsson\u2019s pass pierced the Arsenal defense and, despite being forced wide, Danny Graham took advantage of hesitancy from goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny to net from an acute angle on the right of the area. The result leaves Arsenal still in fifth position, but they are now four points behind fourth-placed Chelsea and only ahead of Newcastle in sixth on goal difference. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand where the referee found the penalty for Swansea, but then defensively we made some mistakes that we should not have done,\u201d  Wenger told reporters. \u201cWhen it was back at 2-2, we knew we could score a third but in the last two games we have made mistakes that are difficult to explain.\u201d Meanwhile, Swansea continue to impress in their first-ever season in the Premier League, and they are now up to 10th place, nine points away from the relegation zone. Sunday\u2019s other match saw Mark Hughes begin his reign as QPR manager with a narrow 1-0 defeat at Newcastle. Leon Best scored the only goal eight minutes before the break to leave the London side still in the bottom three on 17 points."

The Frenchman only had to avoid mechanical trouble to seal his fourth car triumph, having also won the race six times in the motorcycle category. And the Mini driver achieved that aim, coming home 10th on the day, three minutes and 12 seconds behind stage winner Robby Gordon in his Hummer. Does Dakar Rally damage a delicate environment? That result ensured Peterhansel covered the 8,400km-long race from Mar Del Plata in Argentina in a combined time of 38 hours, 54 minutes and 46 seconds. Team-mate Nani Roma was 41:56 back in second place with South African Toyota driver Ginel De  Villiers third at 1.13:25. Peterhansel told the official Dakar website: \u201cWhen you think how hard it is to win a Dakar Rally, it\u2019s incredible that I have been able to win 10 of them. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, I\u2019ve been waiting for five years to win again! To take the victory in South America is a huge relief, it ranks among my best  triumphs.\u201d He added: \u201cMy finest victory will always be my first win in the motorcycle category, but this one has something special to it. \u201cI was starting to doubt myself, to think I was growing too old for this, that I\u2019d lost it or that I wasn\u2019t made for South America \u2013 and in the end everything turned out fine!\u201d Meanwhile, it proved a French double delight with Cyril Despres claiming the motorcycle category after also completing the final stage unscathed. Despres was presented victory on Saturday when rival Marc Coma took a wrong turn and he cemented his fourth title after the final stage was won by Dutchman Pal Ullevalseter. The KTM rider came home 53:20 ahead of  Coma, with Yamaha rider Helder Rodrigues of Portugal in third place at 1.11:17. Despres said: \u201cI always pay attention to detail. I like doing my homework and, in my job, when things go OK you end up winning. \u201cThis is without doubt the toughest Dakar I\u2019ve ever raced in.  All victories are beautiful, but this one is special because it came down to the wire and was decided at the last minute.\u201d He continued: \u201cI\u2019ve done 85 or 90 rallies throughout my life, and this one was the one where I had to fight the hardest.

        "content": "Protesters seeking the ouster of Romanian President Traian Basescu and early elections gathered for a fourth straight day Sunday in a main square of Bucharest, the capital, and 18 other cities in the Eastern European nation. The demonstrations, which included clashes between police and protesters Saturday in University Square that injured 17 people, are the most serious since Basescu\u2019s election in 2004. See images from the protests Some of the hundreds who showed up at the square on Sunday demanded justice and blamed the government and austerity measures for their poor living standards.  \u201cWe have no financial security. My husband and I are retired but we are sharing our modest income with our children because they are jobless,\u201d said Rodica Ganea, who described being asked during hospital visits to pay for \u201cmedicines, syringes, bandages, everything.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Ganea said. Another woman, 64-year-old Marilena Salan, described similar circumstances. \u201cMy kids are university graduates but they are jobless,\u201d Salan said. \u201cThey are forced to break up their families, leave their kids home and go abroad to work. My nephews are growing up without their parents. This is unacceptable.\u201d On Saturday, police fired tear gas to disperse thousands of protesters gathered in University Square to demonstrate against government austerity cuts.  The protesters blocked traffic, waving flags with the centers ripped out to symbolize the 1989 communist revolution. Others carried signs reading \u201cLiberty\u201d and \u201cDown with President Basescu.\u201d Police fired tear gas in an attempt to calm the crowd, and 17 people were hospitalized in the ensuing chaos with 50 fined for disturbing public peace. The injured included a local journalist and five police officers, one severely injured when demonstrators stoned him. The protests broke out Thursday after the resignation of Deputy Health Minister Raed Arafat, an opponent of health care reforms proposed by the government. Facing public pressure, Basescu decided to scrap the reforms Friday, saying he made the decision after realizing that a majority of those in the medical system opposed the change. \u201cThe hospitals don\u2019t want the change, the (doctors) don\u2019t want the change and neither does the emergency health care system,\u201d Basescu said.  Critics had argued that the proposal favored the private health care system by allowing access to government funds while the state-funded system lacks financial aid. The protests follow several unpopular measures taken by the government over the past two years. After receiving a loan of 20 billion euros from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union in 2009, the government cut salaries in the public sector by 25% a year later to enforce austerity measures recommended by the IMF. Prime Minister Emil Boc said on Sunday that a new series of debates on the health care issue will start Monday, with the intention of creating a new health care law. Over the past three days, protesters also held demonstrations in other cities including Cluj, Timisoara, Iasi and Targu Mures."

Madrid came from behind to beat Mallorca 2-1 to go eight points clear on Saturday, and Barcelona looked to be strolling to victory after taking an early two-goal advantage. Xavi, playing in his 400th league game for Barca, opened the scoring in the 10th minute when he followed up after Cesc Fabregas\u2019 shot had struck the post.

        "content": "Hooded youths tossed stones and police fired stun grenades Friday in front of the Greek Parliament as lawmakers faced tough new conditions they must meet before euro zone finance ministers will give them billions of desperately needed euros to bail out the debt-ridden country. Greece needs the euro zone ministers to sign off on a new \u20ac130 billion ($172.6 billion) bailout deal.  As investors in markets around the world nervously watched the Greek Parliament, trade unions began a two day strike to protest the austerity measures the deal would require.  The main Greek party leaders agreed to a last-minute deal Thursday after lengthy negotiations, which was presented to the other 16 eurozone leaders by Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos. But the deal and new conditions imposed by Europe must still be approved by Parliament this weekend. The third member of the governing coalition made clear Friday that it would not support the deal. Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister of Luxembourg and head of the Eurogroup, which brings together euro-area finance ministers, said Thursday that more assurances were needed from Athens before the bailout could be paid out. \u201cDespite the important progress achieved over the last days, we did not yet have all necessary elements on the table to take decisions today,\u201d he said. Three elements must be nailed down, Juncker said. The sweeping reform package agreed to by Greece and the so-called troika, made up of the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, must be approved by Parliament this weekend. Secondly, Greece\u2019s political leaders must pledge that they will continue to implement the measures after elections in April. Finally, Greece must also find a further \u20ac325 million in \u201cstructural expenditure\u201d cuts for 2012, Juncker said. \u201cThese three elements need to be in place before we can take decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cIn short, there is no disbursement before implementation.\u201d Why the Greek Bailout Doesn\u2019t Change Much of Anything In a sign of the wide public unhappiness in Greece over ever deeper cuts and austerity measures, trade unions called a two-day strike starting Friday. Crowds gathered in central Athens for a planned rally in Syntagma Square outside the Greek Parliament building. But the protest largely dispersed as police and hooded youths clashed. The youths smashed pavements and began throwing stones and pieces of marble, as well as launching Molotov cocktails at the police, who responded with stun grenades and teargas. At least one person appeared to be injured in the clashes. Police earlier said about 13,000 people were on the streets of the capital, with that number expected to rise. The city center is closed to traffic. The plan hammered out by the leaders of the PASOK and New Democracy parties is due to be debated in the Greek Parliament and voted upon on Sunday. But the leader of the third member of the coalition government, the right-wing LAOS party, told reporters Friday his party would not back the measures. LAOS, the smallest member of the coalition, holds 16 seats in the 300-seat parliament, while PASOK has 153 and New Democracy 83.  A Cabinet meeting has been called for later Friday, the office of Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said. Former Prime Minister George Papandreou is expected to address lawmakers from his PASOK party later to explain why he is supporting the deal. Antonis Samaras will also address members of his New Democracy party Friday evening. Eurozone dismisses Greek budget deal The eurozone finance ministers are due to meet again next Wednesday, when they will sign the bailout agreement if Greece has met all the conditions required. Greece needs to secure the bailout funds soon to avoid a potential default on a \u20ac14.5 billion bond redemption in March. Juncker voiced confidence that agreement would be reached in the Greek Parliament. But Greece\u2019s lawmakers are likely to struggle to find another \u20ac325 million in cuts, given the short timescale and the painful negotiations that led to the deal reached Thursday. \u201cAfter a long, tough period of negotiations, we have finally a staff level agreement with the troika for (a) new, strong and credible program,\u201d Venizelos said before presenting that deal to euro area finance ministers Thursday in Brussels. Venizelos added that a deal has been reached on the \u201cbasic parameters\u201d of a deal with private sector creditors to write down a portion of the nation\u2019s debt. The agreement, which would result in significant losses for bondholders, is intended to help reduce Greece\u2019s debts to 120% of Gross Domestic Product by 2020, from about 160% currently. The austerity measures are expected to include job and wage cuts, as well as pension reforms and other unpopular moves. Greek labor unions have waged protests against the measures this week and the issue has become politically charged ahead of planned elections in April. Greece, which owes some \u20ac330 billion, has come close to default before. The nation has struggled to follow through on austerity measures and economic reforms that were a condition of its 2010 bailout package. At the same time, the Greek economy has been in recession for years and many analysts warn that additional austerity could make the situation worse. Greece has come under fire recently from top EU officials for the government\u2019s lack of progress on policies aimed at boosting the nation\u2019s economy. \u201cGreece hasn\u2019t done up till now what the IMF has asked it to do,\u201d German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaueble told CNN\u2019s Diana Magnay Wednesday. \u201cNo more promises, now they have to deliver.\u201d"

The appointed Cabinet needed at least 232 votes to be approved.  The new government was expected to be installed in a ceremony Thursday night.  \u201cI hope I will not disappoint anyone. I will fulfill all the promises I have done to the Romanian citizens. I regret that the opposition didn\u2019t vote,\u201d said prime minister-designate Mihai Razvan Ungureanu shortly after the result was announced.     The opposition has boycotted parliamentary sessions since February 1, calling for new elections for a totally fresh start in Romania.  Opposition leaders said they don\u2019t support the incremental step of a new prime minister appointed by President Traian Basescu, and with it a new government.  However, on Thursday, before the vote, opposition Social Democrat leader Victor Ponta said in a speech in Parliament that the opposition coalition is open to dialog with the new government if Parliament approved the new Cabinet.  Furthermore, Ponta said the opposition is willing to support 15 government projects, mainly European, social and anti-corruption ones.  His statement created controversy among the opposition coalition, and the opposition Liberal Party decided to hold a special ad hoc meeting shortly after Ponta\u2019s speech. Liberal opposition leader Crin Antonescu said after the meeting that his party remains against this new government and trusts his coalition partners to hold their position. \u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss those 15 projects with our coalition partners,\u201d Antonescu said. \u201cHowever, I am calling my liberal colleagues and also our coalition partners to keep in mind that we are fighting against Basescu\u2019s regime, no matter how many governments he will create, and we are fighting for people who want another way of ruling this country. \u201d  Romania\u2019s prime minister-designate announced the lineup of his government Wednesday after two days of talks with the ruling coalition. \u201cI expect competence, professionalism, responsibility, decency, modesty and openness for dialogue. I call the opposition coalition to support this new government because we are together responsible for this country,\u201d Ungureanu said. He replaced all the Democrat-Liberal Party ministers with other members of the same party, but the other two ruling parties retained control of the same ministries they\u2019d had under the previous administration. Ungureanu, 43, was Romania\u2019s foreign minister from 2004 to 2007, and since then has been the head of the eastern European nation\u2019s foreign intelligence service. Ungureanu resigned Wednesday evening from this position.  Former Prime Minister Emil Boc resigned Monday, in the wake of weeks of public protests against austerity measures and pressures from his own party. The resignation made Romania the sixth European country to see a prime minister fall amid the debt crisis sweeping European Union member states. The outgoing prime minister said he prepared his resignation some time ago, but he waited for the International Monetary Fund mission to Bucharest to finish its visit before announcing it publicly. \u201cWe made this decision in order to alleviate the social and political situation in the country, (and) to not lose what Romanians have won with so much suffering \u2013 the country\u2019s economic stability,\u201d said Boc, who had been prime minister since 2008."

        "content": "Home favourite Marion Bartoli recovered from a sluggish opening set to take her place in the last eight of the Paris Open after beating Croatian Petra Martic. The number two seed triumphed 7-5 6-1 on home soil to set up a quarterfinal clash with Roberta Vinci after the Italian beat Bethanie Mattek-Sands 6-3 1-6 6-3. Bartoli struggled in the opening set, committing six double faults on her own serve, but after three breaks in the first eight games, she forced a decisive one at 6-5 and won her own service game. The Frenchwoman hit her stride in the second set, surrendering only one game as she booked a last eight berth. \u201cIt was my first match since the Australian Open, where I really hadn\u2019t played well against Zheng Jie in the third round,\u201d said Bartoli. \u201cI\u2019d left off on a bad match, so it wasn\u2019t easy to get back on the horse. But once I\u2019d won the first set, I started to hit the ball a lot better, which  enabled me to raise my game. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a question of confidence, but it\u2019s never straightforward to come back after two weeks without playing.\u201d Her opponent Vinci, the seventh seed, lost the second set to American qualifier Mattek-Sands but regained her composure to take the decider. Pauline Parmentier\u2019s 6-3 6-0 defeat to German qualifier Mona Barthel means Bartoli is the only French representative left in the tournament. On a good day for the German contingent, ninth seed Angelique Kerber defeated Romania\u2019s Monica Niculescu 6-3 4-6 6-3 to book a clash with top seed and Australian Open finalist Maria Sharapova. At the Pattaya Open in Thailand, defending champion Daniela Hantuchova, from Slovakia, beat Poland\u2019s Urszula Radwanska 6-3 6-2 to reach the quarterfinals. She will face Vania King in the last eight after the American beat Alla Kudryavtseva, from Russia 6-1 6-3. India\u2019s Sania Mirza, a finalilst in 2009, beat Britain\u2019s Anne Keothavong 6-4 7-5 to set up a clash with Hsieh Su-Wei after the Chinese beat Japan\u2019s Kimiko Date-Krumm 7-5 6-0."

The 27-year-old fired seven birdies on the back nine to give him a two-shot lead over the rest of a field, which includes world No. 2 Lee Westwood and No. 3 Rory McIlroy, the 2011 U.S. Open champion. Germany\u2019s Marcel Siem and Scott Jamieson, from Scotland, were on the heels of Cabrera-Bello on seven under, with a clutch of players including McIlroy and Germany\u2019s world No. 4 Martin Kaymer on six under. At one stage Cabrera-Bello was on course for a round under 60, a feat that has never been achieved on the European Tour, but the 2009 Dubai champion missed out by four shots. Tiger Woods: I feel explosive again \u201cJust for a second after the birdie on number two (his 11th hole) I tried to do the maths on what I needed for 59,\u201d the world No. 119 told the European Tour\u2019s official website. \u201cThen I told myself to stop being foolish and don\u2019t be too greedy.

        "content": "Spain\u2019s best-known judge will be suspended for 11 years from the bench after his conviction Thursday for improperly ordering wiretaps while investigating a financial corruption case, the nation\u2019s Supreme Court ruled. Afterward, Baltasar Garzon said he \u201crejects\u201d the sentence, that the court convicted him in \u201can unjust and predetermined manner,\u201d and he vowed to appeal. In a statement late Thursday, Garzon said, \u201cThis sentence, without judicial reason nor evidence to support it, eliminates all possibility to investigate corruption and related crimes by opening spaces of impunity, and seriously contributing \u2013 in an effort to stop one specific judge \u2013 to reduced independence for Spanish judges.\u201d Garzon had ordered wiretaps against suspects who were in jail and under investigation in the case, allowing authorities to listen in on their conversations with defense attorneys and others. Their lawyers later filed a lawsuit, arguing that the wiretapping violated their constitutional right of attorney-client privilege. A seven-judge panel at the Supreme Court convicted Garzon, according to court documents. A second trial against Garzon ended on Wednesday, but judges have not yet ruled in the case. That case concerns his investigation of human rights abuses under the former dictatorship of Francisco Franco in Spain. Human rights groups say both cases, especially the second one, amount to a vendetta against Garzon, who became known internationally for his investigation into human rights abuses under former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. Garzon, 56, was suspended provisionally from the bench in 2010, pending these trials. A third case is under investigation, but no trial has been set. At a three-day trial last month in the financial corruption case, Garzon professed innocence. The case implicated some leading conservative politicians, among others, and there have been trials recently against defendants in the corruption scandal known as Gurtel. Garzon said his wiretap orders, in early 2009, were backed by state prosecutors, who did not bring charges against Garzon. He testified that he ordered the wiretaps on suspicion that suspects in the case were involved in money laundering while they were in preventative prison. But the Supreme Court judges wrote, \u201cThe central question to be resolved in this case is related to the fundamental right of defense for the suspect, against the legitimate interest of the State to pursue crimes,\u201d the sentence said. \u201cIt is not possible to have a just process if the right of defense is essentially eliminated.\u201d The sentence added that Garzon\u2019s investigation had the effect of \u201cadmitting practices which now are found only in totalitarian regimes where anything is considered valid to obtain the desired information.\u201d Garzon\u2019s possible avenues for appeal include the Constitutional Court \u2013 Spain\u2019s highest court, which rules on constitutional issues \u2013 or to the European Court for Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. Julio Villarrubia, a leader of Spain\u2019s main opposition Socialist Party, said the party \u201crespects\u201d the decision of the court but finds it \u201ctroubling that Judge Garzon, who has fought tirelessly against drug trafficking, terrorism and corruption,\u201d is now convicted. Human rights groups consider the second case against Garzon, for his investigation of mass graves under Franco\u2019s rule, to be the more important one. In the second trial, state prosecutors again did not press charges, but a private prosecution, allowed under Spanish law, did. It is led by a small civil servants union called Manos Limpias, or Clean Hands, which charged that Garzon ignored an amnesty law approved in the Spanish Parliament in 1977, two years after Franco\u2019s death. In that trial, which ended Wednesday \u2013 just hours before his conviction in the corruption investigation \u2013 Garzon testified that he searched but could not find any national census of how many people disappeared or their identities. So he decided to investigate because he considered those to be \u201cpermanent crimes\u201d which still affect their descendants, since the remains have never been found. He said he began to see evidence that there was a \u201csystematic plan\u201d against Franco\u2019s opponents, which he said included forced disappearances, illegal detentions and assassinations. Franco\u2019s military uprising in 1936 triggered the three-year Spanish Civil War. The war ended when Franco\u2019s forces defeated Republican and leftist fighters. Franco\u2019s dictatorship continued until his death. Mass graves from the regime are still being unearthed, said Emilio Silva, from a group called Historical Memory. Various international observers attended the trial and Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday, \u201cThis is a trial that should never have been held, but which at least served to show that Garzon acted in accordance with international law, which imposes on states a duty to investigate the worst international crimes.\u201d \u201cThe Supreme Court should put an end to this sorry episode for Spanish justice by acquitting judge Garzon of all the charges against him,\u201d Brody added. \u201cInvestigating state killings and \u2018disappearances\u2019 should never be considered a crime.\u201d Since his suspension in 2010, Garzon has been working as a legal adviser outside of Spain on human rights cases and judicial issues, including in Latin America."

        "content": "Voice mails left by Paul McCartney for his then-girlfriend Heather Mills were illegally accessed and heard by a former employee of a major British newspaper group, Mills told an independent investigation into press ethics Thursday. The former Beatle left about 25 messages for her one night in 2001, including one where he sang to her, as he tried to make up with her after a quarrel, she said. \u201cOne of them said, \u2018Please forgive me,\u2019 and he sang a little ditty of one of his songs onto the voice mail,\u201d said Mills. The former Trinity Mirror group employee later phoned her and said he had heard her voice mail. She responded angrily, she testified before the Leveson Inquiry, saying there was no way he could have heard the message unless he had obtained it illegally.  Mills said the man laughed, and she said she told him: \u201cI promise you, if you report this story, even if it\u2019s true, you have obtained the information illegally, and I will do something about it.\u201d \u201cAnd he never reported the story,\u201d she added. The inquiry is not releasing the name of the person who heard the message because he is under police investigation, said Robert Jay, the chief counsel to the Inquiry. But it was not a Daily Mirror journalist or anyone working under the supervision of its then-editor, Piers Morgan, Jay said. Morgan now hosts a CNN talk show, \u201cPiers Morgan Tonight.\u201d  The voice mail in question was a critical point when Morgan testified in December before the Leveson Inquiry. The probe was set up in response to widespread anger in Britain at the revelation that a murdered 13-year-old girl\u2019s phone was hacked by journalists in search of stories \u2013 and that many other crime and terror victims, politicians and celebrities had also been targeted.  Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News of the World tabloid has been the focus of much of the anger, and Murdoch\u2019s son James ordered it shut down over the scandal.  But accusations have been leveled against other newspapers as well, including the Daily Mirror. Testifying in December, Morgan said he did not believe phone hacking had taken place when he was editor of the tabloid, prompting Jay to follow up: \u201cYou don\u2019t believe so or you are sure?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe so,\u201d Morgan responded by video link. Jay pressed Morgan particularly hard about his having written in 2006 that he had heard a message McCartney left for Mills, trying to make up after a quarrel and singing to her. Morgan refused to say who played the message for him or where, but he admitted under sustained questioning that he believed it was a voice mail. \u201cDid you know that was unethical?\u201d Jay demanded. \u201cNot unethical, no. It doesn\u2019t necessarily follow that it was unethical,\u201d Morgan said, insisting he would not \u201cgo down a trail that will lead to the identification of a source.\u201d On Thursday, Mills said she had never authorized Morgan to access her voice mail or to listen to a recording of it.  \u201cNever, ever,\u201d she said. She said she had never made a recording of any of the messages. \u201cNo, no. They were deleted pretty much straight away,\u201d she said. Brian Leveson, the judge leading the inquiry, intervened to ask if she had ever authorized anyone to listen to her voice mail. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. Mills and McCartney divorced in 2008. Morgan has said in the past that he has never hacked a voice mail and vigorously denied ever ordering phone hacking. Morgan said Thursday, \u201cI have nothing further to add to the evidence I gave to the Leveson Inquiry.\u201d The publisher of the defunct News of the World paid out hundreds of thousands of pounds Wednesday to settle lawsuits over phone hacking from celebrities and politicians, including former Tony Blair spokesman Alastair Campbell. Piers Morgan is a former editor the News of the World, but left in 1995 \u2013 about seven years before the Milly Dowler hacking \u2013 and went to the Mirror, which he edited until 2004. With Wednesday\u2019s settlements, News Group Newspapers has settled 59 of the 60 lawsuits against it. But former child singing star Charlotte Church, who has testified publicly about the damage phone hacking did to her personal life, has refused to settle. Her case is expected to go to court as soon as this month. In addition to the Leveson Inquiry, police are carrying out three separate investigations into elements of the scandal: phone hacking, e-mail hacking, and police bribery. Two parliamentary committees are also investigating the scandal. Both James and Rupert Murdoch, as well as senior executives at News International, have testified before British lawmakers examining allegations of wrongdoing. There have been 13 arrests in connection with Operation Elveden, the Metropolitan Police investigation into bribery of police officers by journalists.  There have been 17 arrests in relation to Operation Weeting, the phone-hacking inquiry. Three people have been arrested in connection with both investigations. No one has been charged."

        "content": "Expectations are high for Sebastian Vettel this year. And, as Formula One\u2019s youngest double world champion, you might expect some of that success to go to his head. But one of the men who knows him best, and whose job it is to channel the skills that have put Red Bull at the top of elite motorsport, is adamant that he is working with a \u201cgrounded superstar.\u201d Team principal Christian Horner is in no doubt that the 24-year-old German driver, who returned to the wheel in the third day of testing in Spain will continue to be a perfect role model. \u201cHe is a great champion and a great ambassador for the sport,\u201d Horner told F1\u2019s official website. \u201cHe connects to his age group in a fantastic way as he has all the \u2018features\u2019 of a modern-day hero. Can Senna restore the romance to Formula One? \u201cHe is fiercely competitive in the cockpit and very down to earth and approachable outside the car. People see his personality.  \u201cHe is a grounded superstar, if such a thing exists. That\u2019s why his popularity has mushroomed so much over the last few years.\u201d The Red Bull Racing name is now established as F1\u2019s dominant force despite this year being just the Austrian-owned team\u2019s eighth in the sport.  Horner is pleased with the rapid progress the Britain-based marque has made, and challenged the team to carry their championship-winning form into 2012. \u201c2011 was an incredible year for the team and it is amazing what we have achieved,\u201d he said.  \u201cDefending both world titles obviously raises the bar again for 2012, and of course our goal and objective is to defend both trophies again. They look perfect on the shelf in our factory. \u201cRed Bull Racing hasn\u2019t been in F1 long, which means that we are competing with teams with some phenomenal history and a lot of knowledge to fall back on. So we are taking nothing for granted.\u201d Horner anticipates a full-blooded battle for the drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 titles this season, which starts with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on March 18. British team McLaren boast world champions in Lewis Hamilton (2008) and Jenson Button, who triumphed the following year with Brawn GP and was runner-up last season. Legendary Italian marque Ferrari, who have won a record 16 constructors\u2019 titles, will be led by Spanish two-time world champion Fernando Alonso. \u201cWe know that McLaren is always a strong team,\u201d Horner said. \u201cThey have two great drivers so they definitely will be pushing very hard.  \u201cFernando Alonso and Ferrari will also be strong opponents. So yes, they will be the usual suspects.\u201d"

The Football Money League shows that the combined revenue of Europe\u2019s top soccer clubs was \u20ac4.4 billion ($5.8 billion) for the 2010-11 season, a 3% rise on the previous year. Spanish giants Real Madrid have been named Europe\u2019s highest-earning club for the seventh year in a row.  The nine-time European champions\u2019 revenue of \u20ac479.5 million ($635 million) is an increase on \u20ac438.6 million for 2009-10. Real\u2019s archrivals and reigning Spanish and European champions Barcelona were second on the 20-club list with a revenue of \u20ac450.7 million ($597 million).  The Madrid giants are closing in on Manchester United\u2019s record of topping the list for eight consecutive years. The top six clubs in the money league have remained the same for the fourth year in a row. \u201cContinued growth of the top 20 clubs during 2010-11 emphasizes the strength of football\u2019s top clubs, especially in these tough economic times,\u201d Deloitte partner Dan Jones said.  \u201cWhilst revenue growth has slowed from 8% in 2009-10 to 3% in 2010-11, their large and loyal supporter bases, ability to drive strong broadcast audiences and continuing attraction to corporate partners has made them relatively resilient to the economic downturn.\u201d England boasted the most teams in the list with a total of six. Premier League champions United were third on the list, having generated \u20ac367 million ($486 million), up from \u20ac349.8 million. The London duo of Arsenal and Chelsea were fifth and sixth on the list respectively.  Arsene Wenger\u2019s Arsenal boasted a revenue of \u20ac251.1 million ($332 million), down on last year\u2019s figure of \u20ac274.1 million. Chelsea, backed by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, saw revenue fall from \u20ac255.9 million in 2009-10 to \u20ac249.8 million ($330 million).

Four-time European champions Bayern Munich were the leading German club on the list in fourth place having generated \u20ac321.4 million ($425 million) \u2013 a small decrease on the previous period.

        "content": "Football fans could find themselves sitting in seats made from sugar when Brazil hosts the FIFA World Cup for the first time in 64 years. Brazil has long led the way when it comes to soccer skills, and the country has also shown considerable innovation in developing new technologies. The two worlds may meet in 2014 as one of South America\u2019s biggest chemical companies hopes to show the way forward with its eco stadium solutions. \u201cWhat we are doing here is showing the world that we have an alternative. You can produce plastics from a renewable source,\u201d says Fabio Carneiro, Braskem\u2019s commercial director for renewable business. Sugarcane is an abundant crop in Brazil, and the firm hopes that it will provide a competitive edge over its renewable energy rivals. As well as biofuel, it is used to make green plastic \u2013 derived from plant sources rather than carbon fossil fuels such as oil. A landmark deal has already been struck with Amsterdam ArenA, the home of Ajax football club, to first install 2,000 such \u201csugar seats\u201d and eventually replace all 54,000 of the existing ones in the Dutch stadium. \u201cThis technology is not really new, it\u2019s a technology from the 1970s,\u201d explains Braskem\u2019s corporate marketing director Frank Alcantara.  \u201cWe had, at that time, a lack of ethylene. We developed this kind of technology to develop ethylene from ethanol. This new technology that we are using now was developed about six years ago. We started producing on a commercial basis since last year in September.\u201d The plant in Triunfo in the southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul is the first in the world to produce ethylene from ethanol and then create green polyethylene, Alcantara says. At this stage it makes up a small proportion of the company\u2019s total output, but \u2013 with 12 stadiums still being built or refurbished \u2013 the World Cup could provide the perfect stage to spur significant expansion. \u201cWe are talking to the people that build the arenas. We want to have the solution in Brazil that we can have sugar seats made from 100% Brazilian sugarcane. It would be very, very nice for everybody,\u201d Alcantara says. The Amsterdam ArenA group has a partnership with Braskem\u2019s parent company Odebrecht and the multinational Petrobras to develop the renovated Fonte Nova stadium in Bahia state for the World Cup. ArenA chief executive Henk Markerink believes the sugar seats could feature at the tournament as Brazil\u2019s national team seeks a record-extending sixth title and first since 2002. \u201cThere\u2019s a high probability to do so. The ethanol is a real Brazilian product, and the resources are available in Brazil,\u201d he says.  \u201cThis will be a very interesting product for World Cup stadiums. Because it\u2019s a Brazilian product I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be supported on the Brazilian side. We hope this product will be pushed as much as possible.\u201d The Dutch group is also working on the new Arena das Dunas venue in the northern city of Natal, which will have an extra year to be completed as it will not be used for the 2013 Confederations Cup event which will also be held in Brazil. While Amsterdam ArenA has the goal of being the world\u2019s first carbon-neutral venue by 2015, the Brazilian stadiums did not have the same sustainability aims inbuilt when football\u2019s ruling body FIFA awarded the tournament in 2007.  \u201cBut we are trying to get as many elements into those stadiums. One of the things is using rain water in a careful way and also using solar energy as much as possible,\u201d Markerink says.  \u201cThe designs for the World Cup stadiums were from 5-6 years ago and we were not involved then. We are trying to retro-fit these things.\u201d He says the Amsterdam ArenA has made big steps to achieving its goals \u2013 changing to recyclable or reusable materials, negotiating deals to use \u201cwaste\u201d energy from local suppliers and becoming independent in part through solar energy. Talks have begun to purchase two big windmills. \u201cIn a day to day situation we can already provide our own electricity; on match days when we peak in our usage, we have to get energy from the net,\u201d Markerink says. \u201cIn the day we deliver energy to the net.\u201d The ArenA\u2019s model is centered on profitable fulltime operation, meaning the venue is used for concerts and other entertainment events as well as sport. A similar approach is being introduced in Bahia, where the group is showing organizers not just how to build the stadium but also how to run it and sustain it in the long term \u2013 including a deal with the local university to make sure suitable workers will be trained and available. \u201cOne of the concerns always, especially from the government, is that there won\u2019t be any white elephants left after the World Cup, that stadiums won\u2019t be used anymore,\u201d Markerink says.  \u201cWe are focused very much on a user program so that the stadium in every sense has a place in society. This stadium is in a very interesting city with a lot of music and dance and entertainment and shows.\u201d He says Amsterdam\u2019s main challenge now is to reduce patrons\u2019 reliance on cars to get to the arena. This means promoting public transport, and therefore cutting carbon dioxide levels. One such tactic is combined tickets incorporating travel, match entry and dining options. But for Braskem, the big obstacle is convincing stadium contractors  \u2013 the 12 venues are all being built in private-public partnerships with the government \u2013 that green technology is better than traditional means. \u201cThe most important thing with our product is you can put it straight in the processing machines and you don\u2019t need any kind of investment. They don\u2019t have to adapt their machinery,\u201d Carneiro says.  Ever-increasing clearance of Amazon rainforest is a big environmental issue in Brazil, but Alcantara says this is not a problem with sugarcane, which can\u2019t grow properly in such wet climates. \u201cWe still have a lot of land that we can use much better in the way of producing goods,\u201d he says. This has been a landmark year for Braskem\u2019s green arm, with deals agreed with big corporations such as Proctor and Gamble, Danone, Nestle, Tetra Pak and high-end fashion house Chanel. From 2013 Braskem will also be able to produce green polypropylene, which will increase its range of plastics alternatives. In football terms, that could mean deals to provide goal nets \u201cOnce the customer decides and says, \u2018I\u2019m just going to buy renewable material,\u2019 we will have the material and we will be able to produce it more,\u201d Carneiro says.  \u201cWe still have to develop a lot of technology. We are doing it, we are investing a lot to develop this kind of material. It is much more important that the customer decides they want to go towards this material.\u201d Alcantara says the company will continue to push the cause of fossil fuel alternatives. \u201cWe announced we were going to make polyethanol in 2007 and we did it. We have a very risk-taking culture at our company, so we just announced it and we did it. Now we are ready to do much more. We can fulfil that \u2013 it is a market need, a real one.\u201d"

On one recent night, emergency services raced through the streets of the capital, Kiev, in response to a call about a homeless man passed out in the freezing weather. The man got drunk and either fell asleep or dropped unconscious outside, putting him at risk of frostbite.  Vladimir Poddubniy, a passerby, found him, brought him indoors and called for an ambulance. When paramedics arrived, they found the homeless man, who gave his name simply as Kostya, squatting drunk on the floor. His hand was so swollen, he could barely hold his cigarette. Poddubniy said the man was freezing to death, so he brought him inside. \u201cI felt sorry for him. But I also didn\u2019t want to find a body in the morning,\u201d Poddubniy said. Paramedics determined Kostya needed emergency hospital care for frostbite, and helped the intoxicated man to his feet. Kostya was so drunk, he could barely walk down the stairs. iReport: Beauty and danger of Europe\u2019s snow But in a country where the cold has claimed at least 112 lives in the past month \u2013 90% of them alcohol-related, according to the government \u2013 Kostya can consider himself lucky to be alive. About 3,000 people have been hospitalized because of the cold since January 27, officials said. Temperatures remained well below the average Thursday, with the mercury falling to -24 degrees Celsius (-11.2 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of Ukraine. Authorities there have set up an emergency hospital to deal with people suffering from cold-related conditions, and distributed 3,000 emergency relief tents across the country, they said. The tents are heated, and people with nowhere else to go can get hot food and drinks. Dr. Anatoliiy Vershigora, doctor-in-chief at an emergency help station in Kiev, said many of those suffering from frostbite and  hypothermia and some of those who died were alcoholics \u2013 but others had been drinking in the mistaken belief it would help keep them warm. Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kiev, has more than 14,000 homeless people, among the most vulnerable to winter\u2019s bitter chill, authorities said.  \u201cIt is an unfortunate fact that a lot of homeless people are alcoholic or dependent on other substances \u2013 it may be why they are homeless in the first place,\u201d said Joe Lowry, a spokesman for the International Red Cross in Europe.  \u201cAlcohol creates the illusion of being warm, so it\u2019s not surprising that people are drinking and not surprising that they pass out,\u201d he said, adding that this is when hypothermia can occur. \u201cOur approach would be to try to get to these people before they have too much to drink, if we can find them and get them to safety. Obviously, a full belly or hot drinks is far, far better for you than vodka.\u201d Red Cross volunteers have been working with authorities to help distribute warm clothing, boots, hot food and drinks in the Ukraine and elsewhere, Lowry said from Slovakia. But, he added, the people who are most in need of help are often hard to locate. \u201cThese people are outside the normal safety nets, difficult to find, and don\u2019t realize the great danger they are in.\u201d Kiev marked its 25th consecutive day of below-freezing temperatures Thursday. It would normally expect a high of -2 degrees Celsius (28 degrees Fahrenheit) at this time of year, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. And there is little respite in sight for those suffering in the unusual cold. Another surge of frigid air is pushing westward out of Russia into the rest of Europe for the end of the week, with Central and Eastern Europe catching the brunt of the coldest air. The cities of Bucharest, Belgrade and Sarajevo saw their coldest mornings so far this winter Thursday, with temperatures dipping to -24 degrees Celsius (-11.2 degrees Fahrenheit) in the Romanian and Serbian capitals and -19 degrees Celsius (-2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The region can expect below freezing temperatures through the weekend, CNN meteorologist Mari Ramos said. Parts of the Danube River, one of the most important rivers in Europe for commerce, have nearly frozen over for the first time in 25 years, showing not only the intensity of the cold snap, but also its longevity. At least four countries have halted shipping along sections of the 1,700 mile-long waterway because of the risk of damage to vessels\u2019 hulls, Ramos said, adding that the river is not only used for transport but for drinking water, irrigation and tourism. Areas along the Black Sea coast have also frozen over, she added. Western Europe can also expect more cold as the week ends, with snow forecast in many parts of England and Wales overnight Thursday to Friday. The sustained cold spell is putting a strain on power providers across the region. Germany announced Wednesday it would fall back on its energy reserves and restart several fossil-fuel power stations that have been dormant for some time. A combination of below freezing temperatures, insufficient yields from renewable energy sources, and interruptions to natural gas imports from Russia have aggravated a discrepancy in energy production left behind by Berlin\u2019s decision last year to rid Germany of nuclear power.  Germany decided to phase out all nuclear energy in the wake of the meltdown at Japan\u2019s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, triggered by an earthquake and tsunami. A spokeswoman from Germany\u2019s Federal Network Agency, the government body responsible for the country\u2019s electricity and gas infrastructure, said that when eight nuclear reactors were taken off line last year, the ability of Germany\u2019s four network providers to compensate for unexpected interruptions in service was affected. The energy supply situation is especially tense in the south because that is where much of the country\u2019s industry is concentrated, she added. The cold snap has raised questions over Europe\u2019s reliance on Russia for gas as supplies sent via Ukraine have dipped below the expected levels. Ukrainian Energy Minister Yuri Boyko said electricity consumption in the country is historically high. But in an interview with CNN, he rejected suggestions that Ukraine has been siphoning off gas as it transits from Russia to Europe. Gazprom, Russia\u2019s gas monopoly, has denied sending lower volumes of gas to Europe. At least 250 people have died across the region in the cold weather."

        "content": "Nine men were jailed in London Thursday on terror charges, four of them over \u201can al Qaeda-inspired plot\u201d to bomb the London Stock Exchange, UK police said. Abdul Malik Miah, Gurukanth Desai, Shah Mohammed Lutfar Rahman and Mohammed Moksudur Rahman Chowdhury had pleaded guilty last week to the London Stock Exchange plot, police said. Five others, Abdul Bosher Mohammed Shahjahan, Mohibur Rahman, Nazam Hussain, Omar Sharif Latif and Usman Khan, also admitted terror offenses, police said. All nine were sentenced at Woolwich Crown Court Thursday to terms ranging from five to nearly 17 years, with some given indeterminate sentences with at least eight years to serve. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Osborne, the senior national coordinator for counterterrorism, issued a statement saying: \u201cThis was one of the most significant and complex counter terrorism operations of recent years. \u201cWe had a network of highly dangerous men based in three cities who were working together to plan terrorist attacks in the UK. \u201cHad we not taken action to disrupt this network, their actions could have resulted in serious casualties or fatalities.\u201d Miah, who had previous convictions, was sentenced to 16 years and 10 months in jail, while Desai was jailed for 12 years, and Latif for 10 years and four months. Shahjahan, Khan and Hussain were each handed an indeterminate sentence, with a minimum of eight years to serve. Mohibur Rahman was jailed for five years. Chowdhury was sentenced to 13 years and eight months, and Shah Rahman to 12 years. Osborne said a major covert operation had been put in place to monitor the suspects, who were based in London and Stoke-on-Trent in England and Cardiff in Wales. At the height of the operation, over the 2010 Christmas period, nearly 1,000 police officers and staff were involved, he said in an online statement posted by West Midlands Police. \u201cThese men were arrested when the balance between public safety and gathering evidence meant that we could not run the operation longer,\u201d Osborne said.  \u201cThis plot clearly demonstrates that there are still people living in our communities who are intent on doing us harm. If we are to find them and we are to stop them we must all remain vigilant and aware.\u201d The investigation, which was coordinated by the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, also involved police forces in London, Wales and Staffordshire, and national counterterrorism and security services."

        "content": "Britain\u2019s Prince Harry is now qualified to fly an Apache Attack helicopter in combat, after 18 months of intensive training that included a stint flying above the deserts of California and Arizona, palace and defense officials said. He was also awarded a prize Wednesday as the best co-pilot gunner in his peer group, the Ministry of Defence said \u2013 one of only two prizes given on the course. The qualification means Prince Harry, who is third in line to the British throne, could be deployed on operations once he has gained more flying experience. Col. Neale Moss, commander of the Attack Helicopter Force at Wattisham Station, said the prince and more than 20 fellow students were now \u201cup to the challenge of operating one of the most sophisticated attack helicopters in the world.\u201d The students had to prove they could handle the aircraft in the desert and mountain conditions of Arizona and California, as well as firing its weapons systems in mock combat scenarios. \u201cThe Apache course is extremely challenging teaching and testing students in their flying skills, decision making and mental agility on exercise all over the country and abroad,\u201d Moss said. \u201cThey are assessed continually to ensure that they are up to the challenge of operating one of the most sophisticated attack helicopters in the world. This requires composure, dedication and hard work.\u201d Prince Harry, known as Capt. Wales within the military, will now be assigned to a squadron within 16 Air Assault Brigade, defense officials said, where he will broaden his experience flying Apaches and take part in U.K.-based exercises. The British Army\u2019s Apache helicopter is designed to hunt and destroy armored vehicles and can operate in all weathers, day or night, defense officials say. It has been widely used in operations in Afghanistan and carries weapons including rockets and Hellfire missiles. Prince Harry \u2013 the younger son of Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, and the late Princess Diana \u2013 served on the front line in Afghanistan as a forward air controller and saw combat. But he was withdrawn in February 2008 after news of his deployment broke. His older brother, Prince William, has been deployed to the Falkland Islands in his role as a Royal Air Force search and rescue pilot. As second in line to the throne, he is specifically barred from combat."

        "content": "With 20 million extra trips on public transport expected during the London 2012 Summer Games, companies are experimenting with flexible working to keep employees off the roads and out of the tube, London\u2019s subway system.             Telecom giant O2 completely closed its headquarters Wednesday to see how effectively its 2,500 staff can work from remote locations.        \u201cThe doors are shut and lights turned off at the business\u2019 200,000 square foot office,\u201d O2 said in a news release.             With up to a third of big companies surveyed by the accounting firm Deloitte agreeing to create flexible hours during the games from July 27 to August 12, O2 says it will publish the results in hopes of convincing even more companies to set up flexible plans.             O2 says its own flexible working plan has already lead to the elimination of 550 desks at its headquarters without job losses.             The London 2012 Organizing Committee created a 46 page handout for companies in 2010 with advice on working during the games. With 70% of the events happening outside the core Olympic Park in East London, public transport will also be under strain in West London, Greenwich, Wimbledon, and Wembley.             Organizers expect 80% of the 8 million ticket holders to use the various rail systems, including the tube, during the games.             There will also be an Olympic Route Network where road traffic will be shut off to allow 55,000 athletes, officials and media to get to venues each day.             Companies are being urged to stock pile non-perishable goods, alter delivery times, postpone meetings, change working hours and of course relocate staff where possible.  "

        "content": "Germany is expelling four members of the Syrian Embassy, citing the arrest this week of two men suspected of spying on Syrian opposition groups in Germany, Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement released Thursday.  \u201cAfter the arrest of two persons suspected of spying for Syria, I have ordered the expulsion of four members of the Syrian Embassy in Berlin,\u201d Westerwelle said.  The Syrian ambassador was called to the Foreign Office on Monday where the \u201cGerman government made clear its position to not accept actions against Syrian members of the opposition in Germany,\u201d according to the statement.  The expulsion comes at a critical time for the Syrian government, which is under fire for a brutal crackdown on anti-government demonstrators calling for the end of the regime. Earlier this week, the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (the GCC),  a politically and economically aligned group of countries bordering the Persian Gulf, announced it would expel their Syrian ambassadors and withdraw its Gulf State envoys from Syria. Tunisia also announced plans to expel the Syrian ambassador from Tunis in response to the recent killings in Homs, Syria\u2019s third-largest city that has become a flashpoint in the 11-month long uprising.   In Germany, federal prosecutors announced the arrests of Mahmoud El A., a 47-year-old with German and Lebanese citizenship; and Akram O., a 34-year-old Syrian, who they accused of having \u201csystematically gathered information on Syrian opposition groups in the Federal Republic of Germany for years.\u201d Acting on arrest warrants issued January 31, some 70 federal and state police officers also searched the apartment of six other suspects, prosecutors said. The Berlin Prosecutors\u2019 Office denied any connection between the suspects arrested Tuesday and those involved in an attack on the Syrian opposition activist and Green Party politician Ferhad Ahma in Berlin last December. The Syrian government has been accused of seeking retribution against relatives of Syrian activists working against the al-Assad regime from abroad. The U.S. State Department announced last year that it had received reports that Syrian mission personnel had been conducting video surveillance of people participating in peaceful demonstrations in the United States. Other Syrian activists living abroad have also declined to be named or appear on camera for fear of reprisals against their families at home. In August, a rebel military leader living in exile in Turkey disappeared from a refugee camp and reappeared days later in Syrian government custody. Evidence also suggested that the government carried out reprisal attacks against the man\u2019s family."

        "content": "Russian scientists briefly pierced the two-mile-thick veil over a freshwater lake hidden beneath Antarctica\u2019s ice sheet for millions of years, polar researchers announced Wednesday. Scientists hope samples of Lake Vostok, a body the size of Lake Ontario, will yield signs of previously undiscovered life and new clues about the history of the planet. The lake is believed to have been covered by ice for up to 30 million years. Russian researchers completed the drilling effort Sunday, reaching the lake at a depth of 3,769 meters (2.3 miles) into the ice, the St. Petersburg-based Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute reported.  When the ice above the lake was breached, lake water was sucked up into the bore and froze, the Russians said. That will allow researchers to take samples back to the surface without contaminating the lake below, they said. Columbia University geophysicist Robin Bell said the Antarctic ice sheet has covered the lake for an estimated 15 million to 30 million years. The Russians have been trying to reach Lake Vostok for more than a decade, and the institute said Russian Natural Resources and Ecology Minister Yuri Trutnev was on hand for the final steps. \u201cThey consider it the equivalent of getting to the moon,\u201d Bell told CNN.  The lake\u2019s existence was confirmed in 1996. Earlier drilling by scientists from multiple nations produced ice cores that contain trapped atmospheric gases, which scientists have used to measure changes in the concentration of carbon dioxide over time. Bell said former Vice President Al Gore cited Vostok ice cores in the 2006 documentary \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d about the threat of global climate change. And peering into the long-hidden waters could give scientists a glimpse of primordial life forms never before catalogued.  \u201cEvery place we\u2019ve looked on Earth, we\u2019ve come up with life,\u201d Bell said. \u201cSo it would be kind of surprising if we didn\u2019t find life there.\u201d  The earlier drillings stopped short of the lake, in part because scientists weren\u2019t confident about getting to the water without contaminating it. University of Hawaii oceanography professor David M. Karl said areas of those cores that were near the lake \u2013 accreted ice, or ice derived from the lake itself \u2013 contained a few viable bacteria that became active under incubation. \u201cThere were a very few microorganisms, but in fact there were microorganisms,\u201d said Karl, who found them in a half-meter sample of the accreted ice in the late 1990s. He said that could mean viable microorganisms exist in the lake. It\u2019s also possible nothing is alive there, in part because no sunlight gets to the lake through ice that thick. But fossil microorganisms may be found, and microorganisms could be living off other sources of energy, such as geothermal, he said. \u201cThere also could be living microorganism living off of previously stored energy from sediments,\u201d Karl said. Bell said that to reach the water, the Russians drilled to within about 10 meters (33 feet) of the bottom of the ice, then withdrew the drill bit and used a heat probe to bore the rest of the way. The effort was designed so that when the ice sheet was breached, lake water was drawn upward a short distance.  That water quickly froze, closing off the lake and allowing scientists to take samples without introducing any contaminants, Bell said.  \u201cThe international community has tried to work collaboratively to try to make sure things are done as safely as possible, and it\u2019s in the Russians\u2019 interests to do it right,\u201d she said.

        "content": "Fabio Capello\u2019s successor as manager of England\u2019s national football team could yet be another foreigner, its ruling body confirmed on Thursday. The Football Association had previously indicated that an Englishman would most likely take charge when the Italian was to stand down when his contract was due to expire after the Euro 2012 finals in June and July. However, the 65-year-old\u2019s shock decision to quit on Wednesday, in anger at being left out of the decision to strip John Terry of the England captaincy, has left the FA in limbo. Capello\u2019s assistant Stuart Pearce, who coaches the under-21 team and will be boss of Great Britain\u2019s Olympic side at London 2012, will stand in on a caretaker basis for this month\u2019s friendly with the Netherlands and possibly other matches before the tournament in Poland and Ukraine. The favorite to take over, Harry Redknapp, has a contract with third-placed Premier League side Tottenham and has indicated he will focus on his club duties for the rest of this season. \u201cWe will do this as quickly and sensibly as we can but don\u2019t want to rush the process. We want to do it properly, do it professionally,\u201d FA chairman David Bernstein told reporters on Thursday. \u201cWe will put a shortlist together of key people. We will do it as soon as we can. It will be a major priority for us.\u201d Capello replaced an Englishman, Steve McClaren, after England failed to reach Euro 2008. Despite good form in qualifying matches his team crashed out of the 2010 World Cup in the second round after being thrashed 4-1 by Germany. McClaren\u2019s predecessor was Sweden\u2019s Sven Goran Eriksson, the first non-Englishman to hold the role in his spell from 2001-2006. \u201cNo, he will not definitely be English,\u201d Bernstein said of the next team manager. \u201cClearly there\u2019s a preference for an Englishman. The position hasn\u2019t changed. \u201cThere\u2019s a preference for an English person or a British person but in the end we want the best person. So I\u2019m not prepared to rule out anything at this stage. Clearly an English or British person would have a good start on the matter.\u201d Bernstein insisted that England\u2019s plans for the Euros had not been thrown into disarray. \u201cWe are in very good shape in many ways,\u201d he said. \u201cThe organisational matters for the Euros are in place \u2013 our base camp, training camp and all else. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of time. The squad won\u2019t get together until May so there is time for a new man to get in place and do what he needs to do building up to the competition. I think we\u2019re actually in a much better place than we appear to be.\u201d The issue of Terry\u2019s court case, starting July 9 after the finals when the defender faces charges of racially abusing a black opposing player last October, led to the rift between Capello and the FA according to Bernstein. \u201cWe all believed that the John Terry case would be dealt with in March or April,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it was postponed we were taken by surprise like everybody else was taken by surprise. \u201cThe board made a very quick and unanimous decision regarding the captaincy. I informed Fabio on Thursday evening as soon as the decision had been made. Fabio wasn\u2019t happy but he accepted the board\u2019s authority in the matter. \u201cOn Sunday Fabio conducted an interview with an Italian broadcaster. That caused conjecture and huge public debate and frankly it was an unsatisfactory situation. \u201cWe had a very frank meeting with Fabio. It was very civilized and at the end of it he decided he felt he had to go. I felt when Fabio offered the resignation it was in the interests of the FA and English football.\u201d"

The decision comes following Wednesday\u2019s hour-long meeting between Capello and English Football Association chairman David Bernstein at Wembley Stadium. The meeting came after Capello openly criticized on Italian TV the English FA\u2019s decision to remove John Terry as England captain. Why is the England football team always in a crisis? Chelsea defender Terry is due to stand trial in July, after the Euro 2012 finals finish, on allegations of using racist language against QPR player Anton Ferdinand. In a statement on the FA\u2019s official website, Bernstein said: \u201cI would like to stress that during today\u2019s meeting and throughout his time as England manager, Fabio has conducted himself in an extremely professional manner.  \u201cWe have accepted Fabio\u2019s resignation, agreeing this is the right decision. We would like to thank Fabio for his work with the England team and wish him every success in the future.\u201d Capello had already decided to leave the position after the Euro 2012 finals in Poland and Ukraine this June. However,  England are now searching for a new manager ahead of the tournament, with Harry Redknapp the strong favorite to replace the 65-year-old Italian. In a bizarre twist of fate, the news came on the same day that Tottenham Hotspur manager Redknapp was acquitted of all charges of  alleged tax evasion. Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere, who made his first England appearance under Capello, wrote on Twitter:  \u201cShocked about the news on Fabio Capello. \u201cHe had shown great belief and trust in me, so I can only thank him. He was a massive influence on my career so far and I am sad to see him go.\u201d And England striker Wayne Rooney also tweeted about the news, saying: \u201cGutted Capello has quit. Good guy and top coach. Got to be English to replace him. Harry Redknapp for me.\u201d England\u2019s next match is a friendly international against the Netherlands at Wembley on February 29.

Substitute Emmanuel Mayuka scored the only goal 12 minutes from time as Zambia shocked another one of the title favorites, Ghana. Meanwhile, a superb individual goal from Arsenal striker Gervinho proved enough for Ivory Coast to see off Mali in Gabon\u2019s capital Libreville. World Cup quarterfinalists Ghana, who lost to Egypt in the 2010 African final, squandered a host of chances, missed a penalty and had a player sent off in Bata, Equatorial Guinea. And the Black Stars were made to pay for not taking advantage of their superiority when 20-year-old striker Mayuka fired home from outside the penalty area. Four-times champions Ghana started the match strongly and should have taken an eighth minute lead when Davies Nkausu fouled Kwadwo Asamoah in the area. But Asamoah Gyan wasted the resulting penalty when his poorly-struck spot-kick was pushed  away by goalkeeper  Kennedy Mweene.  Soon afterwards, Gyan shot straight at Mweene after being put through by Andre Ayew, whose younger brother Jordan also fluffed a great chance to score. Ghana continued to have the majority of the possession after the break, but Mayuka\u2019s superb strike gave Zambia a lead they held onto. Ghana\u2019s woes were compounded by the dismissal of Derek Boateng with seven minutes left for a second bookable offense. A contender for the goal of the competition from Arsenal striker Gervinho against Mali put Ivory Coast into the final for the first time since losing to Egypt in 2006. Picking the ball up on the halfway line, Gervinho left a host of Mali players in his wake as he sprinted down the left wing before firing a shot past goalkeeper Soumaila Diakite into the far corner of the net. Looking to avoid the same fate as Ghana earlier in the day, the Elephants nearly took a fifth-minute lead when Didier Drogba\u2019s shot struck the crossbar. And, just seven minutes later, African player of the year Yaya Toure also struck the bar after being set up by Drogba\u2019s Chelsea clubmate Salomon Kalou. Moustapha Yattabare had Mali\u2019s best chance in the 72nd minute, but his attempt from the right narrowly whistled over the crossbar."

Fabregas opened the scoring in the 15th minute when he ran onto Lionel Messi\u2019s pass before lobbing goalkeeper Diego Alves. Valencia were reduced to 10 men in the 76th minute when Sofiane Feghouli received a second yellow card, and Barca made their man advantage count just five minutes later when Fabregas turned provider to set up Xavi for the home side\u2019s second goal. The Catalan giants will now face Athletic Bilbao in the Madrid final, in a clash between the two most successful clubs in the history of the Spanish Cup. Last year\u2019s beaten finalists Barca, who last won the trophy in 2009 against Bilbao, have lifted the cup 25 times, while Bilbao have won it on 23 occasions, although not since 1984. Meanwhile, in Italy, a double strike from Martin Caceres helped Juventus win 2-1 at AC Milan in the first leg of their Italian Cup semifinal at the San Siro. After a goalless first half, Juve took a 53rd-minute lead when Marco Amelia failed to hold Marco Borriello\u2019s shot and  Caceres stroked home the loose ball. However, Milan leveled just nine minutes later when Massimo Ambrosini teed up Stephen El Shaarawy to fire home. Milan looked the likelier side to score, but Juventus broke down the left seven minutes from time, with Emanuele Giaccherini\u2019s cross superbly curled home by Caceres. The result ensures Juve remain unbeaten in league and cup this season and they are now firm favorites to progress to the final where they will play either Siena or Napoli \u2013 who play their first leg on Thursday. Also in Italy, Catania and Roma played out the final 25 minutes of their abandoned Serie A clash but could add not add to the score, with the match finishing 1-1. Originally played on January 15 the game had been called off after 65 minutes due to a waterlogged pitch. In England, Sunderland defeated local rivals Middlesbrough 2-1 in extra time in their FA Cup fourth round replay, and will now host Arsenal in the last 16 later this month. Meanwhile, all four away teams are through to the semifinals of the German Cup, with Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Moenchengladbach and Greuther Fuerth securing their places. The biggest surprise saw second division Greuther Fuerth win 1-0 at Bundesliga side Hoffenheim, with Canadian striker Olivier Occean scoring the only goal.

        "content": "It\u2019s only been done once in tennis history, but world number one Novak Djokovic believes he can win the \u201cgolden slam\u201d \u2013 all four major tournaments plus Olympic gold \u2013 in 2012. Speaking exclusively to CNN\u2019s Pedro Pinto after being named as the Laureus Sportsman of 2011, Djokovic revealed that he was confident of adding this year\u2019s other top tennis prizes to his recent Australian Open success. Only former women\u2019s No. 1 Steffi Graf has achieved the feat, in 1998, but Djokovic already has his sights on winning gold for Serbia in London, as well as retaining his Wimbledon and U.S. Open titles and claiming his first French Open success. \u201cThe Olympic Games is certainly high on my priority list this year,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cI had the privilege of being part of the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and won a bronze medal for my country. \u201cThe difference is that I will be representing my country, rather than myself, and that\u2019s something that I am really looking forward to.\u201d  He added: \u201cObviously it will be a hard task to win the \u2018golden slam\u2019 but the thought excites me. \u201cIt gives me goose bumps and little butterflies in the stomach when I start thinking about the \u2018golden slam.\u2019 You have to consistently be successful to be one of the top players in the world, and everything is possible in life.\u201d  Djokovic also admitted that he is still on a high after his epic five-set victory over Rafael Nadal, in a match being acclaimed as the greatest grand slam final in history. \u201cIt was definitely the most exciting match that I ever played in. It was six hours, against my biggest rival, so we made history that night and unfortunately there had to be only one winner,\u201d the 24-year-old said. \u201cI think the great thing about the whole occasion is that 15,000 people stayed in their seats until 1:30 a.m. and I think 4:30 p.m. was the time that I left to go back to my hotel, so it was quite a long night!\u201d Djokovic\u2019s victory over Nadal means he has now beaten the Spaniard in the last three grand slam finals. However, the Serb still believes his rival is the man to beat once again this year. \u201cRafa is definitely one of the greatest, if not the greatest, competitor there is in tennis history. He never gives up, fights for every point and never gives you an easy unforced error,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cHe is constantly out on the practice courts, wanting to improve, and I think that\u2019s the beauty of men\u2019s tennis at the moment \u2013 we all want to improve and are taking each other onto another level.\u201d "

        "content": "The auctioneer rattled off prices and artists\u2019 names with breathtaking speed, punctuating every sale with the announcement \u201cSaa \u2026 saa \u2026 saa \u2013 TIM!\u201d meaning sold in English. The bidding was fast and sometimes competitive at the Nisantasi Auction House, in one of Istanbul\u2019s most posh neighborhoods. Within an hour, auctioneer Ali Ulukaya sold off more than $300,000 worth of paintings, almost all of them by living Turkish artists. After being virtually ignored for decades, both at home and abroad, Turkish modern art has rapidly developed into a booming market.  \u201cThese numbers have gotten quite astronomical,\u201d said Kerimcan Guleryuz, owner of the recently opened Empire Project art gallery. Guleryuz is the son of Mehmet Guleryuz, one of Turkey\u2019s most famous living painters. \u201cUnfortunately, until five or 10 years ago \u2026 the number of artists I could count who were making a living just off of their work was three to five, maybe,\u201d Kerimcan Guleryuz said. \u201cNow you can look at a work from Taner Ceylan being put in the Sotheby\u2019s auction and reaching more than 280,000 pounds sterling ($444,000).\u201d Just 10 years ago, artist Kezban Arca Batibeki said, she had a hard time explaining her art to Turks. Her loft studio in a rapidly gentrifying Istanbul neighborhood was decorated with large tableaus, one of them featuring a cartoonish, scantily clad woman lying bound, gagged and frightened in the corner of a ruined house. \u201cEverybody asked \u2026 \u2018Is it a painting? Is it an illustration or what?\u2019 I was always trying to explain what I was doing,\u201d she said. Now, Batibeki\u2019s pop-art confections sell for tens of thousands of dollars, mostly to Turkish buyers. \u201cTurkish people like trends,\u201d she said with a smile.  \u201cWhen it became a trendy movement, they began buying contemporary works.\u201d In 2009, Sotheby\u2019s held its first auction of Turkish modern art in London. The auction grossed more than $2 million in sales. The next year, those numbers nearly doubled. Traditionally, wealthy industrialist families have been the biggest art patrons in Turkey. The privately funded Sakip Sabanci Museum opened in Istanbul in 2002. Two years later, the Eczacibasi family launched the Istanbul Museum of Modern Art. Independent collectors, however, have started making inroads. Downtown Istanbul has seen dozens of new art galleries in just the past few years.   \u201cIt\u2019s like mushrooms after rain,\u201d said William Greenwood, a curator at the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, Qatar. Industry insiders say the booming Turkish art market has paralleled the rapid growth in Turkey\u2019s once crisis-prone economy. Since a financial meltdown brought Turkey\u2019s banking sector to its knees in 2001, the economy has stabilized and more than doubled in size the past 10 years. \u201cThe influence of the Turkish economy\u2019s growth has unquestionably been one of the most important catalysts to this growth in the sales of artwork,\u201d gallery owner Guleryuz said. \u201cThey go hand in hand. Unless you have economic stability, unless you have growth, you will not have sales in art. It\u2019s just not possible.\u201d But Turkey\u2019s transformation is not only economical; it is also cultural.  Since its launch in 1987, the Istanbul Biennal Contemporary Art exhibition has introduced many once-skeptical Turks to contemporary art. \u201cThe impact of the Biennal on the Turkish art scene has been immense,\u201d said Susan Platt, art critic and author of \u201cArt and Politics Now.\u201d \u201cThe artists are now exposed to many, many different strategies and media and also artists from all over the world.\u201d Batibeki said her work is now being displayed in a New York gallery after its owner saw her pieces on display in Istanbul\u2019s Biennal. But she conceded that newfound Turkish appreciation of modern art is not what has been driving sales. \u201cVery few of them buy because they love the piece,\u201d she said.  \u201cMost of them are buying because you\u2019re famous.\u201d Guleryuz notices this, too. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to lose track of why it is that we are looking at the art,\u201d he said. \u201cAre we looking at it because it\u2019s worth $150,000 or because it describes something about the human condition?\u201d At the Nisantasi Auction House, Ulukaya said the majority of his buyers were looking for something valuable to invest in. \u201cWe see it as a lucrative business,\u201d said Salime Adali, who came to watch the auction. Adali said that in addition to his iron business, he recently opened an art gallery with his wife in Istanbul. \u201cWe see this as a good investment for our retirement and something to leave our daughter,\u201d he said. And there is one rule to collecting art that still appears to dominate this newfound market.  After a series of landscapes of the Turkish countryside sold for 1,000 lira ($568) a piece, one buyer in the back of the crowded room quipped to his neighbor, \u201cThose paintings will only become valuable after the artist dies.\u201d"

        "content": "Former world No. 1 Tiger Woods is confident he is returning to top form ahead of his first PGA Tour appearance of 2012 at Pebble Beach this week. The American clinched 14 majors between 1997 and 2008, but has struggled with injury over the last two years and has not won an officially sanctioned tournament since November 2009. But Woods has shown signs of improvement in recent months, winning the Chevron World Challenge event he hosts in December and finishing tied for third at last weekend\u2019s Abu Dhabi Golf Championship. The 36-year-old, who has also gone through a high-profile divorce after admitting extramarital affairs, said he is now able to train thoroughly, rather than rehabilitating the leg injuries which have plagued him in recent years. Why golf (and big business) still need Tiger Woods \u201cRehabbing and training are two totally different scenarios,\u201d he told reporters ahead of the AT&T Pebble Beach National, which starts Thursday and offers a winner\u2019s purse of $1.152 million.  \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to train. I haven\u2019t been healthy enough. I\u2019m now training and my body is feeling explosive again. Consequently I\u2019m hitting the ball further.\u201d Woods entered the final round of last week\u2019s European Tour event tied for the lead with eventual winner Robert Rock, but found only two fairways over the last 18 holes and finished two shots behind the Englishman. Despite missing out on victory, Woods was encouraged by his performance in the Gulf. \u201cThat was my bad day and it wasn\u2019t that bad. I know the stats show I only hit two fairways, but I landed the ball on eight and ran through it,\u201d he said. \u201cMy stats said I hit six greens, but I putted from off the green four times so that\u2019s 10 greens. If I can have that as my bad ball-striking day, we\u2019re looking pretty good.\u201d Woods has won a total of 71 PGA Tour events since turning pro in 1996 \u2013 only the legendary duo of Jack Nicklaus with 73 and the late Sam Snead on 82 have claimed more. Now ranked 18th after falling outside the top 50 last year, he admits that practicing and preparing for tournaments gets harder the older he gets. \u201cThe more we age, the more time we need to heal,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t recover quite as well. \u201cI know that I\u2019m sore quite often, just about every day when I\u2019m playing with my kids. I don\u2019t remember ever being like that. I just have to train smarter, practice smarter.\u201d"

        "content": "Romania\u2019s prime minister-designate announced the lineup of his government Wednesday following two days of talks with the ruling coalition. \u201cI expect competence, professionalism, responsibility, decency, modesty and openness for dialogue. I call the opposition coalition to support this new government because we are together responsible for this country,\u201d said Prime Minister Mihai Razvan Ungureanu. The prime minister-designate replaced all the Democrat-Liberal Party ministers with other members of the same party, but the other two ruling parties retained control of the same ministries they\u2019d had under the previous administration. Ungureanu explained that he had appointed young, foreign-educated people to run the ministries because he is confident their experience will help them face any challenge. However, most of the ministers are not familiar to the public. One of the youngest is 38-year-old Democrat-Liberal Lucian Bode, a former power company engineer who was named to be Minister of the Economy.  This post was expected to be run by Democrat-Liberal Andreea Paul Vass, but she declined it following accusations of incompatibility made by party colleague Sulfina Barbu. Ungureanu is expected to announce the government program Thursday in parliament, which must approve his plans so he can officially form a new government. Ruling and opposition lawmakers are expected to express their confidence vote in parliament that day.    If the new government is not approved in the following 60 days, parliament will be dissolved and early elections would be held. Currently, Romania is expected to have a local election in the spring and parliamentary elections in the fall. Former Prime Minister Emil Boc, who resigned Monday but remains the president of the ruling Democrat-Liberal Party, said Wednesday his party will support the new government.  Opposition politicians, who have boycotted parliamentary sessions since February 1, have called for new elections for a totally fresh start in Romania.  They don\u2019t support the incremental step of a new prime minister appointed by President Traian Basescu, and with it a new government. Liberal leader Crin Antonescu signaled that he and other opposition leaders do not plan to back Ungureanu or any new government that might form under him. \u201cWe believe this is an improvised solution by Basescu to keep the current coalition in power, although most Romanians don\u2019t agree with this,\u201d said Antonescu. The opposition met Monday evening with the president to discuss the political situation. Some echoed a sentiment voiced by protesters in recent weeks demanding that, in addition to Boc and his government, Basescu himself resign. \u201cPresident Basescu\u2019s resignation is the only way we could end this political crisis, but he told us that he won\u2019t step down,\u201d Antonescu said. On Monday, Basescu appointed Ungureanu as his pick to be the nation\u2019s next permanent prime minister. The 43-year-old Ungureanu was Romania\u2019s foreign minister from 2004 to 2007, and since then he has been the head of the eastern European nation\u2019s foreign intelligence service. The announcement was made after Boc resigned on Monday, in the wake of weeks of public protests against austerity measures and pressures from his own party.   The resignation makes Romania the sixth European country to see a prime minister fall amid the debt crisis sweeping European Union member states. Announcing his resignation on television, Boc said he is not the kind of person to hang on to power, and that it is time to make space for another government. He admitted making mistakes, but said he is sure Romania has a bright future. The outgoing prime minister said he prepared his resignation some time ago, but he waited for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission to Bucharest to finish its visit before announcing it publicly.  \u201cWe made this decision in order to alleviate the social and political situation in the country, (and) to not lose what Romanians have won with so much suffering \u2013 the country\u2019s economic stability,\u201d said Boc, who had been prime minister since 2008. Protests continued to take place in Romania despite the recent announcements, as hundreds of people called for Basescu to step down and early elections to he held. People also demonstrated against corruption and small state salaries.  Some Romanians blame the government for imposing harsh austerity measures after the country received 20 billion euros from the IMF and the European Union. Protests turned violent January 15, when some of the thousands of people gathered in central Bucharest clashed with police. Stores were vandalized and dozens were wounded. The austerity measures, tensions between protesters and authorities, and political turnover are not unique to Romania. In Europe, there have been months of unrest in Greece, while Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal have also seen changes of government as their leaders try to cut spending in order to stabilize the common, multi-national currency, the euro.

        "content": "The European Aviation Safety Agency has ordered checks for cracks in the wings of the Airbus A380, though it has stopped short of grounding the fleet. CNN examines some key questions about the aircraft and what it means for the passengers, the airlines and the manufacturers. What is the Airbus A380? The jet liner is a double-deck, wide-bodied aircraft made by Airbus \u2013 a subsidiary of the EADS group \u2013 and capable of carrying more than 800 passengers, though it routinely carries far fewer. It made its maiden flight in 2005 and first entered service with Singapore Airlines in 2007. As of January 31, 2012, the company said it had delivered 68 aircraft to customers and had orders for a further 185. Which airlines fly it? The Airbus A380 is currently in service with Air France, China Southern Airlines, Emirates, Korean Air, Lufthansa, Qantas and Singapore Airlines. Airbus says within the first three years of service, about 15 million passengers had flown in the jet. Is there anything distinctive about the airliner? Its potential capacity makes it the largest passenger carrier in the world \u2013 although the Boeing 747-8 is a longer aircraft. David Kaminksi-Morrow, air transport editor of Flight International magazine, says it was developed to compete with the Boeing 747 which had dominated the jumbo airliner market for decades. \u201cApart from its size, the A380 is notable for its quietness,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet both inside and out, and that\u2019s quite an achievement, and spacious. It\u2019s also an efficient aircraft \u2013 it has a low fuel bill per passenger which keeps the airlines and the environmental lobby happy.\u201d Boeing says on its website that the 747-8 will be quieter, produce lower emissions and achieve better fuel economy than any competing jet liner. So what\u2019s the problem with the A380? The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) last month required checks for cracks in the 20 oldest aircraft after faults were found in the wing rib feet \u2013 the bracket that joins the ribs to the wing surface.  It has now expanded the request that carriers carry out inspection and repair on the Airbus A380 before reaching 1300 flight cycles. For aircraft already very close to 1300 flights, a six-week window is being provided so they can plan ahead for their inspection to minimize disruption to their operations. A spokesman for the aviation agency said the planes could still fly, but had to be checked within the time frame, and a long-term fix was being worked on with Airbus.  The original cracks were found as a result of investigations into a separate incident in which a Qantas A380 suffered an engine failure in November 2010. If cracks are found, the airline must contact Airbus for instruction, the safety agency said. Should passengers be worried? Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders told CNN\u2019s Richard Quest last month that the cracks in the wing rib feet were \u201cminor\u201d and that safety was an \u201cabsolute priority.\u201d Kaminski-Morrow also said he didn\u2019t believe safety was an issue, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a structural issue and structural issues have to be investigated but the wing isn\u2019t going to fall off as a result of the problem. EASA could ground the aircraft if it wanted to \u2013 but hasn\u2019t. It\u2019s not categorized as an emergency.\u201d In response to last month\u2019s checks, Enders said: \u201cWhat we have developed already is a repair solution, and this is what we will apply on the various aircraft if and where it is necessary.\u201d He also said the fault was confined to the A380 and confirmed that it was not a wider problem on the Airbus range. What does it mean for Airbus? Enders admitted the fault was embarrassing for Airbus but Kaminski-Morrow described it as more of a \u201cteething problem.\u201d He told CNN Wednesday: \u201cI don\u2019t think this will harm its reputation in the long term. The plane is very reliable and proving to be very popular. I think the airlines will stick with it. It\u2019s selling. The A380 is here to stay.\u201d What about the competition? The rivalry between Airbus and American competitor Boeing is intense. Both companies have accused each other of receiving illegal subsidies and in 2005 both filed complaints with the World Trade Organization.  The wide-bodied Boeing 747-8 was made in response to the A380 to battle for the custom of airlines running long-haul routes, and for freight trade \u2013 and the manufacturers continue to upgrade their designs and improve efficiency.  When the  two models were compared by Flight International in 2006, the magazine concluded: \u201cIt will be another five years at least until it becomes clear who has got it right, but one thing is certain \u2013 the airlines at last have what they always wanted and that is a choice of supplier at the top end of the size spectrum.\u201d "

        "content": "Alcohol has been involved in most of the deaths blamed on the extreme cold in Ukraine, the country worst affected by the icy temperatures gripping Eastern Europe, a government minister said Wednesday. Nine out of 10 of the deaths reported have been alcohol-related, Emergency Situations Minister Viktor Baloga said.  At least 135 deaths have been reported in Ukraine in the past two weeks, but he suggested the actual number that can be blamed on the winter weather is somewhat lower, at 112. About 3,000 people have been hospitalized because of the cold since January 27, officials said. Authorities in Ukraine have set up an emergency hospital to deal with people suffering from cold-related conditions, and distributed 3,000 emergency relief tents across the country, they said. The tents are heated, and people with nowhere else to go can get hot food and drinks. Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kiev, has more than 14,000 homeless people, authorities said. They are among the most vulnerable to winter\u2019s bitter chill. Dr. Anatoliiy Vershigora, doctor-in-chief at an emergency help station in Kiev, told CNN many of those suffering frostbite, hypothermia and in some cases death were alcoholics \u2013 but that others had been drinking in the mistaken belief it would help keep them warm. Outdoor workers, such as those at market stalls, were also suffering frostbite in the extreme conditions, he said, as were some children whose parents had let them spend too long outside. Joe Lowry, a spokesman for the International Red Cross in Europe, said: \u201cIt is an unfortunate fact that a lot of homeless people are alcoholic or dependent on other substances \u2013 it may be why they are homeless in the first place. \u201cAlcohol creates the illusion of being warm, so it\u2019s not surprising that people are drinking and not surprising that they pass out,\u201d he said, adding that this is when hypothermia can occur. \u201cOur approach would be to try to get to these people before they have too much to drink, if we can find them and get them to safety. Obviously, a full belly or hot drinks is far, far better for you than vodka.\u201d Red Cross volunteers have been working with authorities to help distribute warm clothing, boots, hot food and drinks in Ukraine and elsewhere, Lowry said, speaking to CNN from Slovakia. But, he added, the people who are most in need of help are often hard to locate. \u201cThese people are outside the normal safety nets, difficult to find, and don\u2019t realize the great danger they are in.\u201d Dr. Sam Zakhari, director of the Division of Metabolism and Health Effects in the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism at the National Institutes of Health, said consuming alcohol is dangerous in cold weather for two main reasons. One is that alcohol causes the dilation of blood vessels in the skin, which means they are wider and more blood passes through. This makes the person feel hot, which is not an issue if the person is warmly dressed and indoors,  Zakhari said. But \u201cif he or she is not wearing enough warm clothes they will lose heat rapidly, and that can contribute to hypothermia.\u201d Secondly, he said, a person who is inebriated may not have the ability to judge what\u2019s happening or respond appropriately. He or she may slip and fall in the icy conditions and risk becoming unconscious, or fall asleep as alcohol depresses the central nervous system, he said. Zakhari advises those who are inebriated to stay inside for safety, where possible, or if they must be outside to dress in several warm layers to stop heat escaping and try to ward off hypothermia.  Kiev marked its 24th consecutive day of below-freezing temperatures Wednesday, with a low of minus 18 Celsius (minus 0.4 Fahrenheit), CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. It could normally expect a high of minus 2 degrees Celsius at this time of year. And there is little respite in prospect for those suffering in the unusual cold. Another surge of frigid air is pushing westward out of Russia into the rest of Europe for the end of the week, with Central and Eastern Europe catching the brunt of the coldest air, Miller said. Temperatures in some of the hardest hit countries, such as Ukraine, Romania, Hungary and Serbia, will once again drop below average by as much as 15 to 20 degrees Celsius (25 to 35 degrees Fahrenheit). Warsaw, in Poland, which would normally expect a high of 2 degrees Celsius (36 degrees Fahrenheit), has now spent 15 days below freezing, while Sarajevo in Bosnia-Herzegovina has spent 14 days in subzero temperatures, well below the average for this time of year of 5 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit.) Temperatures are likely to remain below average well into next week, at the least, with no significant warming likely until late February, Miller said. Parts of the Danube River, one of the most important rivers in Europe for commerce, have nearly frozen over for the first time in 25 years, showing not only the intensity of this cold snap, but also its longevity. The sustained cold spell is also putting a strain on power providers across the region and has raised questions over Europe\u2019s reliance on Russia for gas, as supplies sent via Ukraine have dipped below the expected levels. Ukrainian Energy Minister Yuri Boyko said electricity consumption in the country is historically high. But in an interview with CNN, he rejected suggestions that Ukraine has been siphoning off gas as it transits from Russia to Europe. Boyko said the main reason for the 30% drop in gas reaching Europe was the extremely cold weather in Russia, which meant a smaller than usual amount of gas entered Ukraine. Instead of Ukraine receiving the expected 500 million cubic meters per day, only 400 million cubic meters came to its western border, he said. Gazprom, Russia\u2019s gas monopoly, has denied sending lower volumes of gas to Europe. But Boyko said he believes the real answer is that given by the deputy chairman of Gazprom, whom he quoted as saying the company was not ready to send additional supplies to Europe during the cold spell. At least 250 people have died across the region during the cold snap. In Romania, where at least 39 people have died because of the weather, snow blown by icy winds on the shores of the Black Sea has disrupted road and rail travel and cut power to 35 settlements in southeast Constanta county, state news agency Agerpres reported Wednesday. Water supplies were also cut to 16 of those settlements. Meanwhile, holiday villas, beaches and resort buildings have been flooded by waves up to 5 meters (16 feet) high swept in from the Black Sea by the winter storms, the news agency said. Video shot by CNNi Reporter Angela Leeb in Constanta on Wednesday showed a fierce snowstorm howling outside her home. It\u2019s \u201cstill very windy and cold but not snowing,\u201d she said. A yacht rides loose on the shore, torn from its moorings by a bad storm last week, she said. As the week started, all \u201cnational roads,\u201d or two-lane highways, in seven counties in the country\u2019s south and east were blocked by snow, Agerpres reported. More than 50 people, most of them homeless, have died in Poland in the past several weeks, according to Polish TVN.  At least 64 people have died because of the cold in Russia, the government in Moscow said. In Hungary, the Red Cross has helped more than 4,000 people this week through 15 homeless centers and door-to-door services in rural settlements. Twelve deaths have been reported there during the cold snap, the Red Cross said in a release. Snow has also fallen as far west as Spain. Snowfall in Europe\u2019s southeast, close to the Mediterranean Sea, has cut off roads and isolated areas from access to supplies. Southeastern Europe will see more heavy snow, while the northeast is predicted to shiver under temperatures much lower than its winter averages, meteorologists said. The German capital, Berlin, has spent nearly two weeks below freezing, whereas it would normally average 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit). In Berlin, CNN iReporter Meghan Nevill said it is too cold to stay outside for longer than 10 minutes. Water at a dam in the city, the Muggelseedamm, has frozen solid, she said. Britain\u2019s Met Office is warning of wintry weather over the next few days, with freezing rain and ice expected Wednesday night across northern England and parts of Scotland. London and portions of eastern England will see some significant snow accumulations by Friday, with up to 10 centimeters (4 inches) in the hardest hit areas and 2 to 4 centimeters possible in the London area, forecasters said. Temperatures in Paris have been below freezing for a week."

        "content": "Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has told CNN that football must eradicate all forms of racism, following recent high-profile incidents in England which have brought the matter back into sharp focus. One of Ferguson\u2019s own players, France left-back Patrice Evra, was at the center of an incident last October which saw Liverpool\u2019s Uruguay striker Luis Suarez banned eight matches for using racist language. Chelsea\u2019s John Terry has also been removed as England captain ahead of his July trial for alleged racial abuse of Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand during a Premier League match in October \u2013 a charge he denies. Why is the England football team always in crisis? \u201cThere have been a couple of examples recently, which is not good,\u201d said the 70-year-old Ferguson, who has been United manager for over 25 years. \u201cIn 2012 you can\u2019t believe it. I think it was obvious maybe 20 years ago, but the improvements have been there for all to see.\u201d Ferguson, who has led the Old Trafford club to 12 English titles and two European Champions League triumphs, said he did not understand why racism in football had once again reared its head. \u201cI\u2019ve had some fantastic black players, absolutely magnificent black players, and every one I\u2019ve enjoyed my working relationship with them. So I don\u2019t understand where it\u2019s coming from to be honest with you. I don\u2019t understand it at all,\u201d he said in a CNN interview at the Laureus Sports Awards. \u201cThis is a moment where we have to take stock. I think they should do something about it if it\u2019s surfacing again and really be hard and firm on any shape or form of racism.\u201d Suarez returned to action for Liverpool as a second-half substitute in Monday\u2019s 0-0 draw with Tottenham Hotspur and could again face Evra in Saturday\u2019s Premier League clash with United. Liverpool have backed Suarez since the incident first came to light, with the squad and manager Kenny Dalglish wearing t-shirts with the 25-year-old\u2019s image on prior to a match with Wigan in December.  Dalgish remained insistent that Suarez should not have been banned following Monday\u2019s home game. \u201cFantastic for us to get Suarez back \u2013 he should never have been out in the first place,\u201d Dalglish told reporters.  \u201cIt would have been totally unfair to start him, having not played since Boxing Day. As much as we admire and love him, we\u2019ve also got to manage him.\u201d"

        "content": "It\u2019s the time of year when hammers are poised at the world\u2019s major auction houses and the strength of the art market for the coming year is tested.  Following a trend set in the last few years, Impressionist and Modern works of art are likely to be the big sellers.  \u201cImpressionist and Modern art has been very strong for a number of years, but it seems to be getting stronger and stronger,\u201d said Deborah Allan, Head of the Impressionist & Modern Art Department at Bonhams auction house in London.  \u201cIt\u2019s amazing really, even with the huge financial problems that have been happening worldwide,\u201d she said.  Bonhams clocked sales for works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Camille Pissarro, Amedeo Modigliani and Pablo Picasso at their Impressionist and Modern Sale Tuesday.  The star lots included a Modigliani portrait of a woman and a Picasso painting of Notre Dame in Paris, which sold for \u00a31.3 million and $1.4 million (\u00a3825,250 and \u00a3864,450) respectively, both just shy of their $1.6 million upper estimates.  On the same day, three works of art from the Elizabeth Taylor collection fetched a combined \u00a313.7 million ($21.7m) at Christie\u2019s auction house, more than doubling their pre-sale low estimate of \u00a36.2 million.  An additional 35 works from the film star\u2019s fine art collection will be offered for sale on 8 February as part of Christie\u2019s continuing sales series devoted to Impressionist and Modern Art. Over at Sotheby\u2019s auction house in London, auctioneers also anticipate a healthy sale Wednesday, with star lots in the form of paintings by Claude Monet and Austrian painter Gustav Klimt. Dating from 1901, the painting by Klimt depicts the shore of a lake, bordered by birch trees, and is estimated to sell for between $9.5 million and $13 million (\u00a36 million and \u00a38 million).   It is particularly unique because it has been in the same family collection for over 100 years, said Helena Newman, Chairman of Sotheby\u2019s Impressionist and Modern Art, Europe. See also: Leonardo: The man, the myth, the mystery \u201c(The painting) hasn\u2019t been seen in a public exhibition or appeared at auction and it\u2019s rather exciting for the market place because that sort of thing only happens very rarely,\u201d she said.  Interest in the Viennese symbolist painter, perhaps best-known for his 1907 painting \u201cAdele Bloch-Bauer I\u201d \u2013 which sold in 2006 for a reported $135 million, at the time the highest sum ever paid for a painting \u2013 has been steadily growing these last few years.  A landscape painting by Klimt, which had been stolen by the Nazis and eventually returned to the heir of the original owner, sold at Sotheby\u2019s in New York in November 2011 for $40.4 million.  With 2012 marking the 150th anniversary of the artist\u2019s birth, it is quite possible that the 1901 work \u201cLakeshore with birches\u201d will smash its upper estimate at Sotheby\u2019s on Wednesday.   Also included in the sale is a painting of a snowy landscape by Impressionist artist Claude Monet, which like the Klimt is entering the market after a long period \u2013 nearly 100 years \u2013 in a private collection.  It is expected to sell for between $7 million and $10 million (\u00a34.5 million and \u00a36.5 million).  \u201cIt\u2019s from the mid-1880s, when Monet was at Giverny,\u201d said Newman of Sotheby\u2019s.  \u201cThere was an account of some snow falling and (Monet) immediately muffled himself up and went out and put his easel on the road in order to capture en plein air the extraordinary effect of the light,\u201d she explained.    Despite a rocky year in the financial markets, Newman believes that the range and depth of works in the sale at Sotheby\u2019s reflects confidence in the market.  See also: Picasso, Mondrian works stolen in Athens heist \u201cSellers have recognized that there is a huge global demand for a whole range of collectors both established and relatively new who are looking to buy top quality material of Impressionist and Modern art,\u201d she said.  Allan at Bonhams echoed this, saying that the market for Impressionist and Modern art is particularly strong because as less great works with historical provenance come on the market, they become more and more expensive.  \u201cI think also with the true globalization of buyers, (the market is now) so international, and with the internet and internet bidding, it\u2019s so easy to access our sales (and) it\u2019s really changed the market,\u201d she said.   And paintings by Impressionists escape a recently implemented EU Artist\u2019s Resale Right Directive, which applies to European artists who have died in the past 70 years as well as living European artists \u2013 though Newman doesn\u2019t believe the charge, which caps at a maximum of 12,500 Euros ($16,500) on a transaction, will deter buyers.   \u201cThe average lot value in our evening sale is \u00a31.5 million ($1.9 million) so in the grand scheme of things I don\u2019t anticipate that it will have a measurable effect,\u201d said Newman."

        "content": "The publisher of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s now defunct News of the World tabloid paid out hundreds of thousands of pounds Wednesday to settle lawsuits over phone hacking from celebrities and politicians, including a former Tony Blair spokesman. The publisher apologized for intercepting phone messages of Alastair Campbell, the Blair aide, and agreed to pay costs and damages, Campbell said in a statement.  He did not say how much the settlement was worth. With Wednesday\u2019s settlements, News Group Newspapers has settled 59 of the 60 lawsuits against it. But former child singing star Charlotte Church, who has testified publicly about the damage phone hacking did to her personal life, has refused to settle. Her case is expected to go to court as soon as this month. The phone-hacking scandal prompted Murdoch\u2019s son, News Corp. executive James Murdoch, to shut down News of the World in July. The best-selling British newspaper was 168 years old. Wednesday\u2019s agreement may not end Campbell\u2019s legal action against Murdoch\u2019s newspaper group, lawyer Gerald Shamash said. The publisher said it would continue searching for documents related to the hacking of Campbell\u2019s voice mail and disclose what it found to him.   News Group Newspapers \u201chas agreed that Mr. Campbell may be entitled\u201d to further legal action, Shamash said. Comic actor Steve Coogan, who also settled Wednesday, echoed the words of many who have sued over phone hacking. \u201cThis has never been about money,\u201d he said outside the court. \u201cLike other people who have sued, I was determined to do my part to show the depths to which the press can sink in pursuit of private information.\u201d British Prime Minister David Cameron set up an independent inquiry into press ethics and practices in response to the scandal, and police are carrying out three separate investigations into elements of it: phone hacking, e-mail hacking, and police bribery. Two parliamentary committees are also investigating the scandal. The publisher of the shuttered tabloid is paying \u00a340,000 ($63,000) and legal costs to Coogan, \u00a345,000 ($71,000) plus costs to Liberal Democrat politician Simon Hughes, and \u00a375,000 ($119,000) plus costs to sports agent Sky Andrew, lawyers and judges announced Wednesday. Retired soccer star Paul Gascoigne was paid \u00a368,000 plus costs. The Murdoch group admitted both hacking his phone messages and having him followed by a private investigator, Derek Webb. Former lawmaker George Galloway got \u00a325,000 ($40,000) plus costs as the publisher admitted hacking his phone messages after the start of the second Gulf war. A number of other high-profile figures, including actors Jude Law and Sienna Miller, and former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, have already received settlements from Murdoch\u2019s publishing group. Its parent company, News International, said at the time that the company \u201cmade no admission as part of these settlements that directors or senior employees knew about the wrongdoing by NGN or sought to conceal it. However, for the purpose of reaching these settlements only, NGN agreed that the damages to be paid to claimants should be assessed as if this was the case.\u201d Both James and Rupert Murdoch, as well as senior executives at News International, have testified before British lawmakers examining allegations of wrongdoing. There have been 13 arrests in connection with Operation Elveden, the Metropolitan Police investigation into bribery of police officers by journalists. There have been 17 arrests in relation to Operation Weeting, the phone-hacking inquiry. Three people have been arrested in connection with both investigations. No one has been charged. "

        "content": "Williams and Toro Rosso both unveiled their cars for the 2012 Formula Season on Tuesday as the first official preseason testing event began at the Jerez circuit in Spain. Williams, a legendary name in F1 with nine constructors\u2019 titles but none since 1997, hope the FW34 will help the UK-based team improve on a disappointing 2011 campaign which produced just five points in 19 races. Williams recruited Brazilian Bruno Senna as a replacement for his veteran compatriot Rubens Barrichello, who is without an F1 seat for the first time since 1993. Senna is following in the footsteps of his legendary uncle Ayrton, a three-time world champion who died following a crash at Imola in 1994 in his third race for Williams. Can Senna restore the romance to Formula One? \u201cI\u2019m very excited to be back in action,\u201d the 28-year-old, who raced for Renault in the second half of last season, told the team\u2019s official website. \u201cThis is my ever first preseason testing program since I started in Formula One two years ago.  \u201cI\u2019m really motivated and looking forward to working hard and with everyone in the team. I hope we have a successful month testing and developing the car so we arrive in Melbourne as well prepared as possible.\u201d Senna will be paired with Pastor Maldonado, the Venezuelan who scored only one point during his rookie F1 season in 2011. Maldonado posted the 11th-fastest lap at Jerez on the first of four test days. Vettel: \u2018Red Bull out to dominate again\u2019 \u201cIt feels great to be back with the team and to start putting some mileage on the FW34,\u201d said the 26-year-old. \u201cThe car felt good and the systems were all working well this morning.  \u201cI like the feel of the new Renault engine as well. It\u2019s still too early to make any predictions, but we are pushing hard and working to understand the car better.\u201d Toro Rosso hope to build on an encouraging 2011 haul of 41 points \u2013 the Italy-based team\u2019s highest total in F1. Australia\u2019s Daniel Ricciardo forms a new driver line-up with French rookie Jean-Eric Vergne, replacing Switzerland\u2019s Sebastien Buemi and Spaniard Jaime Alguersuari. Ricciardo spent the second half of last season racing for Spanish team HRT, but failed to finish higher than 18th in any of his 11 grands prix. He drove for Toro Rosso on Tuesday and posted a lap of one minute 20.694 seconds \u2013 the fifth-fastest time. \u201cIt was great to experience taking a completely new car out of the garage,\u201d the 22-year-old said. \u201cWe had a very productive morning and made good progress with our program.  \u201cThen in the afternoon, we did a couple of longer runs, but had to cut it short. I\u2019m looking forward to another productive day tomorrow, because this car is very enjoyable to drive.\u201d Vergne \u2013 a Formula Three world champion two years ago \u2013 drove Red Bull\u2019s 2010 championship-winning car at last November\u2019s young drivers\u2019 test event in Abu Dhabi. \u201cLast year, we finished eighth in the constructors\u2019 championship and clearly we want to do better than that this time,\u201d said team principal Franz Tost.  \u201cIt is far too early to make predictions, but looking at the work we have done over the winter, we must set ourselves the target of finishing sixth or at least seventh by the time we pack up in Brazil in November.\u201d The returning Kimi Raikkonen led the field for Lotus at Jerez with a time of 1:19.670. The 2007 world champion left the elite division of motorsport in 2009 and has since had spells in NASCAR and the World Rally Championship. Force India\u2019s British driver Paul di Resta was second fastest on 1:19.772, with Mercedes\u2019 German pilot Niko Rosberg third. Australian Mark Webber was on display for Red Bull \u2013 with reigning champion Sebastian Vettel set for outings Thursday and Friday \u2013 and posted the fourth-fastest time with a lap of 1:20.496. The 2009 title winner Jenson Button could only manage eighth place for McLaren, with Ferrari\u2019s Brazilian Felipe Massa ninth. Button\u2019s fellow Brit and the 2008 champion Lewis Hamilton will be in action for McLaren on Thursday and Friday, along with Ferrari\u2019s two-time title winner Fernando Alonso."

        "content": "Charles Dickens, who was born 200 years ago this week, created some of the best-known and most loved figures in English literature, from Oliver Twist and David Copperfield to Pip, Miss Havisham and Magwitch. But of all the characters he wrote about, none played as important a role in his work as that of London itself: its hustle and bustle, its glittering promise and grimy streets and the extremes of poverty and wealth experienced by those who lived there.   Alex Werner, the curator of the Museum of London\u2019s \u201cDickens and London\u201d exhibition, says the city was \u201cabsolutely central\u201d to Dickens\u2019 work. \u201cIt triggered his imagination,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cHe called it his \u2018magic lantern\u2019, and would spend hours pacing the streets, drawing inspiration from what he saw around him.\u201d Read more: Dickens admirers mark bicentenary London was Dickens\u2019 muse, helping to spark his creativity and provide ideas for some of the most memorable characters, settings and plot twists in English literature. As Britain \u2013 and literature lovers the world over \u2013 celebrates Dickens\u2019 bicentenary in 2012, what better time to explore the city he knew and loved best? Dickens in London Dickens moved to London as a child, but the family soon ran into financial trouble: His father was sent to debtors\u2019 prison, and at the age of just 12, Dickens was forced to work in a shoe polish factory \u2013 Warren\u2019s Blacking Warehouse, at Hungerford Stairs \u2013 to support his mother and siblings.  \u201cIt was a crazy, tumbledown old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats\u2026 the dirt and decay of the place rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again,\u201d he later told his biographer, John Forster. Both the warehouse and the stairs, near what is now Embankment tube station, are long gone. The Charles Dickens Museum is housed in Dickens\u2019 former family home, in Doughty Street. It was here that he wrote \u201cOliver Twist\u201d and \u201cNicholas Nickleby.\u201d  Opened in 1925, the museum holds the world\u2019s most important collection of Dickens items, including his pens, letters, and furniture. It is to close for much of 2012 as part of a 3.1 million redevelopment project, but is expected to reopen before Christmas. The offices of All The Year Round, one of the magazines Dickens founded to publish his stories, are on Wellington Street, just off the Strand. At the height of Dickens\u2019 popularity, crowds would gather outside to wait for the latest episode. Today the Charles Dickens Coffee House is on the ground floor. Dickens is buried in Westminster Abbey\u2019s Poets\u2019 Corner, alongside other literary greats including Geoffrey Chaucer, Alfred Tennyson and Thomas Hardy. Many of the other members of the Dickens family, including his parents, John and Elizabeth \u2013 the models for Mr Micawber and Mrs Nickleby \u2013 his ex-wife Katherine, sister, and nephew \u2013 the inspiration for Tiny Tim in \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d \u2013 are buried in Highgate Cemetery. To mark the Dickens bicentenary, the cemetery is hosting Dickens tours. Dickens\u2019 ties to London, and the role that the city played in his novels, are celebrated in the Museum of London\u2019s \u201cDickens and London\u201d exhibition, which runs until June 10, 2012. The show features items from the author\u2019s own life \u2013 his desk, and manuscripts \u2013 as well as those evoking the city as he knew it. London in Dickens A century and a half of modernisation has meant that many of the locations in Dickens\u2019 novels no longer exist \u2013 but eagle-eyed visitors can still catch a glimpse of the city as Pip or Oliver would have recognized them. \u201cThere is very little left,\u201d says Clare Pettitt, Dickens specialist at King\u2019s College London. \u201cYou can track Dickens\u2019 London, and see where things were, but they aren\u2019t necessarily still there.\u201d One site that Dickens returned to again and again, both in real life and in his novels (it features in \u201cOliver Twist\u201d and \u201cThe Pickwick Papers\u201d), is Covent Garden \u2013 though in his day, it was a proper working market, rather than the touristy shopping area it is today. Just around the corner, Bow Street Magistrates\u2019 Court \u2013 now a police station \u2013 is mentioned in both \u201cOliver Twist\u201d and \u201cBarnaby Rudge.\u201d As a young man, Dickens worked as a solicitor\u2019s clerk, and the Inns of Court, which in his day were home to many of the city\u2019s legal professionals, feature heavily in his works. Lincoln\u2019s Inn and Chancery Lane both feature heavily in \u201cBleak House\u201d, and nearby is The Old Curiosity Shop, one of the oldest shops in London. Gray\u2019s Inn is used as a location in both \u201cDavid Copperfield\u201d and \u201cThe Pickwick Papers\u201d. The tranquil square at historic Staple Inn, Holborn, is mentioned in Dickens\u2019 final, unfinished novel, \u201cThe Mystery of Edwin Drood,\u201d where he reports that it \u201cimparts on the relieved pedestrian the sensation of having put cotton in his ears and velvet soles on his feet.\u201d  The bells of the clock tower in St Dunstan-in-the-West Church, Fleet Street, are the ones which wake Scrooge to his new life at the end of \u201cA Christmas Carol.\u201d Raise a glass to Dickens Pubs and taverns featured heavily in both Dickens life and his work, and several of those mentioned in his stories and letters are still serving today. Pettitt says one of his favourites was Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, just off Fleet Street. The pub features in \u201cA Tale of Two Cities,\u201d and has a wider literary pedigree, having also been a haunt of Samuel Johnson, W.B. Yeats and Mark Twain. Pettitt also recommends The Grapes pub in Limehouse, east London. \u201cIt features in \u2018Our Mutual Friend,\u2019 and feels very \u2018Dickensian\u2019, overlooking the river, which was so important in his works, though of course these days it\u2019s not as full of boats as it was in his day.\u201d And across the river in Greenwich, Alex Werner suggests the Trafalgar Tavern, which was famed, in Dickens\u2019 day, for its whitebait suppers. \u201cDickens\u2019 letters are full of suggestions for various excursions along the river,\u201d explains Pettitt. \u201cHe was always writing to people saying \u2018Let\u2019s go down to X and stop for dinner at Y\u2019 \u2013 there was always a culinary target to his expeditions.\u201d City walks An insomniac, Dickens spent many hours walking London\u2019s streets in the dead of night.  \u201cHe knew its alleys and streets better than anyone,\u201d said Werner, explaining that some of Dickens\u2019 greatest works came about as a result of these lengthy strolls. \u201cWe know from his letters that in October and November 1863, for example, he was walking 10 to 15 miles a night, while working on his book.\u201d In the spirit of the man himself, several Dickens walking tours take place around the city.  London Walks runs a Charles Dickens\u2019 London tour every Friday afternoon at 2.30pm, departing from Temple tube station. The company also runs special Dickensian Christmas walks in late November and December. To mark Dickens\u2019 bicentenary, the Dickens Museum is running a weekly Dickensian London walk each Wednesday evening, from February 8 to April 4, departing from the museum, in Doughty Street, at 5pm.

The Berlin Prosecutors\u2019 Office denied any connection between the suspects arrested Tuesday and those involved in an attack on the Syrian opposition activist and Green Party politician Ferhad Ahma in Berlin last December. The Syrian government has been accused of seeking retribution against relatives of Syrian activists working against the Bashar al-Assad regime from abroad.  The U.S. State Department announced last year that it had received reports that Syrian mission personnel had been conducting video surveillance of people participating in peaceful demonstrations in the United States. Other Syrian activists living abroad have also declined to be named or appear on camera for fear of reprisals against their families at home. In August, a rebel military leader living in exile in Turkey disappeared from a refugee camp and reappeared days later in Syrian government custody. Evidence also suggested that the government carried out reprisal attacks against the man\u2019s family. "

        "content": "In many ways, Maha Haddioui is the archetypal young professional women\u2019s golfer, desperate to make a breakthrough on one of the major tours in Europe or the United States.  Educated at an American university, the 22-year-old speaks four languages. Her Facebook page lists has hundreds of friends from all over the world. A stylist on the course, she sports an elegant line in clothing \u2013 more often than not wearing a polo shirt and pink skirt. But, unlike her peers, Haddioui is a trailblazer in a region of the world that has seen turmoil and political upheaval over the past year, and where women\u2019s freedoms are often severely restricted. Hailing from Morocco, she\u2019s the first Arab woman to compete in a professional golf tournament. Her lifetime ambition is to follow in the footsteps of the North African nation\u2019s legendary middle-distance track and field athletes and win Olympic gold. Golf will return to the four-yearly sporting showpiece in Brazil in 2016 after an absence of more than a century. \u201cI have always watched the Olympics with my father and it is the biggest sports event worldwide,\u201d Haddioui told CNN. \u201cWe have had some great Moroccan athletes like Hicham El Guerrouj that have made the country proud, and my dream is to follow in their footsteps.\u201d  Fortunately for Haddioui, she was brought up by a liberal family who did not insist on traditional dress code for their young daughter. Able to practice on local courses near their home in Agadir, she quickly showed an aptitude for golf and received support from the country\u2019s ministry of sport. She has spent four years on the collegiate golf circuit in the United States, studying at Lynn University in Florida and earning the accolade of top-ranked NCAA Division II women\u2019s golfer during that time. When she graduated, the repercussions of the Arab Spring began to be felt in the wider region, and in Morocco there were also demands for democratic change. The bulk of the country has been ruled by a monarchist dynasty since the 17th century, with King Mohammed VI holding power since 1999. With regimes in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya swept away, Morocco\u2019s 48-year-old ruler promised reforms. In November\u2019s election he was obliged to choose the prime minister from the largest party, rather than by his own personal choice.  He had, in 2004, introduced measures which addressed women\u2019s rights. \u201cI am a big supporter for freedom and peaceful change,\u201d Haddioui said. \u201cWe had a couple of peaceful protests in Morocco which have led to major changes in the constitution of the country, but we have enjoyed our freedoms in Morocco for decades.\u201d Haddioui is proud of her country and wants to represent it with distinction. \u201cMy aim is to be the first Moroccan and Arab golfer to make it into the European Tour,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope that there will be a lot more women that will follow in my footsteps.\u201d Success has already come with gold in women\u2019s golf at last year\u2019s Arab Games in Qatar in a team which included her younger sister Nezha. Last season, her first as a professional, Haddioui finished 25th in the Lalla Meryem Cup held in her hometown, and made the halfway cut at another Ladies\u2019 European Tour (LET) event in Germany. But it is a big step from collegiate golf to the cut-throat professional world, and this year she will again rely on invites to main tour events. A disastrous second-round 84 at the LET qualifying school in La Manga in Spain wrecked her chances of winning a card with full playing rights. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened there, it was a tough week,\u201d she admitted. But Haddioui is undeterred and will be looking to her home tournament in March on the Golf de l\u2019Ocean course in Agadir to make a big impression. With a men\u2019s European Tour event, the Hassan II Trophy, and the Lalla Meryem Cup held in the same week at the end of next month, plus a host of regional tournaments, Morocco is promoting itself as a golf destination par excellence. Outside investment, mainly from the Middle East, has brought several new courses and developments \u2013 as Haddioui says, \u201ctaking advantage of our fantastic weather and the opportunity to share a very rich culture.\u201d Haddioui aside, Moroccan players either male or female have yet to make a much of an impression among the professional elite, but all that could be changing. \u201cGolf is becoming more affordable for locals thanks to the work of the Royal Golf Federation,\u201d she said. With more youngsters playing, the talent is starting to emerge. Ahmad Marjan, 18, has earned an invite to this week\u2019s Dubai Desert Classic, where he will rub shoulders with some of the best players in the world. Haddioui will target December\u2019s Dubai Ladies\u2019 Masters on the LET as she tries to earn enough money to get an automatic card for 2013. Though proud of her roots and background, it was her spell in the United States that decided on her career path. \u201cGetting an education in the U.S. is definitely the best choice I have made in my life,\u201d she said.  \u201cIt allowed me to play golf and pursue my education at the same time. It has prepared me for my current life as a professional golfer where I have to travel on my own.\u201d"

Cardinal William Levada said Benedict, before becoming pope, enacted many of the reforms that followed the eruption of the church\u2019s sex-abuse scandal a decade ago.  \u201cBut the pope has had to suffer attacks by the media over these past years in various parts of the world, when he should receive the gratitude of us all, in the church and outside it,\u201d Levada said in his opening address to the conference.  Levada leads the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican office charged with enforcing church law. Benedict held the same post before he became pope in 2005.  During that period, the office was charged with cleaning up after the revelations that church officials protected priests who were accused of molesting young parishioners, particularly in the United States and Europe. The scandal has led to criminal charges and expensive legal judgments in cases that are still working their way through the courts.  This week\u2019s event at Gregorian University in Rome features the launch of a three-year program aimed at setting up \u201crobust procedures\u201d to handle allegations of abuse, according to organizers. But a U.S.-based victims\u2019 group, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, dismissed the event as \u201cwindow dressing\u201d on Monday. \u201cWho will be leading the discussion? The very same \u2018experts\u2019 and church officials who bear responsibility for the continued global cover-up of clergy child sex crimes,\u201d the group said on its website. The group included Levada, the former archbishop of San Francisco, as one of those officials. Levada said more than 4,000 cases of sexual abuse had been reported to his office in the past decade, revealing the need for \u201ca truly multifaceted response.\u201d He reaffirmed that church leaders have \u201can obligation to cooperate with the requirements of civil law regarding the reporting of such crimes to the appropriate authorities,\u201d but added that the offenders \u201care a tiny minority of an otherwise faithful, committed clergy.\u201d"

Suarez\u2019s enforced spell on the sidelines came after the English Football Association found him guilty of racially abusing Manchester United\u2019s Patrice Evra, but he couldn\u2019t break the deadlock in a tense game. The point was a blow for both teams as third-placed Tottenham failed to grab a victory that would have seen them close within five points of leaders Manchester CIty, and three points of Manchester United in second. For Liverpool, the draw is their eighth at Anfield this season \u2013 a run that has hit their chances of qualifying for the European Champions League. They sit seventh, four points behind Chelsea in fourth. After the match Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish suggested Suarez shouldn\u2019t have been banned in the first place. He told Sky Sports: \u201cI\u2019m delighted that he is back. He should never have been away but we\u2019ve taken the punishment and we\u2019ve moved on. It would have been unfair to start him, he\u2019s not played since Boxing Day.\u201d Heavy fog in Liverpool meant that Tottenham\u2019s manager Harry Redknapp was unable to attend the match \u2013 his flight from London was canceled after he had spent the day in court where he is being tried on a charge of tax evasion. The first half offered little in the way of chances, Jay Spearing\u2019s shot that arrowed just wide of Tottenham goalkeeper Brad Friedel\u2019s post the highlight. But the game came to life in the second half as Friedel saved Martin Kelly\u2019s long range shot before Suarez was introduced on 66 minutes to a standing ovation. The striker wasted little time making an impact, but for the wrong reasons, as he was booked for kicking Scott Parker in the stomach while attempting a volley. Suarez\u2019s strike partner Andy Carroll wasted a clear chance when he blazed over from 12 yards out after he\u2019d taken down Steven Gerrard\u2019s cross. It was Tottenham and Wales midfielder Gareth Bale who had the game\u2019s best chance as he went clean through on goal six minutes from time but he sent his shot straight at Pepe Reina.

The Serbian tennis star clinched three grand slam titles in 2011 and won an astonishing 41 games in a row during the season, tasting defeat only six times. He claimed the Australian Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open crowns and has started 2012 in equally impressive fashion, retaining his Melbourne title in an epic final against Rafael Nadal last month. Djokovic\u2019s victory saw him become only the fifth man in the Open Era to win three grand slam titles in a row, and convinced the 47 sportsmen and women that make up the Laureus World Sports Academy to hand him the prestigious gong. \u201cWhat stands out most for me is meeting all these legends of the sport, to exchange experiences and life stories,\u201d he told CNN World Sport\u2019s Pedro Pinto.  \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing experience I will never forget.

        "content": "Greek union members are expected to go on a daylong strike Tuesday to protest new austerity measures sought by foreign lenders as the country negotiates to keep its finances afloat. Officials in Greece are under pressure to reach an agreement on a new bailout package with the threat of a default hanging over the country. Prime Minister Lucas Papademos met with officials from the European Union, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank on Monday to try and hammer out the details of a \u20ac130 billion bailout deal. Greece needs the money to avoid defaulting on a \u20ac14.5 billion bond redemption in March. The concern is that a so-called disorderly default could force Greece out of the euro monetary union and shock the global financial system. Papademos must also convince the leaders of Greece\u2019s three main political parties to back a package of fiscal and economic reforms that are a condition of the bailout. The party leaders agreed over the weekend on the \u201cmain elements\u201d of the program, including a plan to reduce public spending by 1.5% of gross domestic output this year, according to Papademos. But talks scheduled for Monday were pushed back to Tuesday amid apparent disagreements over additional job and salary cuts, as well as pension reforms and tougher tax enforcement. The country\u2019s unions say they are unhappy with the new demands. They have called many strikes in the past few years to protest the successive waves of austerity measures announced by the authorities. Greece, which owes some \u20ac330 billion, has come close to default before. The nation has struggled to follow through on budget cuts and economic reforms that were a condition of its 2010 bailout package. But the nation\u2019s economy has been in recession for years and many analysts warn that additional austerity could make the situation worse.  EU leaders have been sounding increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress in Greece. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France said Monday that failure was not an option for Greece, adding that \u201cconsiderable measures\u201d had been put in motion to help the nation \u201cout of the situation it finds itself in today.\u201d \u201cBut the Greek leaders have made commitments and they must respect these scrupulously,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no choice, there is no choice.\u201d EU finance ministers are widely expected to hold an \u201cextraordinary\u201d meeting sometime this week, although no official date has been set. Meanwhile, Greece appears close to a deal with its creditors in the private sector to write down a portion of the nation\u2019s debt. The agreement, which would result in significant losses for bondholders, is intended to help reduce Greece\u2019s debts to 120% of GDP by 2020, from about 160% currently. The worsening Greek economy has raised calls for the nation\u2019s creditors in the \u201cofficial sector\u201d to provide some relief. The European Central Bank, which holds an estimated \u20ac30 billion to \u20ac45 billion of Greek debt, is under pressure to forego profits on those bonds, as are individual euro area central banks."

        "content": "A Norwegian court concluded Monday that Anders Behring Breivik \u2013 the man charged with killing 77 people last July, an attack he claimed merited a medal of honor \u2013 can legally be kept in custody until his trial starts in April, according to court documents. The court acknowledged that Breivik\u2019s mental health remains an issue, noting that he may not be able to get the maximum possible punishment for the crimes if he\u2019s deemed insane.  Even so, the court found legal basis to keep him in custody for the next two months because prosecutors have said that if Breivik is found insane, they will push for him to be confined to a mental health facility, court documents state. Breivik is accused of killing eight people in a bomb attack in Oslo and 69 more in a gun rampage on nearby Utoya Island on July 22. It was the deadliest attack on Norwegian soil since World War II. The latter victims were among 700 mostly young people attending a Labour Party camp on the island. He has pleaded not guilty, though he has admitted carrying out the attacks, the judge handling his case said previously. In November, prosecutors said psychiatrists had determined Breivik was paranoid and schizophrenic at the time of the attacks and during 13 interviews experts conducted with him afterward.  Judge Wenche Elizabeth Arntzen told reporters in January that the court requested a second opinion because of the importance of the question of his sanity to Breivik\u2019s trial. Arizona shooting suspect Loughner to continue receiving treatment Two new psychiatrists were subsequently assigned to carry out the evaluation, court spokesman Geir Engebretsen said. Breivik reiterated some of his extremist views during Monday\u2019s court hearing, which began with him entering with a smile and offering up a raised, clenched-fist salute in solidarity. Confirming accounts posed to him by Norwegian reporters, his lawyer, Geir Lippestad, said Breivik said he did not accept the legitimacy of the presiding judge because he didn\u2019t believe in the multicultural Norway that the judicial system is part of. The lawyer\u2019s back-and-forth with reporters was captured by Norwegian media, including national broadcaster NRK. Breivik further claimed the shooting rampage was a matter of self-defense, meant to save Norway from being taken over by multicultural forces and prevent ethnic cleansing of Norwegians, according to Lippestad.  Rather than punishment, Breivik said he deserved a medal of honor, a statement that prompted derisive laughs from victims and relatives of those killed on Utoya Island. He also said nobody could believe that he was insane, describing questions about his mental makeup as ridiculous, Lippestad confirmed. Scheduled to begin April 16, Breivik\u2019s trial is expected to last 10 weeks. Authorities have described him as a right-wing Christian extremist. A 1,500-page manifesto attributed to Breivik posted on the Internet is critical of Muslim immigration and European liberalism, including Norway\u2019s Labour Party. The manifesto predicts that a \u201cEuropean civil war\u201d will lead to the execution of \u201ccultural Marxists\u201d and the banishment of Muslims. Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said in the aftermath of the attacks that his country had been fundamentally changed, but vowed that Norway would remain \u201can open society.\u201d"

At a convention of party leaders in Seville, Rubalcaba, the former deputy prime minister, defeated Carme Chacon, the former defense minister, by just 22 votes out of just over 950 cast. Rubalcaba becomes secretary general \u2013 the party\u2019s top executive \u2013 in place of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the two-term prime minister and secretary general who did not seek re-election last November.  Zapatero was badly damaged by the economic crisis that has left Spain with 5.2 million jobless and an unemployment rate of nearly 23 percent.  The conservative Popular Party swept to a commanding majority in parliament in the November 20 elections and the new prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has implemented more austerity cuts, tax hikes and other reforms to try to jump-start the stagnant economy. His term is for four years. The Socialists had to choose a new secretary general to try to start a process of renewal for the badly divided party. The division was evident again in the close vote on Saturday. Some analysts said the political veteran Rubalcaba, 60 \u2013 who has held key posts in two Socialist governments, most recently as deputy prime minister under Zapatero, and was the party\u2019s candidate for prime minister in November \u2013 would be a steadier hand to lead a party internal transition. He would then, potentially, make room for fresh faces who are not associated with Zapatero\u2019s government. He faced a bruising primary battle from Chacon, 40, who was defense minister under Zapatero. Party leaders insisted that despite the tight primary battle, the party would unite around the new secretary general. But the Socialists \u2013 who before losing nationally in November lost control of most key regional governments in May \u2013 are expected to have a long uphill climb before regaining power."

German driver Vettel has been unrivaled over the last two years, winning 16 races since the start of 2010 to become the sport\u2019s youngest two-time drivers\u2019 champion. The 24-year-old\u2019s peerless form \u2013 which earned him 11 grand prix wins in 2011 \u2013 has also helped Red Bull clinch back-to-back constructors\u2019 titles. Speaking at the launch of the new RB8, Vettel set his sights on securing a third successive Red Bull clean sweep. Alonso eyes glory as Ferrari unveil radical new design \u201cWe had a great year,\u201d Vettel told the sport\u2019s official website. \u201cI think we\u2019ll always look back to 2011 and think how special it was. \u201cWe know how special it was and we really enjoyed that but we know how hard it is to be that consistent, always there and nearly every race on the podium. \u201cSo the target is to obviously try to do it again and try to get everything out of ourselves, so we\u2019ll see how we get on with the new car, the RB8.\u201d Despite the success of the Austrian-owned, UK-based team \u2013 who entered the elite division of motorsport as recently as 2005 \u2013 Vettel warned against complacency ahead of the new season, which starts in Australia on March 18. \u201cAt the beginning of last year we didn\u2019t really expect whatever happened last year, so I think it\u2019s the same thing again. \u201cIt would be wrong to go into this season and expect 2011 to happen again \u2026 I think it will be very, very tight this year and anything else would be a surprise to be honest.\u201d New car gives McLaren confidence to end Red Bull dominance Vettel\u2019s Australian teammate Mark Webber endured a frustrating 2011, securing his first and only win of the year at the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix on his way to a third-place finish in the drivers\u2019 standings \u2013 134 points behind Vettel. \u201cLast year wasn\u2019t an amazing season, but it wasn\u2019t too bad for me,\u201d the 35-year-old said. \u201cI still managed to finish third in the drivers\u2019 championship \u2026 so it was a great way for me to finish the year with the victory in Brazil and many strong results. \u201cWe\u2019re always learning as athletes and I\u2019m looking forward to 2012, it\u2019s got some great opportunities for me. You know the old cliche, take each race as it comes, but that\u2019s how it will be initially and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d Another veteran on the grid next year will be Finland\u2019s Kimi Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion, who is returning to the sport after a two-season absence. The former Ferrari driver has joined Lotus \u2013 who competed in last year\u2019s championship as Renault \u2013 and spoke of his excitement at the launch of the team\u2019s new E20 car. \u201cFormula One is something very special in my racing career,\u201d said the 32-year-old, who participated in NASCAR and the World Rally Championship in his break from F1.  \u201cYou always want to race at the toughest level, so Formula One is where you want to race if you have a choice. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have a lot of fun in the season ahead and hopefully we will get some good results. I want a strong enough car to challenge for good results.\u201d Swiss team Sauber also showcased their new car on Monday, with Japanese driver Kamui Kobayashi and Mexico\u2019s Sergio Perez on hand to take the C31 for a spin. Kobayashi finished last season in 12th place, four positions and 16 points ahead of Perez, and he is looking forward to his third year with the team. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot together and can benefit from our shared experiences,\u201d Kobayashi said. \u201cIn my first year with the team we had a bad start but a good second half to the season.  \u201cThe second year was the exact reverse. In our third year together we should be a reliable bet to finish consistently in the points. I\u2019m really looking forward to the new season with the Sauber team.\u201d "

        "content": "A court in the United Kingdom has granted bail to a radical cleric accused of links to al Qaeda, the British Home Office said Monday. Abu Qatada has been imprisoned for years while fighting deportation, according to British media reports. The Home Office had opposed bail, and said after the decision that its view had not changed.   \u201cThis is a dangerous man who we believe poses a real threat to our security,\u201d the Home Office said through a spokesperson. \u201c\u2026 This is not the end of the road and we are continuing to consider our legal options.\u201d  The Jordanian national has been fighting to remain in the United Kingdom since he was first arrested under anti-terrorism legislation nearly a decade ago.  CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen said Abu Qatada was the spiritual adviser to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian Islamic militant who became the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq. Zarqawi and his followers were blamed for some of the bloodiest attacks of the eight-year war that followed the U.S. invasion in 2003.  Bergen said the case highlights the problems governments face in dealing with religious leaders accused of inspiring terror plots without carrying them out themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s not like these guys were mixing the chemicals for the bomb,\u201d Bergen said. But he said clerics like Abu Qatada \u201csort of give spiritual sanction to their followers [to] do violence, and that\u2019s what makes these kinds of cases hard to prosecute \u2013 because thought crime is difficult to prosecute.\u201d But Bergen said the conditions of Abu Qatada\u2019s bail make it \u201cvery difficult for him to do something.\u201d \u201cHe can\u2019t be deported, and yet the British courts have also said he can\u2019t be imprisoned,\u201d he said. \u201cSo where does that end up? That ends up with him living under some form of house arrest in the UK, for an indefinite period.\u201d In 2002, the British government said it suspected Qatada was a terrorist and a national security risk. Refusing him leave to stay in Britain, it ordered he be deported and detained him.  Earlier this month, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the United Kingdom could not deport him to Jordan, because evidence obtained by torture could be used against him there. British officials have described him as an \u201cinspiration\u201d for terrorists such as Mohammed Atta, the lead hijacker behind the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States. Abu Qatada \u2013 also known as Omar Othman \u2013 arrived in the United Kingdom in 1993 and applied for asylum on the grounds that he had been tortured by Jordanian authorities. He came to the United Kingdom on a forged United Arab Emirates passport, according to court documents, and claimed asylum for himself, his wife and their three children. The British government recognized him as a refugee and allowed him to stay in the country until 1998. Qatada applied to stay indefinitely but, while his application was pending, a Jordanian court convicted him in absentia for involvement in two 1998 terrorist attacks and a plot to plant bombs to coincide with the millennium. The British government subsequently claimed that he is a national security risk who raised money for terrorist groups, including organizations linked to Osama bin Laden; and that he publicly supported the violent activities of those groups. Qatada has denied the allegations. He remained in custody Monday pending bail, British media said."

        "content": "Eastern Europe remained in the grip of brutal cold and deep snows Tuesday, with authorities in Ukraine, the hardest-hit country, scrambling to help thousands of people whose lives are at risk due to the weather. At least 250 people have already died across the region during the cold snap, with 135 of the dead in Ukraine. Authorities there have set up an emergency hospital to deal with people suffering from cold-related conditions, and distributed 3,000 emergency relief tents across the country, they said. The tents are heated and can supply hot food and drinks to people with nowhere else to go. Kiev alone has more than 14,000 homeless people, authorities said \u2013 among the most vulnerable to winter. About 2,000 people have been hospitalized due to the cold since January 27, officials said. Electricity consumption in the country is at historic highs, Ukrainian energy minister Yuri Boyko said. Southeastern Europe will see more heavy snow in contrast to the northeast, which is predicted to shiver under temperatures much lower than its winter averages,  said CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward.  \u201cAll of Europe will be well below normal,\u201d Ward said, \u201c10-15 degrees below normal.\u201d  Cold air arriving from Siberia has been hitting maritime moisture from the Mediterranean Sea, turning it into frozen precipitation. This will continue, and Bosnia, Serbia and Macedonia are expected receive new layers of snow.  \u201cTurkey is also going to have heavy snow,\u201d said Ward.   The bitter cold temperatures in the northeast have been deadlier than the snow farther south, with many dying from hypothermia.  More than 50 people, most of them homeless, have died in Poland, according to Polish TVN.  At least 64 people have died because of the cold in Russia, the government said. Snow has also fallen as far west as Spain and snarled traffic in Brussels, Belgium.  Snowfall in Europe\u2019s southeast, close to the Mediterranean Sea, is cutting off roads and isolating areas from access to supplies. In Romania, where at least 39 people have died because of the cold snap, all \u201cnational roads,\u201d two-lane highways, in seven counties in the country\u2019s south and east were completely blocked, state news agency Agerpres reported Monday. Traffic was in chaos in the capital Bucharest and possible blizzards have been forecast for half the country in the coming days. In Bosnia helicopters delivered supplies to an isolated region Monday, while the military worked to restore infrastructure, according to state news agency FENA. Snow over 10 feet deep (three meters) covered the village of Zijemlje, which has been cut off from electricity for at least three days. In Italy, a Milan court delayed on Monday the trial of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on charges of bribery because of cold temperatures in the courtroom, according to the Italian ANSA news agency. It was moved to warmer chambers, which had often been the scene of another case involving Berlusconi, when he had been accused of paying for sex with a minor \u2013 a Moroccan girl known as \u201cRuby\u201d. The severe cold is forecast to continue all week, Ward said.  \u201cWe are definitely going to hit the two-week mark by this weekend.\u201d"

        "content": "The captain of the shipwrecked cruise liner Costa Concordia faced a closed-door hearing Monday over whether he should remain under house arrest.  Francesco Schettino faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship after the vessel struck rocks and rolled onto its side in the waters off the Italian island of Giglio on January 13. Sixteen bodies have been recovered, and 16 people remain missing from the roughly 4,200 people who were aboard the cruise liner. One of Schettino\u2019s lawyers, Salvatore Parascandola, said the defense team was \u201coptimistic\u201d that he would be freed from house arrest.  \u201cWe don\u2019t think that any of the (justifications) for Schettino\u2019s house arrest are valid. He is not going to escape or to repeat the crime,\u201d Parascandola said. Prosecutor Stefano Pizza did not speak to reporters as he entered or left the court. Prosecutors want Schettino\u2019s house arrest revoked and the captain sent back to jail to await trial. By law, the three-judge panel has three days to reach a verdict on house arrest. In his answers to prosecutors, defense attorneys and a judge investigating the case last month, Schettino admitted he made a \u201cmistake\u201d in striking the rocks.  \u201cI hit this projection of rock that seems almost stuck into the ship, but this was my mistake,\u201d Schettino said, according to a 126-page transcript. \u201c\u2026 There isn\u2019t anything I can say, as I was convinced that passing within .28 of a mile there wouldn\u2019t be any problem.\u201d The captain also brushed aside suggestions that at 15 knots, he was going too fast, as alleged by prosecutors. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a speed limit,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 We had more or less the speed needed to reach Savona on time.\u201d According to the transcript, Schettino said he ran the ship aground to keep it from sinking. \u201cThis is what allowed me to limit the tilting,\u201d he said. Maritime lawyer Jim Allsworth said the maneuver is \u201cfairly standard\u201d in the case of a ship taking on water and in danger of sinking or capsizing. \u201cThe best thing to do is to put it aground to stop it sinking.\u201d But in statements made during a phone conversation with a friend, Schettino said managers pressured him to steer the ship to the area where the collision occurred, two Italian newspapers reported Wednesday. La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera published excerpts from a telephone conversation Schettino had with a friend after his January 14 arrest. The captain called his friend from the prosecutor\u2019s office, and authorities tapped the phone, the newspapers said.  \u201cIn my place, someone else wouldn\u2019t have been so benevolent to have gone right under there, because they have pissed me off, go, go there,\u201d Schettino said, in an apparent reference to getting close to the island, according to the newspapers. \u201cThe shallows were there, but it wasn\u2019t signaled by the instruments that I had, and I went through \u2026 in order to follow what the managers wanted.\u201d Schettino attorney Alessandro Antichi confirmed the wiretap but would not comment on the conversation. The information should not have been published, he said, as it is part of the investigation. The man behind the steering wheel, Jacob Rusli Bin, told investigators that after the ship struck the rocks, Schettino cursed and said he had not seen them, La Repubblica reported. Both Costa Cruises and authorities have criticized Schettino\u2019s behavior.  Costa cannot conduct an independent investigation because prosecutors seized the ship\u2019s data recorder. The recorder had some connection problems but is working, Costa chief executive Per Luigi Foschi has said. It contains conversation recordings and navigation system data, he said. Cruise ship passengers described a scene of panic and confusion as they rushed for lifeboats. Some said the crew seemed overwhelmed and did not have accurate information on what was taking place. In the transcript, Schettino also described the chaos, saying that he helped passengers onto lifeboats and that some became stuck because of the angle of the listing ship. He said he was trying to launch a lifeboat when he realized he was no longer on board. \u201cI was then on the lifeboat. It isn\u2019t as if I had boarded it,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, I fell on its roof.\u201d However, in the wiretapped conversation, Schettino told the friend, \u201cWhen I understood that the ship was tilting, I decided to leave, and left,\u201d according to Corriere della Sera. A captain\u2019s leaving the ship with passengers still aboard is difficult to defend, said Italian criminal defense attorney Ugo Meucci, who does not represent Schettino. \u201cThis is a very difficult position because our law is very strong, and the risk is very high for the captain,\u201d who could face a 15-year jail sentence, Meucci said."

        "content": "Mali and Ghana are through to the semifinals of the Africa Cup of Nations after both achieved hard-fought quarterfinal victories on Sunday. Barcelona midfielder Seydou Keita scored the winning spot-kick for Mali as they defeated co-hosts Gabon 5-4 on penalties after the match finished 1-1 after 120 minutes in Libreville. Meanwhile, an extra time winner from Andre Ayew proved enough for World Cup quarterfinalists Ghana to edge past Tunisia 2-1 in the second match in Franceville. Mali will now face Ivory Coast in the last four, while a semifinal showdown with Zambia now awaits Ghana. Gabon looked on course to reach the last four for the first time in their history when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang set up Eric Mouloungui for a 55th minute opener. And the scoreline remained that way until six minutes from time when Bordeaux striker Cheick Diabate turned and fired home an equalizer for Mali.  With both sides scoring their first four penalties, Gabon\u2019s star player Aubameyang saw his spot-kick saved by Mali keeper Soumaila Diakite, leaving Keita to coolly slot home for Mali. Ghana continued their march towards a fifth Africa Cup of Nations title by seeing off a Tunisian side that ended the match with 10 men. Captain John Mensah opened the scoring for Ghana in the 10th minute, when he headed home a left-wing corner. Tunisia leveled three minutes before the break when Evian striker Sabeur Khalifa bravely headed in  Zouhaier Dhaouadi\u2019s teasing cross from the right. But Ghana secured the victory after 101 minutes when Tunisia goalkeeper Aymen Mathlouthi dropped a harmless-looking cross for Ayew to roll home from five yards out. And Tunisia\u2019s hopes of getting back into the game were effectively ended when Aymen Abdennour was sent off  for elbowing Ayew.  "

        "content": "Romania\u2019s prime minister resigned Monday in the wake of weeks of public protests against austerity measures and a deadly spell of bitterly cold weather. The resignation makes Romania the sixth European country to see a prime minister fall amid the debt crisis sweeping European Union member states.  Besides budgetary issues, criticism has also mounted over the government\u2019s handling of a recent, and continuing, cold snap \u2013 including snow-clogged streets, widespread power outages and other problems that contributed to the deaths of at least 34 people. Announcing his resignation on television, Prime Minister Emil Boc said he is not the kind of person to hang on to power, and that it is time to make space for another government.  He admitted making mistakes, but said he is sure Romania has a bright future. \u201cWe made this decision in order to alleviate the social and political situation in the country, (and) to not lose what Romanians have won with so much suffering \u2013 the country\u2019s economic stability,\u201d said Boc, who had been prime minister since 2008. Later Monday, President Traian Basescu appointed Mihai Razvan Ungureanu as his pick to be the nation\u2019s next permanent prime minister.  The 43-year-old Ungureanu was Romania\u2019s foreign minister from 2004 to 2007, and since then he has been the head of the east European nation\u2019s foreign intelligence service. \u201cI call for a new government to step in immediately,\u201d Basescu said in remarks broadcast on Romanian television. \u201cTomorrow, the new prime minister will negotiate with the ruling coalition to form a new government.\u201d  According to Romania\u2019s constitution, Ungureanu is now the country\u2019s new prime minister by virtue of having been appointed by Basescu. But he must get the approval of parliament in order to officially form a new government, including lining up a slate of ministers.  Ungureanu accepted the appointment, saying his political independence should help him fulfill his mandate.  \u201cThe government needs strong parliamentary support and the citizens\u2019 support as well,\u201d he said. Parliament is expected to approve a new government in the next 60 days. If it does not, parliament would be dissolved and early elections would be held. Currently, Romania is expected to have a local election in the spring and parliamentary elections in the fall.  Opposition politicians, who have boycotted parliamentary sessions since February 1, have called for new elections for a totally fresh start in Romania \u2013 and not a more incremental step of a new prime minister appointed by President Basescu, and with it a new government. After Monday\u2019s announcements, liberal leader Crin Antonescu signaled that he and other opposition leaders do not plan to  back Ungureanu or any new government that might form under him. \u201cWe believe this is an improvised solution by Basescu to keep the current coalition in power, although most Romanians don\u2019t agree with this,\u201d said Antonescu. The opposition met Monday evening with the president to discuss the political situation. Some echoed a sentiment voiced by protesters in recent weeks demanding that, in addition to Boc and his government, that Basescu himself resign. Antonescu said, \u201cPresident Basescu\u2019s resignation is the only way we could end this political crisis, but he told us that he won\u2019t step down.\u201d Some Romanians blame the government for imposing harsh austerity measures after the country received \u20ac20 billion  from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union. Demonstrators have carried banners reading, \u201cWhat are we going to eat, Basescu?\u201d and \u201cDown with the government.\u201d Protests turned violent on January 15, when some of the thousands of people gathered in central Bucharest clashed with police. Stores were vandalized and dozens were wounded.   The austerity measures, tensions between protesters and authorities, and political turnover are not unique to Romania.  In Europe, there have been months of unrest in Greece, while Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal have also seen changes of government as their leaders try to cut spending in order to stabilize the common, multi-national currency, the euro."

On Sunday, the American was once again in tears. But this time they were tears of joy after Stanley benefited from a similarly dramatic meltdown from Spencer Levin to seal a one-stroke win at the Waste Management Open in Phoenix, Arizona. Stanley carded a six-under-par 65 in the final round to finish 15 under for the tournament, while Levin blew a six-shot overnight lead by hitting a four-over 75. \u201cI think the biggest challenge was seeing if I could put last week behind me,\u201d Stanley told the PGA Tour\u2019s official website after picking up his first professional win. Why golf (and big business) still needs Tiger \u201cI think I did. You go from a very low point to a high point. I\u2019m not sure I expected to maybe recover this quickly.\u201d Stanley said his experience at Torrey Pines \u2013 where he triple-bogeyed the 18th and missed a five-foot putt in a playoff against eventual winner Brandt Snedeker \u2013 made his triumph all the better. \u201cI\u2019m never going to forget that,\u201d he said of his nightmare final round said. \u201cBut I think it makes this one a lot sweeter, just being able to bounce back.  \u201cI\u2019m kind of at a loss for words. I\u2019m very grateful for the support I\u2019ve gotten. It\u2019s unbelievable. Unbelievable turnaround.\u201d Levin\u2019s horrible round was compounded by a disastrous sequence of events at the par-five 15th, where his drive found a cactus patch before he hit his third shot into the water. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t my day, obviously,\u201d said Levin, who is still looking for his first Tour victory. \u201cBut I gave it away, simple as that. You have a six-shot lead and lose, you gave it away.  \u201cMy hat\u2019s off to Kyle. He played a great round. He went and got it. But if you\u2019ve got a six-shot lead and don\u2019t win, then I think it\u2019s on the player with the lead, for sure.\u201d Stanley took home a check for $1.098 million and moved to the top of the early-season FedEx Cup standings. Ben Crane (66) finished the weekend in second on 14 under, with Levin third on 13 under and D.J. Trahan on 12 under after a 66. World No. 19 Bubba Watson (70) was tied for fifth on 11 under alongside fellow Americans Brendan Steele (64) and Kevin Na (65). Keegan Bradley, the 2011 PGA Championship winner, was in a four-way tie for 15th after a four-under 67, with 2010 PGA Tour rookie of the year Rickie Fowler \u2013 ranked 37th in the world \u2013 carding a 69 to finish on six under in a six-way tie for 26th. Snedeker tied for 50th on two under after a 68."

Wimbledon champion Kvitova won her match against Julia Gorges on Saturday \u2013 and her 6-7 6-4 6-1 success over Sabine Lisicki in Sunday\u2019s opening singles rubber ensured the Czech had an unassailable 3-0 lead. Angelique Kerber restored some pride for the hosts with a 6-4 6-4 win over Lucie Hradecka, but Iveta Benesova and Barbara Zahlavovoa Strycova combined to win the final doubles rubber to secure a convincing victory. \u201cI had trouble with my returns at the beginning, but I knew what I had to do and things improved in the second set,\u201d Kvitova \u2013 who was winning her eighth Fed Cup match in a row \u2013 told the official tournament website. The Czechs will now face Italy in April\u2019s semifinals, while Germany face a relegation match to stay in the World Group top tier. Italy sealed their place in the last four when Flavia Pennetta and Roberta Vinci beat Ukrainian pair Lesia Tsurenko and Olga Savchuk 7-5 0-6 6-1 in the deciding doubles rubber in Biella. Meanwhile, Svetlana Kuznetsova guided Russia through to the semifinals with a 3-2 victory over Spain in Moscow. Leading 2-0 from the first day, the hosts suffered a blow when world number three Maria Sharapova pulled out of Sunday\u2019s opening singles through illness. And her replacement Nadia Petrova proved no match for Carla Suarez Navarro, with the Spanish No.1 romping to a 6-0 6-3 win in just over an hour. It was left to former French and U.S.Open champion Kuznetsova to complete the job for Russia, defeating Silvia Soler-Espinosa 6-2 4-6 6-3 in a hard-fought encounter. Spain won the dead doubles rubber, but it is Russia who go through to a last four encounter with Serbia. The Serbs secured their first-ever semifinal place with a thrilling 3-2 win over Belgium in Charleroi. When Yanina Wickmayer thrashed Aleksandra Krunic 6-1 6-0 to put the hosts 2-1 ahead, things looked bleak for Serbia. But despite the absence of star player Jelena Jankovic with a thigh injury, the visitors rallied and Bojana Jovanovski leveled the tie with a 6-2 6-4 victory over Kirsten Flipkens. And the turnaround was complete when Krunic and Jovanovski combined to defeat Wickmayer and 17-year-old debutant Alison van Uytvanck 7-6 4-6 6-1in the deciding doubles. Meanwhile, in the World Group second tier, Serena Williams completed her second singles win on her Fed Cup return to help the United States beat Belarus 4-1 in Worcester,  Massachusetts. Williams rallied from a set down to beat Anastasia Yakimova 5-7 6-1 6-1, to follow on from her victory over Olga Govortsova on Saturday. Yakimova was a late replacement for Australian Open champion and new world number one Victoria Azarenka, who was forced to withdraw with a back injury. The United States, who have won the competition a record 17 times, are playing in the second tier for the first time and must now win a playoff to return to the elite group in 2013.    "

Roma took a 13th minute lead when Juan headed home a Francesco Totti corner and Fabio Borini doubled their lead when firing a shot through the legs of goalkeeper Julio Cesar. Former Chelsea striker Borini added his second four minutes after the interval when racing onto Juan\u2019s pass to again shoot through Cesar\u2019s legs. And Bojan Krkic completed a miserable return to the Stadio Olympico for Inter coach Claudio Ranieri when he added a fourth goal a minute from time. The result leaves Inter in fifth place in the table, nine points off the lead, with Roma a further two points back in sixth position. To complete a perfect afternoon for Roma, they confirmed after the match that in-demand midfielder Daniele De Rossi had signed a five-year contract extension with the club. Juventus remain top on 45 points, and are still unbeaten after 21 games, despite a disappointing 0-0 draw at home to lowly Siena. They stay a point ahead of second-placed Milan, with a game in hand, after the Rossoneri were held 0-0 at home by Napoli. Milan will be thankful for the point after playing the final 20 minutes with 10 men following the dismissal of Zlatan Ibrahimovic for slappig Salvatore Aronica. On a day when Roma were the only top-seven team to secure three points, third-placed Udinese failed to close the gap after falling to a 3-2 defeat at Fiorentina. That result leaves Udinese four points behind Juventus, with Lazio still in fourth after their 3-2 loss at Genoa.    Meanwhile, in Germany,  Freiburg remain bottom of the Bundesliga despite recovering to earn a 2-2 home draw with fifth-placed Werder Bremen, for whom Claudio Pizzaro scored both goals. Sunday\u2019s other match saw Albanian midfielder Odise Roshi score the only goal as Cologne defeated Kaiserslautern 1-0. "

        "content": "Substitute Javier Hernandez scored a late header as champions Manchester United fought back from three goals down to earn a remarkable 3-3 Premier League draw at Chelsea on Sunday. On a bitterly cold afternoon in south-west London, United knew they needed a victory at Stamford Bridge to keep pace with rivals Manchester City at the top of the table. But they got off to a poor start and went into the interval a goal behind after defender Johnny Evans had inadvertently  turned Daniel Sturridge\u2019s cross into his own net. And United then suffered a double blow early in the second half as two goals in the space of just five minutes looked to have handed Chelsea victory. With the second 45 minutes barely a minute old, Fernando Torres\u2019 crash was superbly volleyed home by fellow-Spaniard Juan Mata to double Chelsea\u2019s lead. And United\u2019s defense was found wanting again soon afterwards when David Luiz was left unmarked to head home a free-kick. The visitors had been denied two first-half penalty appeals by referee Howard Webb, but the World Cup final official had no hesitation in pointing to the spot when Sturridge fouled Patrice Evra in the area. Wayne Rooney smashed home the 58th minute spot-kick to make it 3-1 and Rooney again held his nerve from the spot just 11 minutes later, this time Branislav Ivanovic was adjudged to have tripped Danny Welbeck. By now United were in the ascendency, and they drew level when Hernandez found space in the area to head home Ryan Giggs\u2019 cross from close range six minutes from time. However, only a superb flying save from much-criticized United goalkeeper David de Gea, to keep out Mata\u2019s last-minute free-kick, ensured the points were shared. Despite the fightback, United lose ground in the title race, with City now two points ahead of their rivals, with a much better goal difference as well. Chelsea remain in fourth place on 43 points, but Newcastle are now only a point behind in fifth after their Senegalese international strikers combined to beat Aston Villa 2-1. Demba Ba scored his 16th goal of the season, second only to Arsenal\u2019s Robin van Persie, to give Newcastle the lead, only for Robbie Keane to level for Villa from close range. But debutant Papiss Demba Cisse secured the three points for Newcastle with a stunning strike that arrowed into the top corner of the Villa net with 19 minutes remaining.   "

        "content": "Sixty years ago Monday, a 25-year-old woman visiting a remote part of Kenya got a message that her father had died.  She cut her trip short and flew home to London. Prime Minister Winston Churchill met her at the airport \u2013 because with her father dead, she had become Queen Elizabeth II. Celebrations of her Diamond Jubilee, marking six decades on the throne, officially begin Monday and continue through June, when London will mark the anniversary of her coronation with festivities including up to 1,000 boats sailing up the River Thames. On Monday, the queen thanked the public \u201cfor the wonderful support and encouragement that you have given to me and (husband) Prince Philip over these years.\u201d She said in the open letter that she planned to \u201cdedicate myself anew to your service.\u201d She called on people to \u201cgive thanks for the great advances that have been made since 1952 and to look forward to the future with clear head and warm heart\u201d in a brief letter that she signed simply \u201cElizabeth R.\u201d She was honored with a 41-gun salute in London\u2019s Hyde Park Monday, and a 21-gun salute in Edinburgh, Scotland. Two new photographs of the queen were released Monday as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, showing her wearing a necklace worn by Queen Victoria in her own Diamond Jubilee portrait in 1897. She is the oldest British monarch in history, but has not yet passed her great-great-grandmother Victoria as the longest-reigning one. Elizabeth II was not in line to the throne when she was born April 21, 1926. But the fate of Lilibet, as she was known to her friends, changed when her uncle Edward abdicated the thone to marry Wallis Simpson, an American divorcee. That made Elizabeth\u2019s stuttering father George king, and Elizabeth became queen when he died aged 56 following a lung operation.  The queen seems to have inherited her mother\u2019s longevity. Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, as she was known once George VI died, lived to be 101. The British monarch has no political power but Elizabeth has immense power as a figurehead. She is officially the head of state of 16 countries that used to be part of the British Empire, has met presidents and prime ministers, and has seen the world change beyond recognition during her reign. Following the queen\u2019s visit to Ireland in 2011 \u2013 the first by a British monarch since Irish independence \u2013 Prime Minister David Cameron described the effect Elizabeth is able to have when she chooses. At a state banquet, \u201csuddenly she started speaking in Irish, in Gaelic,\u201d Cameron recalled. \u201cIt came as a complete surprise to everybody including the president (of Ireland,) who looked around the room and mouthed the word \u2018Wow.\u2019 It was that kind of moment. You don\u2019t often get people at state banquets saying \u2018Wow,\u2019 but it was a wow moment.\u201d"

        "content": "Former Finnish Finance Minister Sauli Niinisto emerged victorious in the nation\u2019s presidential election Sunday, according to preliminary results.   According to Finland\u2019s Ministry of Justice, with 100% of votes counted, Niinisto defeated the nation\u2019s first openly gay presidential candidate, Pekka Haavisto, with 62.6% of the vote compared to Haavisto\u2019s 37.4%. Both were vying to succeed Tarja Halonen, Finland\u2019s first female president, who cannot run for re-election. In the first round of voting on January 28, the conservative Niinisto took just under 37% of the vote.  Haavisto, a pro-European Green League candidate, got 18.8%, claiming the No. 2 spot and narrowly edging out euro-skeptic Paavo Vayrynen, who had 17.5%. The winner of Sunday\u2019s vote between Niinisto and Haavisto will break a 30-year lock on the presidency by Halonen\u2019s Social Democrats. Halonen, who is completing her second term as president, defeated Niinisto, of the conservative National Coalition Party, in 2006. Both candidates are pro-Europe at a time when the European Union is facing a debt crisis that could threaten the bloc\u2019s common currency, the euro. The most vocally anti-Europe candidate, Timo Soini of the True Finns party, came in fourth last week, though his party is the third largest in parliament. Finland joined the euro when it was created, when Niinisto was finance minister. He insists Finland should stay in the eurozone despite the debt crisis that has taken some of the shine off the common currency. His party won the top share of votes in last April\u2019s parliamentary election, and leads a broad coalition government that includes the Social Democrats. Finland is one of the few remaining AAA-rated countries in the eurozone. But 2012 is expected to deliver a growth of only  0.4%, with the possibility of a new recession, its finance ministry reports. It has had to take part in the bailouts of other euro states that faced deep financial problems such as Greece and Ireland. Many Finns now see Niinisto \u2013 who also served as deputy chairman of the European Investment Bank \u2013 as someone who can stand up for Finland\u2019s interests in the single currency. Haavisto, meanwhile, has served as Finland\u2019s environment and development minister and has international experience working for the European Union and the United Nations in Sudan and the Middle East. Finland\u2019s president is in charge of the country\u2019s foreign policy, together with the government, and serves as commander-in-chief of its defense forces.  But recent changes have seen more power being given to the government and parliament, and former President Mauno Koivisto told YLE that there was a risk of an \u201cimbalance\u201d between the direct public election of the president and the office\u2019s diminishing power."

Twenty-year-old Cristian Tello opened the scoring in the ninth minute after receiving a beautifully weighted through-ball from Messi.  Barca found a second goal hard to come by and only doubled the lead 18 minutes before the end when Messi lifted the ball over keeper Bravo from an acute angle.  Sociedad pulled one back two minutes later as Carlos Vela slotted the ball past Victor Valdes, but Barca held on.

Ukraine appears to be the worst affected so far, with Poland, Romania, Serbia and Belarus also suffering much more severe winter conditions than usual. A total of 122 people have frozen to death in Ukraine since the cold spell started more than a week ago, the state-run news agency Ukrinform reported, citing government ministries. More than 1,500 people have been hospitalized, it said. In Rome, residents woke up to snow for the first time since 1985. The rare precipitation caused traffic jams and left some people stranded. While further west, in London, Heathrow Airport said it would cancel approximately 30% of its flights on Sunday in response to the winter weather. \u201cThis decision ensures that the greatest number of passengers can fly with the minimum amount of disruption. It also means that those passengers whose flights are canceled will know in advance, and can make alternative arrangements or rebook in relative comfort,\u201d said Normand Boivin, chief operating officer for the airport. CNN meteorologist Mari Ramos said the challenge now faced by many people is that the cold spell is lasting so long. The first reports of heavy snow came from Romania on January 26, Ramos said. Now, although temperatures are becoming more moderate, the snowfall will be very heavy. Twenty-nine people had died in Poland as of Thursday, according to the publicly funded Polish Radio\u2019s news website. Other cold-related deaths have been reported in Serbia, Romania and elsewhere in the past week."

        "content": "World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka will face a big test of her new status this weekend as women\u2019s tennis moves from singles tournament play to the Fed Cup teams event. The Australian Open champion will lead Belarus into action against the United States for the first time, but despite the stars on show they will be competing in the second tier of the competition. The U.S. team will be led by the Williams sisters Serena and Venus, both former No. 1s and the winners of a combined 20 grand slam singles titles. Serena lost in the last 16 in Melbourne last month, but Venus will return to action in California after a five-month absence after being diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder. Can anyone stop champion Djokovic? \u201cI think just being on a team and just having some adrenaline just gives me even more energy, to be honest,\u201d the 31-year-old \u2013 who revealed she was suffering from Sjogren\u2019s Syndrome in September \u2013 told reporters. Venus also admitted it was difficult to deal with the restrictions her illness had placed on her attempts to return to the court.  She has not played a competitive match since the U.S. Open first round in August, but faced her younger sister in an exhibition match in November. \u201cThe difference is acceptance,\u201d said Venus, who was part of the U.S. team which lifted the Fed Cup in 1999. \u201cTrying to accept how you feel and limitations. Listening to your body and taking care of yourself. \u201cInstead of trying to run through a wall, just really kind of take a step back and be smart. I think that\u2019s kind of what I\u2019ve learned. \u201cI still have to be reminded to slow down, but hopefully there will be a day when I don\u2019t have to be reminded of that.\u201d The U.S. team are in the second tier of the tournament for the first time after being relegated from World Group I last year. Serena, a 13-time grand slam winner, is looking forward to teaming up with her sister ahead of their possible pairing at the London 2012 Olympics. \u201cWe played on the same team a few times,\u201d said Serena, who was also part of the team which defeated Russia in 1999. \u201cWe always have a blast and always make the best of everything.  \u201cWe really enjoy every moment together because we don\u2019t sometimes get to spend a lot of time together. It\u2019s something that we really enjoy.\u201d The main World Group matches see the Czech Republic begin the defense of their title away to Germany, while Australian Open finalist Maria Sharapova leads last season\u2019s runners-up Russia against Spain in Moscow. Belgium, who reached the last four in 2011, will be without Melbourne semifinalist Kim Clijsters for the home clash with Serbia, headed by world No. 13 Jelena Jankovic. Italy, beaten by Russia in last year\u2019s semis, take on Ukraine on clay in Biella."

        "content": "John Daly was left at the top of the Qatar Masters leaderboard Friday despite not hitting a ball in anger in his second round. The 45-year-old American was five-under-par after his opening round, but strong winds meant only three hours play was possible on the second day of the European Tour event. Overnight leader Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano of Spain bogeyed two of his first five holes before the suspension to slip back to four-under-par. Jason Day, who parred the six holes he managed and KJ Choi of Korea, another not get on the course, are also on four-under. With weather conditions not set to improve until Sunday, organizers have taken the decision to cut the tournament to 54 holes. \u201cIt was windy when we went out and I had a few birdie chances, but then I bogeyed two holes into the wind,\u201d Fernandez-Castano told the European Tour website. \u201cI hope tomorrow I can take advantage of the remaining ten holes I have. I didn\u2019t have any balls moving, but certain shots you could hardly keep balanced. Being selfish I\u2019m quite happy play was called off.\u201d Tournament director David Propyn said he had been left with a difficult decision.  \u201cThe course is still on the verge of playable, but there\u2019s no point sending the guys out for an hour or two on a marginal course,\u201d he said. Former Open Champion Daly is seeking his first victory in eight years and has slipped to 543rd in the world rankings. World No.2 Lee Westwood struggled in the conditions, following a birdie on the 11th with a double bogey on the next and a further dropped shot saw him slip back to one over. He is tied in joint 48th with former U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell. South African Branden Grace, a back to back winner this season on home soil, again showed his mettle with four birdies in six holes to go to one-under-par, while Ireland\u2019s Damien McGrane went to the turn in five-under 31, but he started with a 78. Many of the field will be heading Monday to Dubai for the third leg of the \u2018Desert Swing\u2019.  "

        "content": "Two-time Formula One champion Fernando Alonso set his sights on a title charge in 2012 Friday as Ferrari unveiled the radical design of their car for the new season. The F2012, Ferrari\u2019s 58th F1 car, features a dramatic steeped-nose look in order to conform to new regulations regarding the height of the front chassis. Spain\u2019s Alonso finished 2011 fourth in the drivers\u2019 standings, 135 points behind Red Bull\u2019s double world champion Sebastian Vettel, after claiming just one race win at the British Grand Prix. \u201cIt looks very different from what we have seen in the last two years,\u201d Alonso said at the launch, which was originally scheduled to take place Thursday but was pushed back 24 hours due to heavy snowfall. Can Senna restore the romance to Formula One? \u201cMy third season at Ferrari and I am going to start with the same strength and determination. I want to do great. \u201cOf course it will be quite competitive for the whole season, but we want to see red cars on the podium. We start next week in Jerez and we keep working together. I am sure we will do well this year.\u201d Ferrari have won a record 16 constructors\u2019 titles and the Italian marque have clinched 15 drivers\u2019 championships \u2013 more than any other team. But a disappointing campaign last year saw them finish third in the standings, 122 points adrift of McLaren and a massive 275 points behind double constructors\u2019 championship winners Red Bull. \u201cI believe in the skills we have here in Ferrari,\u201d former McLaren driver Alonso said. We have two months to get ready before the first competition. New car gives McLaren confidence \u201cWe have to fight for the title and try and get as many points as possible. We really want to be right at the top of the ranking. \u201cWe have to be as consistent and resolute as possible and I am sure, really, really sure we will be able to get great targets and great responsibility for driving for Ferrari.\u201d Alonso\u2019s teammate Felipe Massa also endured a frustrating season, but the Brazilian is confident the new car can fire Ferrari to success. \u201cLet me tell you that it looks really, really aggressive,\u201d said Massa. \u201cThis was part of my dreams. I know there was quite a lot of brainstorming when it comes to the new car. \u201cWe always wanted to develop new models so I am impressed with the new car. We start in a few days and I am sure the championship will be stunning and very competitive.\u201d Ferrari were not the only team showing off their new car Friday. Silverstone-based Force India had drivers Paul di Resta and Nico Hulkenberg on hand to reveal the VJM05. Britain\u2019s Di Resta, the cousin of IndyCar legend Dario Franchitti, enjoyed a successful rookie season with the Indian-owned team, collecting 27 points to finish 13th in the drivers\u2019 championship. \u201cSeeing the new car built and complete for the first time is always an exciting moment,\u201d the 25-year-old said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a good winter and I\u2019ve recharged my batteries, but now I\u2019m fully focused on 2012 and looking forward to the start of testing.  \u201cThere\u2019s a really positive feeling in the team, good stability and hopefully we can pick up where we left off at the end of last year.\u201d German driver Nico Hulkenberg has taken the place of compatriot Adrian Sutil, who was handed an 18-month suspended jail sentence earlier this week for injuring Eric Lux \u2013 the chief executive of Lotus\u2019 parent company Genii Capital. \u201cPreparations for the new season have been full-on with simulator sessions and lots of fitness training,\u201d said Hulkenberg, who last raced for Williams in 2010.  \u201cI feel ready to get back to racing and I\u2019m excited to find out what the new car feels like next week.\u201d Elsewhere, veteran Indian driver Narain Karthikeyan has returned to Spanish team HRT. The 35-year-old\u2019s recruitment means all 24 places on the grid for the 2012 season have now been filled. Karthikeyan took part in the first eight races of 2011 with the Madrid-based team before making way for young Red Bull prospect Daniel Ricciardo. He last raced at the inaugural Indian Grand Prix in October. \u201cIt has taken a lot of hard work to make this happen but I am absolutely elated to feature on the 2012 grid with HRT F1 team,\u201d the former NASCAR racer said.  \u201cI was pleased with our strong performance at the Indian Grand Prix, in front of my passionate home fans and I look forward to building on this result in 2012. \u201cI have been training hard since the end of 2011, ensuring I was ready for the rigors of F1 if an opportunity arose.\u201d The 2012 Formula One season will begin with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on March 18.

        "content": "John Terry has been stripped of the captaincy of England\u2019s national soccer team due to his court case over charges of alleged racial abuse, which starts in July. However, the English Football Association said that the Chelsea defender would still be able to play at the Euro 2012 finals, which will finish before the hearing begins on July 9. Terry\u2019s lawyer entered a not guilty plea at Wednesday\u2019s initial court visit, when the judge decided it would be better to start the case after the tournament because Chelsea\u2019s submission said key players would not be available as witnesses until then. \u201cThe Board has discussed the matter in detail and has collectively decided it is in the interests of all parties that John has the responsibilities of captaincy removed at this time,\u201d the FA said in a statement on Friday. \u201cThis decision has been taken due to the higher profile nature of the England captaincy, on and off the pitch, and the additional demands and requirements expected of the captain leading into and during a tournament.\u201d The FA said the decision in no way suggests that Terry is guilty of making racial comments to Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand during a Premier League match last October. When Chelsea and QPR met again in an FA Cup tie last weekend, the FA canceled the traditional pre-match handshake to defuse any tensions between the players. The FA said it had explained the decision to Terry and national coach Fabio Capello, who was not part of the discussions.  The Italian can select the 31-year-old for England\u2019s next game against the Netherlands on February 29 and the Euro 2012 tournament in Poland and Ukraine from June 8-July 1. Terry has represented his country 72 times, first becoming captain after the 2006 World Cup. Ferdinand\u2019s older brother Rio said on Friday that he did not want to replace Terry as captain, as he did two years ago. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be England captain after the last episode, just want to concentrate on playin for utd&if I make the squad then as ever I\u2019ll be delighted,\u201d the Manchester United player wrote on social networking website Twitter. Terry will keep his role as Chelsea captain, according to his manager Andre Villas-Boas. \u201cIt\u2019s really an FA decision. I have nothing to say about it. I don\u2019t agree with it,\u201d the Portuguese coach told reporters ahead of Sunday\u2019s Premier League match against Manchester United, which Terry will miss due to a knee injury.  \u201cThe statement from the FA was pretty clear on what was their decision-making. John will continue to be our captain. It (the trial) doesn\u2019t compromise on my decision-making. It obviously compromises on the FA\u2019s decision-making.\u201d The FA\u2019s decision was backed by the British government, the UK Press Association reported. \u201cI completely support the FA\u2019s decision,\u201d Sports minister Hugh Robertson said. \u201cIt would have been impossible for John Terry to have continued as captain with this charge over his head.\u201d"

        "content": "A British Cabinet minister said Friday he is resigning after authorities announced he faces charges in connection with a speeding offense he allegedly blamed on his ex-wife.  Both Energy and Climate Secretary Chris Huhne and his ex-wife, Vicky Pryce, will be charged, Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said in a televised statement. The Liberal Democrat member of the coalition government said he would resign from his Cabinet post to defend the case in court.  Huhne told reporters it was \u201cdeeply regrettable\u201d that the Crown Prosecution Service had decided to bring charges of perverting the course of justice . \u201cI\u2019m innocent of these charges,\u201d he said. \u201cI intend to fight this in the courts and I\u2019m confident the jury will agree.\u201d Huhne said he was stepping down as energy secretary in order to avoid any distraction from the department\u2019s work, although he will continue to represent his constituents in parliament. Liberal Democrat lawmaker Ed Davey is to take over as energy secretary. Huhne has repeatedly denied the allegations against him. Essex Police referred the case to the Crown Prosecution Service in July last year after investigating a complaint made in May. \u201cWe have concluded that there is sufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against both \u2026 for perverting the course of justice,\u201d Starmer said. Between March and May 2003, Huhne \u201chaving allegedly committed a speeding offense, falsely informed the authorities that Pryce was the driver in question, and she falsely accepted that she was the driver,\u201d Starmer said. A court appearance is scheduled for February 16 in London. The offense of perverting the course of justice carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and/or a fine. Huhne has been the member of Parliament for the Eastleigh constituency in Hampshire since 2005, and was a member of the European Parliament for the same area for the six years before that, according to his government department\u2019s website. Before entering politics, Huhne worked as a financial and economic journalist for nearly two decades."

        "content": "Eastern and central Europe continue to shiver under a blanket of heavy snow Friday, with more deaths reported after bitter cold overnight temperatures. Ukraine is probably the worst affected, with Poland, Romania, Serbia and Belarus also suffering much more severe winter conditions than usual. Thirty-eight people have died of hypothermia in Ukraine over the past 24 hours, the state-run news agency Ukrinform reported Friday morning, citing government ministries. The latest deaths take the total number killed in Ukraine in the cold spell that started January 27 to 101, the news agency said. Meanwhile, temperatures in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, continue to plummet. Friday morning\u2019s lows dipped to 27 degrees below zero Celsius (17 degrees below zero Fahrenheit), and it was the ninth day in a row that temperatures had dropped below minus 15 degrees Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit). Twenty-nine people had died in Poland as of Thursday, according to the publicly funded Polish Radio\u2019s news website. Other cold-related deaths have been reported in Serbia, Romania and elsewhere in the past week. Are you there? Share your story with iReport Joe Lowry, spokesman for the International Red Cross Europe Zone, said many people across the region are in urgent need of help. \u201cIf 163 people have frozen to death on the European streets, it is a disaster,\u201d he told CNN. The homeless and elderly are among the most vulnerable, Lowry said, as well as those who often find themselves on the margins of society, such as alcoholics or people with mental health issues. He said the Red Cross is helping people by providing warm clothing, boots, hot drinks and food, as well as shelter in heated tents and moral support. Local authorities must also react effectively to the crisis to save lives, he said.  The sudden start to the bitter cold weather after what had been a mild winter for some parts of Eastern Europe caught many people unaware, Lowry said. He added: \u201cThe human body is not designed to withstand temperatures of -32 degrees Celsius (about -25 degrees Fahrenheit). If you are not well nourished, if you don\u2019t have the right clothes to wear, if you don\u2019t have shelter, you cannot possibly stand them for long.\u201d The International Red Cross has released just over \u20ac108,000 ($141,000) from its disaster relief fund to help deal with the emergency, with about one-third going to Belarus and two-thirds to Ukraine, an online statement says. More funds are needed to help pay for supplies, fuel for volunteers\u2019 vehicles and publicity to get information out to those in need, Lowry added. CNN meteorologist Mari Ramos said the challenge now faced by many people is that the cold spell is lasting so long. The first reports of heavy snow came from Romania on January 26, Ramos said. Now, although temperatures are becoming more moderate, the snowfall will be very heavy, particularly for Bosnia, Serbia, Hungary and Romania. Some areas could get an additional half meter (20 inches) of snow. Ramos advises people to be \u201cweather aware\u201d in how they dress, making use of layers and keeping dry if at all possible. In extreme temperatures of minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit) or lower, exposed skin can freeze in less than 30 minutes, she said \u2013 and even faster if clothing is wet. People should wear a hat and gloves, and cover their ears, nose and mouth to help them regulate their temperature, she said. A state of emergency has now been declared in 23 municipalities in Serbia because of the snow, the state-run news agency Tanjug reported Friday. Six people have died from the cold in Serbia, and one is missing and presumed dead, the news agency Tanjug quoted emergencies official Predrag Maric, of the country\u2019s interior ministry, as saying Thursday. About 11,500 people have been cut off from the world by heavy snowfall, Maric told the agency.  Europe\u2019s cold blast extends all the way to Africa, with rare snow falling in parts of the Sahara Desert in Algeria and Morocco, said CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. More snow is expected this weekend for some areas that see snow fewer than once a decade.  Cold and snow warnings stretch from Portugal to Finland, with 25 countries posting warnings, Miller said.  It\u2019s been snowing in central Italy for almost a week and there is more forecast for the next two days. Ferrari\u2019s plans to unveil a new car for the 2012 Formula One season Friday were dashed by heavy snowfall at the Italian team\u2019s Maranello factory. The legendary brand had planned to showcase the new car, which they hope will win them a first drivers\u2019 championship since 2007. Eastern England will see significant snowfall this weekend, including London which could see 5 to 10 centimeters (2 to 4 inches) accumulate.  Temperatures will rebound this weekend in Eastern Europe, but a significant snowstorm will make travel conditions treacherous from the Aegean Sea all the way to Moscow, Miller added."

        "content": "Its windows are boarded up, the red-painted exterior is peeling and the roof could do with re-tiling \u2013 but this derelict house in a village in the Borinage region of Belgium was once the home of Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh.  The house and surrounding industrial area, in the village of Petit Wasmes, might not look too impressive, but it was here that Van Gogh decided to become an artist. Now local authorities have agreed a deal with the owner of the house to rent it for 27 years, with the aim of turning it into a museum and possibly a guest-house, in time for the city\u2019s partnership with neighboring Mons, the European Capital of Culture in 2015.  An exhibition covering Van Gogh\u2019s time in the region is planned for the Mons Museum of Fine Arts, while a documentary exploring the artist\u2019s life as an evangelical preacher among the mining community there is also in the works, with the house sure to feature.  \u201cThere is [currently] no one living in the house,\u201d said Gregory Dufert, a spokesperson for the municipality of Colfontaine. \u201cYou have four walls, you have something that looks like a roof and that\u2019s it.\u201d The municipality plans to fully restore the house, so that it will eventually look as it did when Van Gogh lived there.  It is an important cultural resource to the local area, said Dufert.   \u201cWe are a very poor region and it\u2019s really amazing to know that someone as celebrated as Vincent van Gogh stayed there,\u201d he said.  According to Teio Meedendorp, an expert on Van Gogh at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, local people in the Borinage still \u201chave a lot of sympathy for Vincent himself, because he had an eye for their needs and troubles.\u201d   Van Gogh\u2019s humanistic side was developed during this time and he even tried to endure the same hardships as the impoverished miners, said Meedendorp.  But it was when he was discharged from his job as a preacher that he made the decision, on the advice of his brother, to become an artist.  \u201cIt was a struggle to make this decision and he had to work really hard, which is what he did \u2013 he drew hundreds and hundreds of drawings before he saw himself fit to be an artist,\u201d said Meedendorp.  Few of these early sketches survive, but a drawing entitled \u201cMine workers in the snow\u201d from 1880 and in the collection at the Kroller-Muller Museum in Otterlo, the Netherlands, depicts workers trudging towards a mine which looms darkly in the background.   In a letter to his brother in 1880, Van Gogh said of the drawing: \u201cI have made a hasty scribble of miners and haulers (both boys and girls) going to the shaft in the morning through the snow, by a path along a thorn hedge; passing shadows, dimly visible in the twilight.\u201d According to Meedendorp, there is very little evidence left of Van Gogh\u2019s time in the Borinage, which is why the house is so important.  The area, too, is changing rapidly, with the mining industry now almost completely gone. \u201cI have a lot of sympathy for that region,\u201d said Meedendorp.  \u201cFrom the tourist point of view [the house] would help the region get some attention,\u201d he said.  Van Gogh lovers will hopefully be able to visit the restored house in 2015.  And for those who can\u2019t wait, an exhibition entitled \u201cVan Gogh Up Close\u201d opens at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in February, while the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam is currently focusing on Van Gogh\u2019s studio practice."

        "content": "Prince William has arrived in the Falkland Islands for a routine deployment as part of a four-man search and rescue crew, Britain\u2019s Ministry of Defence said Thursday. The prince will begin his Royal Air Force search and rescue duties after undergoing briefings and a familiarization flight, the ministry said in a statement. A six-week deployment to the Falklands is conventional for search and rescue pilots at this stage of their career, it said. \u201cFlight Lieutenant Wales will be deploying purely in an RAF role and will not be completing any ceremonial roles as the Duke of Cambridge,\u201d the ministry said.  However, the deployment has not been without controversy. This week, Argentina\u2019s foreign ministry criticized Britain over the matter.  \u201cPrince William is coming \u2026 as a member of the armed forces of his country,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. \u201cThe Argentinian people regret that the royal heir is coming to the soil of the homeland with the uniform of the conqueror and not with the wisdom of a statesman who works in the service of peace and dialogue between nations.\u201d Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982, prompting a war in which more than 600 Argentinian and 255 British troops died. After the war, the United Kingdom retained control of the islands, which are off Argentina\u2019s coast in the South Atlantic.  News of British plans to deploy the destroyer HMS Dauntless to the region did nothing to dampen the rhetoric from politicians in both countries. While British officials have said the ship\u2019s deployment is routine, according to Britain\u2019s ITN news network, some Argentinians see it as a provocation. British Prime Minister David Cameron has criticized Argentinian officials for their renewed claims to the island. \u201cWe support the Falklands\u2019 right to self-determination, and what the Argentinians have been saying recently, I would argue, is actually far more than colonialism, because these people want to remain British, and the Argentinians want them to do something else,\u201d he told lawmakers last month.  Demonstrators marching outside the British Embassy in Buenos Aires last month burned British flags and urged Argentina to sever ties with London.  Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has said the British \u201care preying on our natural resources, our oil, our fish\u201d in the Falklands, known as the Malvinas in Argentina. Fernandez\u2019s campaign has won some supporters. In December, members of the Mercosur trade bloc \u2013 which includes Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay \u2013 said they would stop ships bearing the Falkland Islands flag from entering their ports. The move angered some British officials. About 2,500 residents live on the islands, in addition to 1,700 people stationed at the British military\u2019s Mount Pleasant Complex there, according to the website of the islands\u2019 government."

        "content": "With recriminations and accusations flying in the wake of riots that left 79 football fans dead in the northeastern city of Port Said, the immediate future for Egyptian soccer looks particularly bleak. Three days of mourning have begun for the victims of the violence that erupted after local team Al-Masry had beaten Cairo-based Al-Ahly 3-1 on Wednesday, but it will take far longer than that to understand how such a tragedy could have occurred. The domestic league was suspended indefinitely after the deaths just hours before Prime Minister Kamal al-Ganzuri sacked the entire leadership of the Egyptian Football Association \u2013 a move that is sure to warrant attention from FIFA. Soccer\u2019s world\u2019s governing body stipulates that governments should not tamper with a national soccer federation\u2019s affairs, and an international ban for the Egyptian team could follow. Deadly Egyptian riots go beyond football FIFA president Sepp Blatter has expressed his sympathy to the victims\u2019 families and also asked for a detailed report on what happened.  Given the current confusion about exactly what did take place, he may be waiting a while. According to Al-Ahly board member, Khaled Mortagy, the security forces present in the stadium at Port Said have a lot to answer for. \u201cThere were huge, even massive security breaches at the game \u2013 the police showed total ignorance,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe fans moved like a tsunami, and quickly we were looking at a massacre. We believe that this is something that has been well organized. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are some hidden hands behind this.  But we can\u2019t really see or we cannot really confirm who is behind all that.\u201d In the wake of the tragedy, a number of Al-Ahly\u2019s players have said they are going to retire from the game, but Mortagy hopes they change their mind. Anger flares in Egypt after 79 die in soccer riot \u201c(The players) are in a very bad shape in terms of morale. They\u2019ve seen people die in the dressing rooms, which normally doesn\u2019t happen in the sports world. I think they have been under a lot of stress. \u201cAl-Ahly has over 60 million fans and supporters. And I don\u2019t think that the players will leave these fans because again the fans need them, and they need the fans.\u201d Blame has also been attached to the aging Port Said stadium, which hosted the fateful game between two of Egypt\u2019s biggest clubs. James Montague, author of \u201cWhen Friday Comes: Football in the War Zone,\u201d a book about football and politics in the Middle East, says many arenas in the country are not fit for the purpose. He told CNN: \u201cI\u2019ve been to many football grounds across Egypt. We\u2019re talking about stadiums built in the 1920s and 1930s, big crumbling concrete bowls that have few exits.  \u201cThey are death traps, and this is something that has been waiting to happen.  \u201cThere might be 70,000 allowed in a football stadium but 100,000 people come in, or 40,000 are supposed to be there and 70,000 people get in.\u201d Eyewitnesses: Police stood idle in Egypt football massacre There were flashpoints between fans when the teams played each other back in April, and Montague says it is inexplicable the authorities on hand at the stadium did not do more to protect fans. \u201cAt the moment everybody is wondering how and why the police allowed this to happen,\u201d he added. \u201cIn any country in the world, if you have a rivalry between two football teams, and you don\u2019t police it, there\u2019s likely to be a high degree of violence and probably deaths involved. \u201cIn this case, for some reason, the police stood back and didn\u2019t police the match properly.  \u201cObviously the soccer ultras (hardcore fans) had a key role in the revolution, fighting the police and trying to bring down Hosni Mubarak (former Egyptian leader)  \u2013 many people are questioning if that is the real reason this wasn\u2019t policed properly. \u201cThe league is a mess and I can\u2019t see it resuming anytime soon.\u201d"

Daly, who was playing his first tournament after a near six-week break from the game, battled strong gusts and swirling sand in Doha to shoot a bogey-free round of 67. The 55-year-old, who can boast two major titles, no longer holds a U.S. PGA Tour card, but made light of the tough conditions. \u201cI\u2019m pretty shocked,\u201d he told the European Tour\u2019s official website. \u201cI had five-and-a -half weeks off and really didn\u2019t touch a club much.

You feel like you are eating a lot of sand.\u201d The only man who had a better day than 1995 British Open winner Daly was Fernandez-Castano who recorded nine birdies alongside three bogeys. \u201cI would have taken level par,\u201d said Fernandez-Castano, who missed nearly six months of action last year due to a back injury. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t see the ball landing on the fairways and I just tried to keep it as low as possible. I think I just got lucky and holed some important putts. Putting is the most difficult thing on a windy day.\u201d Australian Jason Day and K.J. Choi, from Korea, are two shots back from Fernandez-Castano on four-under while five players were tied on three-under, including 1999 British Open champion Paul Lawrie. Why golf (and big business) still need Tiger Woods World number two Lee Westwood finished on one-under as did Europe\u2019s 2012 Ryder Cup captain, Jose Maria Olazabal, from Spain. Westwood took to social-networking site Twitter after his opening round to complain about slow play on day one. He said: \u201cTo say we are pros and there\u2019s no rough out there and we are supposed to know what we are doing, the pace of play today was a disgrace.\u201d He later added: \u201cI was referring to the general speed of play nearly every week now not any one person in particular. Same last week (in Abu Dhabi).\u201d"

        "content": "More deaths were reported in Eastern Europe on Thursday as the region continued to shiver in the grip of unusually frigid weather. The coldest temperatures continued to chill the Eastern European countries of Romania, Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, where Thursday was the coldest day yet for many. In Ukraine, 65 people have died since the bad weather started this week, according to the Ukranian Emergency Ministry. Of those, 47 were homeless. Others died in their homes or in hospitals as a result of frostbite and hypothermia.  Health officials say that more than 1,100 people have sought help for hypothermia and frostbite over the past six days, the state-run Ukrinform news agency reported, and more than 900 of them have been treated in hospitals. The authorities have opened more than 2,200 heated tents for people who do not have heating in their homes. Most schools in the capital, Kiev, are closed through the weekend. Temperatures there dipped to 25.5 degrees below zero Celsius (13.9 degrees below zero Fahrenheit) Thursday, the coldest night in 83 years, according to Ukrinform. Conditions in eastern Ukraine are among the toughest because high winds are common there, and it is a poor area. Many homes still have a Soviet-era heating system, which is prone to break down. Temperatures are expected to drop as low as 35 degrees below zero Celsius (31 degrees below zero Fahrenheit) overnight Thursday to Friday in parts of the country.  CNN International meteorologist Jennifer Delgado said eastern and central Europe are being hammered by a ridge of high pressure that is pulling in cold Siberian air. The trend will continue Friday, she said. In Poland, 29 people have died as a result of the freeze, the publicly funded Polish Radio\u2019s news website reported, up from only half that number a day earlier. Temperatures plummeted to 34 degrees below zero Celsius (29 degrees below zero Fahrenheit) in the Bieszczady mountains in southeastern Poland overnight, the website said. The country\u2019s southern, eastern and central provinces are most affected by the cold, with temperatures expected to fall even lower overnight into Friday. Some schools are closed because their heating is inadequate to cope with the conditions. Katarzyna Najorczyk, vice principal of a high school in Bydgoszcz, said, \u201cKids\u2019 safety and health is the most important.\u201d Police are continuing to search for homeless people to take them to shelters. In Szczecin, Arkadiusz Oryszewski of the Phenix Association said, \u201cDuring the last days of cold weather, our team had to go out to bring new people every two hours. Only tonight, seven people were brought, and this morning we have three men so far.\u201d  Six people have died from the cold in Serbia, and one is missing and presumed dead, the Serbian state-run news agency Tanjug quoted emergencies official Predrag Maric, of the country\u2019s interior ministry, as saying. About 11,500 people have been cut off from the world by heavy snowfall, and a state of emergency has been declared in 14 municipalities, Maric told the agency. More icy rainfall and snow is expected. Temperatures in Bucharest, Romania, dropped below 21 degrees below zero Celsius (minus-6 Fahrenheit) for the fifth consecutive night Wednesday into Thursday, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. Romanian Transport Minister Anca Boagiu said, \u201cIt\u2019s a moment when we cannot play games with nature, but we have to respect the force of nature. We have to protect ourselves and our families.\u201d In western Turkey, heavy snow is expected to continue through Friday morning. Some city administrations sent workers home. Temperatures in the capital, Ankara, dipped to 19 degrees below zero Celsius (minus-2 Fahrenheit), and snow continued to fall there as well as in Istanbul.  Farther west, much of central and northern Italy has been blanketed by unusually heavy snowfall. Air and road travel has been disrupted, and many professional soccer games have been canceled because of the bad weather. CNN iReporter Luca Martini said heavy snow had fallen in the northern Italian city of Ferrara. The 12-centimeter (5-inch) snowfall is quite unusual for the area, he said, and is causing traffic problems. Miller said a strong high-pressure area \u2013 named \u201cDieter\u201d by the Free University of Berlin, which has responsibility for naming highs and lows in Europe \u2013 is currently bringing down the frigid Siberian air and keeping Europe in the teeth of its worst cold spell in years. The heart of the cold air is now migrating slightly to the north, he said, and the most extreme temperatures will probably be found in the Baltic states and eastern Scandinavia as the week goes on.  An area of low pressure moving in from the Mediterranean will help the temperatures rebound somewhat in eastern and southeastern Europe, Miller said, but the system will bring heavy snow and storms, which will make travel even more treacherous.

Milan trail Juve by a point at the top but the leaders have a game after their match at Parma on Tuesday night was called off due to  snow. Third-placed Udinese took advantage to cut the gap to three points with a 2-1 win at home to Lecce while fourth-placed Lazio are now just two points behind after their fine win. Milan\u2019s match in the capital saw them force the early pace but in the second half Lazio came more into the match and 14 minutes from time Hernanes was put through and he hooked the ball home. Tommaso Rocchi\u2019s late second sealed the three points for Lazio to boost their title hopes. Diego Milito scored all four Inter goals at the San Siro, but his team could not seal the three points as Fabrizio Miccoli grabbed a hat-trick for the visitors. The snow-covered pitch made for an exciting game and Milito twice put them ahead in the second half only for Josip Ilicic to play in Miccoli to complete his treble and equalize for the final time. In the Copa del Rey,  Barcelona were held 1-1 at Valencia in their semifinal first leg tie in the Mestalla.

        "content": "The search of underwater areas of the wrecked cruise ship Costa Concordia has been suspended for safety reasons, the head of Italy\u2019s civil protection agency said Thursday. Franco Gabrielli, who is directing the salvage operation, made the announcement after meeting with technical experts. The search of the parts of the ship currently lying underwater will \u201cresume in later stages, once the operations of de-bunkering\u201d \u2013 removal of oil \u2013 \u201cand internal cleaning have created the conditions that can guarantee security,\u201d he said in a written statement. Rescue workers have already inspected 98% of the portion of the ship resting above water, Gabrielli said, adding that the search there and in the waters extending 18 square kilometers (7 square miles) around the ship will continue. A total of 15 people remain missing after the cruise ship\u2019s collision with rocks off Giglio Island on the coast of Tuscany on January 13. Seventeen bodies have been recovered. There were about 4,200 people on the cruise liner when it crashed. Franco Schettino, captain of the Costa Concordia, said that after the ship hit the rocks, he ran it aground off Giglio Island to keep it from sinking and limit the tilting. It came to rest on its starboard, or right, side, with roughly 50% of the ship under water. It is currently rotated nearly 90 degrees. Underwater operations have previously been temporarily suspended for safety reasons, but have always resumed. Officials have been particularly concerned for divers who have been searching submerged areas of the ship amid a sea of debris that includes heavy items and wires. Gabrielli also met with the people of Giglio on Thursday, amid worries over the lasting environmental effects of the disaster.  He told them planning for the removal of the ship from rocks has started, and that Costa Cruises, which ran the cruise, has given its commitment that it will work toward a plan that will cause the least environmental impact possible. The siphoning off of fuel will resume as soon as the weather conditions allow it, Gabrielli said. A final decision will be taken on a plan to remove the debris and waste water from the ship next week, the statement said. Costa Cruises said in a statement that it was \u201cworking with the utmost commitment and speed on the plan to remove the ship itself, fully aware that this is a priority to protect the environment on Giglio and the island\u2019s tourism.\u201d Costa is working with technical experts on the best way to deal with the enormous wreck, the statement said.  It has also invited 10 leading salvage companies around the world to put forward a plan to remove the hull of the Costa Concordia. The best one will be selected by the end of March, the company said. Gabrielli said earlier this week that if the ship does not slip into deeper water, it will take at least seven to 10 months to remove the wreckage. And that process won\u2019t begin until after the fuel is removed, which could take 28 working days. In the meantime, there will be no fishing, diving, snorkeling, or other normal use of the water near the wreckage, extending the disaster\u2019s economic toll. Meanwhile, Schettino is under house arrest on suspicion of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still on board.  He denies the charges, saying his actions saved lives. Schettino has admitted to prosecutors, defense attorneys and a judge that he made a \u201cmistake\u201d in colliding with the rocks off shore. But he has brushed aside suggestions that he was going too fast, as prosecutors allege. The lead prosecutor in the case is asking that Schettino be sent back to jail. A hearing has been scheduled for February 6. Schettino\u2019s lawyer says he should be released from house arrest. A number of survivors have filed lawsuits against Costa Cruises.  Costa has announced it was offering each of about 3,200 passengers who had been aboard the vessel a lump sum of 11,000 euros ($14,400), in compensation for their loss of property and emotional distress, as well as a refund of costs associated with the cruise. Separate agreements will be reached with those passengers who were injured and needed treatment and with the families of those who died, Costa said."

        "content": "Spain has won a major victory in its long court battle with a Florida-based deep-sea salvage company over rights to an estimated $500 million in silver and gold coins, officials said Wednesday.      The treasure was recovered in 2007 from a 19th century sunken ship off the Spanish coast.     The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on Tuesday turned aside another motion from the U.S.-based company, Odyssey Marine Exploration, and Spanish officials said they now expect the coins \u2013 nearly 600,000 of them \u2013 to arrive in Spain soon.      \u201cWith the ruling by the appeals court, the process begins to recover all of the coins taken illegally\u201d from the sunken ship, Spain\u2019s Culture Ministry said in a statement.      Odyssey, which can still appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, said in a statement, \u201cCurrently, no final order has been issued in the case and it would be premature to comment at this time.\u201d      The battle royal began after Odyssey announced in 2007 it had found the sunken treasure. It quickly laid claim to the coins, put them in crates and said it flew them to a discreet, well-guarded location in the United States.      Spain soon filed suit in a federal court in Tampa, Florida, also claiming the treasure.      Spain says its navy warship Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes was carrying the coins. The Mercedes, a 34-gun frigate, left Peru in 1804 and crossed the Atlantic to within a day\u2019s sail from Spain when British ships attacked the Spanish fleet.      In the ensuing Battle of Cape St. Mary, south of Portugal, the Mercedes exploded after being hit in its power magazine, according to the Spanish government\u2019s filing to the Florida court.       The federal court in Tampa in 2009 ruled in favor of Spain\u2019s claim to the treasure, but Odyssey took the case to the federal appeals court in Atlanta, which ruled last September to uphold the lower court\u2019s ruling.      At the end of that 53-page ruling, the three-judge appeals panel wrote, \u201cFor the foregoing reasons, the district court did not err when it ordered Odyssey to release the recovered\u201d items to the custody of Spain, according to a copy of the order viewed by CNN.      Since then, Odyssey has filed various motions at the appeals court to overturn or delay the ruling, said James Goold, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who is representing Spain in the case.      But on Tuesday, the appeals court denied an Odyssey motion, the court\u2019s chief deputy clerk, Amy Nerenberg, told CNN by phone from Atlanta.     Goold, who spoke to CNN by phone from Washington, said it appears that Odyssey\u2019s only possible appeal now would be to the U.S. Supreme Court. That court agrees to hear only a tiny portion of the cases presented to it.      The appeals court is expected to send the case in the coming days back to the federal court in Tampa, which would establish and supervise the procedures for sending the coins to Spain, Goold said.        Spain believes that the main part of the nearly 600,000 coins are currently in Florida, Goold said.        Spain\u2019s Culture Minister, Jose Ignaico Wert, told CNN in Madrid on Wednesday that the case was never really about the money.        \u201cWe\u2019re not going to use this money for purposes other than artistic exhibition, but this is something that enriches our material, artistic capital and it has to be appreciated as such,\u201d Wert said in an interview.        He said the coins would be exhibited in Spanish museums.        Peru has also followed this case. The silver and gold came from Latin America when Peru was a Spanish colony.     \u201cFormally, they haven\u2019t claimed anything, but we are completely open to consider the possibility of distributing some part of the treasure also among the Latin American museums,\u201d Wert said.      The treasure includes a vast trove of coins, included fabled \u201cpieces of eight,\u201d some minted in 1803 in Lima, Peru, Spanish officials said at a 2008 news conference.      The treasure already has crossed the Atlantic ocean twice \u2013 by ship in 1804 and then by plane in the other direction just a few years ago. Spanish officials hope it might finally arrive now for the first time on the Spanish mainland."

The work offers art-lovers a tantalizing hint of what the model for the world\u2019s most famous painting really looked like. Conservators found the portrait hidden beneath layers of black overpainting during restoration work on a picture initially thought to have been a later replica of the \u201cMona Lisa.\u201d The restored version shows the same woman that Leonardo depicted, against a landscape similar to that shown in the background of the original, which now hangs in the Louvre in Paris. And while the features of Leonardo\u2019s subject have been dulled by centuries of dirt and layers of cracked varnish \u2013 which are unlikely ever to be removed \u2013 in the recently-rediscovered copy, she appears fresher faced and younger than her better-known \u201ctwin.\u201d News of the find was revealed at a symposium at London\u2019s National Gallery, linked to its blockbuster \u201cLeonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan\u201d exhibition, and reported in the Art Newspaper. \u201cThis sensational find will transform our understanding of the world\u2019s most famous picture,\u201d the Art Newspaper reported, adding that the underdrawing found on the Madrid version \u201csuggests that the original and the copy were begun at the same time and painted next to each other, as the work evolved.\u201d Miguel Falomir, curator of Italian painting at the Prado, told a press conference at the museum expert analysis suggested a strong link between Leonardo and the artist who painted the copy. \u201cThe painting was done in the painter\u2019s own workshop,\u201d he was quoted by AFP as saying.  \u201cIt is absolutely consistent with Leonardo\u2019s work,\u201d he said, but he added: \u201cIt is a work in which Leonardo himself did not intervene.\u201d The painting is expected to be unveiled to the public at the Prado Museum later this month.

        "content": "Golf returns to Olympics in 2016 after a 112-year hiatus and some of the greatest names in the sport are battling to put their name to the new course on which the event is to be played. 18-time majors winner Jack Nicklaus, South Africa\u2019s Gary Player and Australia\u2019s Greg Norman are well past their playing primes but the three legends are among eight finalists in the running to design the 18-hole course on which the Olympic golf tournament will be played in Rio de Janeiro in four years time.  Gary Player Design, Greg Norman Golf Course Design and Nicklaus Design join Hawtree Ltd., Hanse Golf Design, Renaissance Golf, Robert Trent Jones II and Thomson-Perret Golf Course Architects in the competition to design the course that will be built in the Barra da Tijuca area of Rio, the part of the city that will host the largest number of Olympic venues.  The winner was scheduled to be announced by Rio Games organizers Friday. In soliciting bids for the course, Olympic organizers stipulated that it be available as a place for the public to play once the games end. \u201cAfter the Games, the course will be managed by a private operator with the chief purpose of promoting golf in Brazil and South America, representing one of the most important Games\u2019 legacies for sport development in the country,\u201d organizers said. For a nation of more than 200 million, Brazil has about 100 golf courses, many of those only nine holes. In contrast, South Carolina has more than four times that many courses with a population that\u2019s just 2% of Brazil\u2019s. Nicklaus said the Olympic course can build golf in Brazil and across much of the world. \u201cI think the Olympics is the greatest thing that could happen to golf on an international basis,\u201d the American said in 2010, because it means governments will support the game by building courses that young people have access to, and some of those young people will turn to golf in search of glory. \u201cAll the other parts of the world, if you look at the kids when they grow up, they don\u2019t know about the Masters or the British Open or the PGA. They know about a gold medal. And the gold medal is the best you can get in a sport,\u201d Nicklaus said. \u201cWe have one chance for golf as an Olympic sport to stay in the Olympics. \u2026 So we\u2019ve got to put our best foot forward. We\u2019ve got to get the best golf course.\u201d In an interview with the Golf Channel, Norman emphasized the big responsibility taken on by whoever gets the Rio contract. \u201cWhoever gets the golf course design job, they have to be the spokesperson for golf in the Olympics, because golf is only in for 2016. It hasn\u2019t been voted in for 2020.  \u201cSo whoever gets the job has to be beating the drum for the game of golf for the IOC for four years after that. They have to be a staunch proponent of the game of golf,\u201d Norman said. And Norman echoed Nicklaus on the accessibility of the course. \u201cIt has to be a course built for the general public at the end of the day. It can\u2019t be a private golf club,\u201d Norman said. On his website, Player said he sees the Olympic course as an opportunity to grow the game around the world. \u201cThe Olympics will expose millions of people in non-traditional golf markets to the game, and that is great for the sport,\u201d Player said. \u201cThis facility can, and should be, a catalyst for golf in Brazil long after the Olympic competition is complete.\u201d Whichever group wins the Olympic bid, Norman says, they won\u2019t be doing it to make money. And that\u2019s true. Organizers will pay $300,000 for the course design. Golf was last an Olympic event at the 1904 games in St. Louis, with Canada\u2019s George Lyon winning the gold medal. Golf was also played at the 1900 Games in Paris. There was no women\u2019s competition in golf in those games, but there will be in Rio. When making a pitch to Olympic organizers to include golf for 2016, a younger LPGA star, Hawaii\u2019s Michelle Wie, emphasized what it could mean to kids. \u201cFor so many boys and girls around the world, their heroes have been Olympic athletes. Until today, I never thought there was any chance that I could share in that dream,\u201d Wie said. "

        "content": "Sub-zero temperatures continued to keep eastern Europe in their grip Wednesday, leading to the deaths of 31 people in Ukraine so far, emergency officials there said. For several days, unusually cold weather and snow have slammed Eastern Europe, as well as other parts of Europe and central and western Turkey. CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said the heart of the cold air was still centered over Eastern Europe Wednesday, including Russia, Romania, Belarus and Poland as well as Ukraine, with temperatures generally a couple of degrees lower Wednesday than the day before. The Romanian capital, Bucharest, saw a low of -23 degrees Celsius (-9.4 degrees Fahrenheit) early Wednesday, compared with an average low of -4 degrees Celsius (25 degrees Fahrenheit) at this time of year. Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kiev, was shivering at -22 degrees Celsius (-7.6 degree Fahrenheit), with the mercury expected to drop to -31 degrees Celsius (-23.8 degree Fahrenheit) during the night.  Most of the dead in Ukraine were homeless but some people died in their homes, the country\u2019s Emergencies Ministry said.  The death toll has risen sharply since two days ago, the ministry said. Almost 700 people have also been hospitalized with injuries related to the freeze.  In several regions of Ukraine, including Kiev, entire housing complexes have been left without electricity or heating because of power failures. Schools are likely to close Thursday as temperatures are expected to drop below -24 degrees Celsius (-11.2  degrees Fahrenheit), officials said. The Emergencies Ministry is doing everything possible to combat the weather and has set up 1,600 heating centers across the country to assist people without power or heating, it said.  Temperatures could drop at the weekend to -30 degrees Celsius (-22 degrees Fahrenheit) in the daytime, the ministry warned. The health ministry said most of the deaths had occurred in eastern Ukraine, in the city of Donetsk and adjacent towns and villages. In Poland, five people died overnight, taking the total number of deaths to 15 since the icy weather rolled in Friday, the publicly-funded Polish Radio\u2019s news website reported Wednesday. Most of those who died were homeless. Elsewhere, the bad weather was blamed for the sinking of a cargo ship carrying scrap metal off Turkey\u2019s Black Sea coast late Tuesday. Divers, helicopters and coast guard ships have been scrambled in an effort to find eight missing crew members from the Cambodian-flagged ship Vera. In Istanbul, Turkey\u2019s largest city, the municipality mobilized nearly 2,600 personnel and more than 870 vehicles to try to keep roads open, as snow reached depths of up to 38 centimeters (1.2 feet). The unusual snowfall forced the cancellation and delay of scores of flights, as visibility was occasionally reduced to less than 50 meters (164 feet) mid-morning Wednesday.  Istanbul also suspended its high-speed sea bus service, which ferries passengers up and down the Bosphorus Strait and stretches of the Marmara Sea. According to the Istanbul municipality\u2019s website, at least 378 homeless citizens have been brought to shelters and hotels to escape the freezing temperatures. One man died when he fell in a well that was covered by snow moments after having his photo taken in the record snow, the mayor\u2019s office said.   More snow and bitter cold temperatures are expected Thursday from Edirne to Istanbul, with the heaviest snowfall expected in the Marmara region. Turkey\u2019s cold spell is forecast to ease Friday. The cold air also pushed westward Wednesday, with Paris dipping to -5 degrees Celsius (23 degrees Fahrenheit). The French capital may not top the freezing mark until the middle of next week, said Miller. In Italy, several professional soccer matches have been canceled or postponed due to the icy weather, according to Italy\u2019s ANSA news agency. One weather-related death, that of a one-year-old child trapped in a car swept into a gully, has been reported in Siracusa, Sicily, the news agency said. The cold will not loosen its grip on most of continental Europe until next week, Miller said, although parts of southeastern Europe and the Balkans could see temperatures begin to moderate on Friday as a result of a low pressure system moving in from the Mediterranean Sea.  This system will also dump heavy snowfall in the Balkans, mirroring the recent snow storm which ushered in the cold blast for many locations in southeast Europe."

        "content": "The captain of the Italian cruise liner Costa Concordia \u201ccommitted a tragic error,\u201d but his crew did their best to evacuate the ship\u2019s 3,200 passengers, the last survivor found aboard said Wednesday. Manrico Giampedroni, one of the ship\u2019s officers, said he was on the darkened bridge with Capt. Francesco Schettino when the Concordia hit the rocks off the Mediterranean island of Giglio the night of January 13. He broke a leg as the liner rolled and was found 36 hours later in a half-flooded dining room, suffering from hypothermia.  \u201cAll of the members of the crew did their best. They made a good job, everybody,\u201d he told CNN before his release from the hospital. But, he said, Schettino \u201ccommitted a tragic error. Maybe he was too confident in his skills, and he relied too much on his knowledge of the ship.\u201d At least 17 people died when the Concordia ran aground and settled sideways on the sea bottom off Giglio, with half of the vessel still sticking out of the shallow water. Another 15 remained unaccounted for more than two weeks after the accident.  Giampedroni was the ship\u2019s purser, the officer in charge of passenger accommodations and food service. He also oversaw the evacuation that followed Concordia\u2019s grounding.  Schettino had invited him to the bridge to watch as he steered the ship past Giglio in what the captain called \u201ca salute\u201d to the island town, Giampedroni told reporters on his way out of the hospital. About a half-dozen people were on the bridge, which was darkened for night operations.  He said he thought the ship was passing too close to the island, \u201cbut the captain drives the ship. He knows very well where he should pass.\u201d  \u201cIn this occasion, we cannot say, \u2018Captain, we are too near the coast.\u2019 We cannot say that. In this case, it is best only to watch and nothing else.\u201d Schettino has said that after the impact, he ran the ship aground to keep it from sinking and limit its list. The captain is under house arrest on suspicion of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still aboard. He denies the charges, saying his actions saved lives and dismissing prosecutors\u2019 suggestions that he was going too fast. Critics have also questioned whether Schettino waited too long to give the order to abandon ship. Giampedroni said that decision was up to the captain \u2013 but once given, \u201cEveryone worked in the proper way.\u201d  \u201cConsider that the ship was leaning very fast, it was a little difficult for us to put the people in safe, on the life boats,\u201d he said. Most of the 3,000-plus passengers and the ship\u2019s crew of about 1,000 made it safely off the ship in less than two hours, he said.  Giampedroni told CNN that he was hurt when he was heading back to the muster stations where passengers assembled to leave the ship.  \u201cMuster station A was completely evacuated,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to check if there was anyone left on muster station B. When I was going there, in the restaurant, I had the accident. The ship was tilted, and it was easy to lose orientation.\u201d  Giampedroni was half-submerged in the chilly water flooding the restaurant when found. He said he survived by sipping at a soft drink that he caught as it floated by, since the contents had not been contaminated with salt water. "

        "content": "Former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki has fired Spanish coach Ricardo Sanchez after just two months and decided to return to working with her father Piotr. The Dane slipped to fourth in the WTA rankings after a quarterfinal exit at the recent Australian Open, where she once again failed to secure a first grand slam title. Troels Christensen, a journalist with the Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet, told CNN how Sanchez had struggled to penetrate the close bond Wozniacki enjoys with her Poland-born father. \u201cCaroline and Piotr are mentally very tight,\u201d Christensen said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to break into the circle. He is not the first one has experienced that. \u201cIt was more Piotr\u2019s idea than Caroline\u2019s and I don\u2019t think she ever got used to him. They had agreed that they should sit down after the Australian Open and discuss the situation.\u201d Christensen said the tactical advice Sanchez gave Wozniacki during last month\u2019s Melbourne grand slam appeared to be ignored by the 21-year-old.  \u201cHe must have seen that his input did not come out on the court. When the Danish press confronted Caroline with his analysis, she would not comment,\u201d Christensen said. \u201cI sensed when I got to Melbourne that something was wrong because the Wozniacki team are usually in good spirits, but they were not this time.\u201d Despite the split with Sanchez, Christensen stressed that there was still a high level of respect between the three. \u201cThey like him very much and they\u2019re good friends. In my opinion they should have been more clear about who should do what and who is entitled to do what before they started working together.\u201d Wozniacki\u2019s failure to capture a grand slam title during her spell at the top of the world rankings meant she faced constant questioning on the subject.  Christensen said Wozniacki is also now facing criticism from a vocal minority of Danish tennis fans who find it hard to identify with her lifestyle. \u201cThere is a part of the Danish population who are irritated by her and think that she is not very Danish, she\u2019s very Polish in her ways because of her father,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say, \u2018She is living in Monaco, not paying her taxes blah blah blah\u2026\u2019 But I think it\u2019s a minority, but they are very loud. If you see the forums and newspapers\u2019 websites, people are a little bit skeptical about her chances of winning a grand slam.\u201d Wozniacki will look to return to winning ways at this month\u2019s WTA tournament in Qatar, where last year she lost in the final. This year\u2019s entry list includes new No. 1 and Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka."

        "content": "Europe\u2019s leading clubs kept their powder dry in the January transfer window with a big reduction in the value of deals completed, according to figures released Wednesday. Spending by English Premier League clubs fell dramatically on the same period in 2011, totaling an estimated \u00a360 million ($95.1 million), a 70 per cent reduction in the record \u00a3225 million ($356.6 million) of the year before, said business advisory firm Deloitte. \u201cIt was it quite a sober month with sober spending, very much down from the year before,\u201d Mark Roberts, an analyst for Deloittes told CNN. \u201cThe Financial Fair Play rules introduced by UEFA, this is the first year where the figures are recorded by Europe\u2019s governing body, definitely had an impact on clubs,\u201d added Roberts. Under the rules, clubs must work towards breaking even by 2015 or face sanctions, but Roberts said that the pattern over the last nine years was for the January window to only account for around 20 per cent of total transfer spending. And with Manchester City\u2019s Carlos Tevez remaining at the English Premier League leaders, there was not the catalyst that sparked the extraordinary last-day spending of 2011 where Chelsea paid \u00a350 million ($79.2 million) for Fernando Torres and Liverpool used part of the money to purchase Andy Carroll for \u00a335 million ($55.5 million) from Newcastle. Blog: Does football need transfer windows? The biggest deal was the $14 million which took Kevin De Bruyne from Genk to Chelsea, with relegation battlers Queens Park Rangers the most prominent spenders as they signed strikers Djibril Cisse and Bobby Zamora on the final day of the window.      Outside of the EPL, one of the biggest deals saw Thiago Motta move to Paris Saint-Germain from Inter Milan for a fee in the region of 10 million euros ($13.1m). Qatari-backed PSG were linked with a move for Tevez as were both the Milan clubs in Serie A, but could not meet the price valuation placed on the Argentine striker. Tevez stays put on quiet final day of window Research by Deloittes suggested that overall spending in France\u2019s Ligue 1, Serie A and the German Bundesliga was in the range of \u00a347-48 million ($76 million) for each league. Spending was more even more limited in La Liga, an estimated \u00a38 million ($12.7 million), with neither Real Madrid or Barcelona adding big names to their star-studded squads. But Roberts said that although spending was down in January, we can expect the transfer market to be fueled by Euro 2012 with many players displaying their qualities to the big clubs. \u201cI think you could see a big uplift around a major tournament,\u201d he told CNN. Young talent will also come under the spotlight in the football competition at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London where the majority of players are under 23.     "

Spaeaking at Wednesday\u2019s launch of McLaren\u2019s new car, team principal Martin Whitmarsh vowed that drivers Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton would be given every chance to close the gap on double world champion Sebastian Vettel. \u201cThe 2012 season will be an important one for McLaren,\u201d Whitmarsh said ahead of McLaren\u2019s bid to win a ninth constructors\u2019 title \u2013 and first since 1998 \u2013 when the new season starts in Australia on March 18.  \u201cHaving finished second in the constructors\u2019 championship for the past two seasons, we\u2019re determined to mount a sustained, hard challenge for both world titles. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful car, and one we feel is the perfect platform from which to launch our assault on the world championship. We are well aware that Red Bull remains a very powerful and capable operation. \u201cWe have no room to be complacent \u2013 what you see today only scratches the surface of what we\u2019re planning to deliver to the track both from an engineering and operational point of view throughout 2012.\u201d Button was world champion with Brawn in 2009, and finished runner-up in the drivers\u2019 standings last year \u2013 trailing Vettel by 122 points. \u201cThis is a beautiful car,\u201d said the 32-year-old Englishman, a veteran of over 200 grands prix starts. \u201cMany of them that you will see will not be! \u201cI still think we had a very fast package last year \u2026 we were also able to continuously develop throughout the year to match Red Bull \u2013 and that shows that we have the knowledge, effort and resources to sustain our efforts across the course of a whole season. \u201cEveryone will be watching us very closely to see what progress we make during the preseason tests, but I genuinely believe we have every reason to feel optimistic about the progress we\u2019ve made and our competitiveness this year.\u201d Hamilton clinched McLaren\u2019s 12th drivers\u2019 crown in 2008, but had a troubled time last year. His campaign was blighted by multiple visits to the stewards\u2019 office and a highly-publicized spat with Ferrari\u2019s Brazilian driver Felipe Massa, and he had a high-profile split with pop star girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger. The 27-year-old matched compatriot Button with three race wins, but finished well off the pace in fifth overall.  \u201cI think we already had a very strong base to build upon,\u201d he said. \u201cJenson and I won six races with MP4-26 last year and I think we\u2019ve been able to retain all the strengths and the reliability of that design while also incorporating lots of improvements and new ideas into the new car. \u201cI get the feeling the MP4-27 is going to feel very new and exciting when we get to drive it for the first time.\u201d Button will be the first to experience the new car on Tuesday at the opening pre-season test event in Jerez, Spain. Ferrari and Red Bull will launch their 2012 models on Friday and Monday respectively."

        "content": "WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, under house arrest in Britain for more than a year, appeared at the UK Supreme Court on Wednesday to fight his extradition to Sweden. His lawyers argued a Swedish warrant for Assange\u2019s arrest is invalid because it was issued by a Swedish prosecutor, who they say is not an independent and impartial judicial authority. The warrant is an effort to bring Assange to Sweden to face questioning about accusations, unrelated to WikiLeaks, that he sexually assaulted two women in 2010. Assange has not been charged with a crime and has denied wrongdoing. The prosecution is expected to make its case at the Supreme Court on Thursday; a decision is not expected for weeks. Assange, who made no statement Wednesday, has been living at the Suffolk country mansion of one of his supporters since December 2010. He lost a court battle last November against extradition, but the High Court ruled in December that he could appeal. Assange\u2019s lawyers have vowed to take their fight all the way to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary. The extradition case is not linked to Assange\u2019s work as founder and editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, which has put him on the wrong side of U.S. authorities. The organization, which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information, has published some 250,000 confidential U.S. diplomatic cables, causing embarrassment to the government and others.  It has also published hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. documents relating to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. But the organization has come under increasing financial pressure in recent months, leading Assange to announce in October that WikiLeaks was temporarily stopping publication to \u201caggressively fundraise\u201d in order to stay afloat. While Assange waits for the Supreme Court to rule on his extradition, he plans to host a talk show on Russian TV. The Alyona Show, which appears on the Kremlin-funded, pro-Russian network Russia Today, said Wednesday that Assange will conduct interviews from the Suffolk mansion, with an electronic bracelet monitoring his movements. Assange will also voice a character in an upcoming episode of the animated series \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d the magazine Entertainment Weekly reported Wednesday."

        "content": "England soccer captain John Terry, who is accused of racially abusing another player during a match, will go on trial July 9 after his lawyers entered a plea of not guilty in a London Magistrate\u2019s Court on Wednesday. Terry did not appear in person for the hearing.  The trial date was set so far in the future because of Terry\u2019s football match commitments.  Grosvenor Law, which is representing the football player, said it will put forward a \u201cdetailed and robust\u201d defense, adding that Terry is \u201cshocked and disgusted\u201d by the accusation.  The case stems from comments the Chelsea footballer allegedly made to Queens Park Rangers player Anton Ferdinand in an English Premier League match last year.  Alison Saunders, chief crown prosecutor for London, said Terry is being prosecuted for a \u201cracially aggravated public order offense\u201d because of the comments during the October 23 match.  \u201cI am satisfied there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to prosecute this case,\u201d Saunders said in December.  The maximum penalty for the offense is \u00a32,500 ($3,900). The London-born defender denied the allegations.  \u201cMr. Terry has never racially abused another player in his entire career,\u201d his lawyers said Wednesday. Terry\u2019s club has also backed him up.  \u201cJohn has made it clear he denies the charge and is determined to do all he can to prove his innocence,\u201d the club said in a statement in December. \u201cChelsea FC has always been fully supportive of John in this matter and there is no question that we will continue to be so. Terry\u2019s position as England captain has come under scrutiny since the allegations were made, and the court case will come before the team\u2019s next match at home against the Netherlands on February 29. The English Football Association\u2019s former chief executive, David Davies, said the ruling body might take action later if Terry is found guilty. \u201cThe FA would most certainly go down that road,\u201d Davies said in December. \u201cEngland is the country which first embraced the idea of using the power of football to face racism back in the 1990s. England has not, unlike many other countries, swept this issue under the carpet. \u201cHe can most certainly still play for England, as things stand. You always start with the premise of innocence until proven guilty. He will, to be sure, fight these charges with a vehemence.\u201d In another case last year, Liverpool\u2019s Luis Suarez was suspended and fined for racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra. Suarez was suspended for eight matches and fined \u00a340,000 ($63,000), England\u2019s Football Association announced in December. Evra said Suarez repeatedly shouted a racial slur at him during the October 15 match and demanded that Suarez be held accountable. Suarez did not specify what he said, but said it wasn\u2019t offensive. And his club issued a statement saying  it was \u201cvery surprised and disappointed\u201d with the decision. Racist taunts, alleged and proven, have dogged English football for years.  On Saturday, police arrested a man on suspicion of making a racially abusive gesture at a high-profile soccer match between Liverpool and Manchester United earlier that day. Also in January, Merseyside police arrested a 20-year-old man on \u201csuspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offense\u201d following a Liverpool match against Oldham."

        "content": "The family of a Minnesota couple that remains unaccounted for after a massive cruise ship ran aground off an Italian island last month plans to hold a memorial service to celebrate their lives.  Gerald and Barbara Heil have been missing since the Costa Concordia hit rocks and ran aground off Giglio Island on January 13.  Relatives said they accept the decision to call off the search for missing passengers. A service is planned in the coming weeks, the family said in a statement.  \u201cWe are certainly disheartened to hear this news but understand and accept the decision to bring the search operation to a halt,\u201d the statement on the family website said.  \u201cWe cannot express enough our sincere gratitude to all those involved in the search and rescue effort.\u201d Their daughter said her mother had not traveled much until her father retired from the Minnesota Department of Agriculture. \u201cThey\u2019d been going a lot of places,\u201d Sarah Heil told Chicago\u2019s WBBM Radio. \u201cI was really happy because they deserved to go on this awesome trip they had planned.\u201d The Heils are from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. A total of 15 people remain missing after the cruise ship\u2019s collision off the coast of Tuscany with about 4,200 people aboard. Seventeen bodies have been recovered.  Franco Schettino, captain of the Costa Concordia, said after the ship hit the rocks, he ran it aground to keep it from sinking and limit the tilting. It came to rest on its right side with roughly 50% of the ship under water. It is currently rotated nearly 90 degrees. Salvage operations in the part of the ship above the water line will continue, salvage officials said, along with searches around the wreck. Underwater operations have previously been temporarily suspended for safety reasons, but have always resumed. Technical experts are advising they come to a permanent end.  Schettino is under house arrest on suspicion of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still aboard. He denies the charges, saying his actions saved lives. Schettino has admitted to prosecutors, defense attorneys and a judge that he made a \u201cmistake\u201d in colliding with the rocks off shore. But he has brushed aside suggestions that he was going too fast, as prosecutors allege. The lead prosecutor is asking that Schettino be sent back to jail. A hearing has been scheduled for Monday.  However, Schettino\u2019s lawyer says his client should be released from house arrest. A number of survivors have filed lawsuits against the company that ran the cruise, Costa Cruises.  Costa has announced it is offering each of about 3,200 passengers who had been aboard the vessel a lump sum of 11,000 euros ($14,400), in compensation for their loss of property and emotional distress, as well as a refund of costs associated with the cruise. Separate agreements will be reached with those passengers who were injured and needed treatment at the scene and with the families of those who died, Costa said."

        "content": "At first, Vivian Shafer said, she thought it was part of the magic show aboard her Mediterranean cruise. During the show, aboard the Costa Concordia, staffers had been \u201cplaying with the lights\u201d and using smoke, \u201cso we really weren\u2019t that alarmed\u201d as things began happening on the ship, she said Sunday.  Shafer said she and her traveling companion, Ronda Rosenthal, returned to their cabin after the ship gave a \u201cshudder,\u201d but were reassured by their cabin steward the ship was experiencing a \u201csmall technical difficulty.\u201d And as the two got into bed, someone speaking on behalf of the ship\u2019s captain made an announcement saying there was an electrical problem that would be fixed soon. However, it became clear that something was amiss aboard the 1,500-cabin luxury vessel, after the two heard announcements regarding lifeboats and muster stations. They dressed, grabbed their life jackets and went to investigate, coming upon a chaotic scene. \u201cWe peeked around the corner to kind of see what people were doing \u2026 and my gosh, people were actually getting in a lifeboat,\u201d Shafer said.  At least five people died after the Concordia ran aground on the tiny island of Giglio Friday night. Several others remained unaccounted for.  Survivors recounted a frantic rush by passengers to get on lifeboats, while the crew appeared helpless and overwhelmed to cope. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t anybody to help you,\u201d Shafer said. \u201cI mean, the passengers were loading the lifeboats by themselves.\u201d Carnival Corporation, the parent company of Costa Cruises, said in a statement Saturday that it was \u201cworking to fully understand the cause of what occurred. The safety of our guests and crew members remains the number-one priority of Carnival Corporation \u2026 and all of our cruise lines.\u201d Costa Cruises on Sunday said crew members on board the Concordia \u201cacted bravely and swiftly to help evacuate more than 4,000 individuals during a very challenging situation. We are very grateful for all they have done.\u201d  It said preliminary indications are that there may have been \u201csignificant human error\u201d on the part of the ship\u2019s captain. Compounding the evacuation problems was that only one side of lifeboats was available as the ship was listing. Passenger Laurie Willits, from Ontario, Canada, said some lifeboats on the higher side got stuck, leaving people suspended in mid-air amid the sounds of children crying and screaming. \u201cIt was so crowded, and there was no room for us,\u201d said Brandon Warrick, who was sailing with his siblings. They arrived late, he said Sunday, and \u201cit was just bad, like mad scrambles to get into the lifeboats. Nobody followed any procedure. The crew was yelling for people to wait their turn and pretty much it was just a giant every man for himself, to get onto the lifeboat.\u201d He said his family hung back because \u201cwe didn\u2019t want to make it worse.\u201d His sister, Amanda Warrick, said she thought several times that she might die, as they waited at least an hour and a half for more rescue boats after all the lifeboats departed.  As the ship took on water and listed to the side, \u201cWe were just holding onto the railing, trying not to fall,\u201d Brandon Warrick said. \u201cI just remember standing on the decks,\u201d Amanda Warrick said. \u201cThere were barely any people left.\u201d She said she didn\u2019t see any crew members \u201cuntil the very last minute\u201d and they were given no information about how long they would have to wait or whether any more help was coming. Her primary concern, she said, was staying with her brothers. \u201cThere was no way that we were going to be separated.\u201d Costa Cruises said Sunday its crew members hold a certificate in basic safety training and are trained to assist in emergency situations. Every two weeks, the company said, all crew members perform a ship evacuation simulation. Shafer said the only help they received from the crew was one young woman who approached her and told her to tighten her life vest. \u201cI was really disappointed and surprised,\u201d she said. \u201cThe crew was so young. You would have thought they could have handled it better.\u201d She said she thinks passengers should at least have been told to grab their coats, shoes and warm clothing. Rosenthal said she believes the two waited at least 40 minutes to get on a lifeboat. The two had just embarked at the Italian port of Civitavecchia, she said, and had not undergone the mandatory safety drill, scheduled for the next evening. However, she had just taken a cruise and so she knew where the life jackets were stored, she said.  \u201cLack of communication was a big thing for me,\u201d she said, \u201cand it wasn\u2019t the language barrier \u2026 it wasn\u2019t handled at all like the previous cruise I had been on.\u201d Even on shore, she said, people were wandering around aimlessly. She said once she and Shafer got on board a lifeboat, people were angry with them, as the boat was crowded. She did not clarify whether the crew members or other passengers were angry. Passenger Benji Smith on Saturday recounted making his own rope ladder to save himself and his wife. \u201cIt was the Marx brothers, watching these guys trying to figure out how to work the boat,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like the disaster itself was manageable, but I felt like the crew was going to kill us.\u201d After helping passengers, some said, crew members jumped overboard and swam ashore. Smith said even the safety presentation was more of a \u201csales pitch\u201d for shore excursions. "

        "content": "French lawmakers have asked the country\u2019s constitutional council to examine a new law that punishes the denial of genocide with fines and prison time.  The French Senate said Wednesday that 65 deputies and 76 senators supported the review to determine whether it is constitutional and legal.  Turkey, which has made no secret it was vehemently opposed to the French law, applauded the latest development, describing it as a \u201cvery esteemed initiative.\u201d  The law does not specifically mention the World War I massacre of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Armenians by Ottoman Turks. But most of the seven-hour debate in the French Senate on January 23 focused on the memory of the Armenian genocide. The Turkish government denounced the law after 127 senators voted in favor of it in the upper house of France\u2019s parliament last month.  Turkey\u2019s prime minister called it \u201ca massacre of freedom of thought\u201d and vowed to lobby for a petition of 60 French lawmaker signatures to block the law in France\u2019s constitutional council. According to the French legislation, \u201cthose who have publicly denied or trivialized crimes of genocide\u201d can face a year in prison and/or a fine of 45,000 euros. Within minutes of the vote in favor of the law in Paris, Armenia\u2019s foreign minister issued a statement of gratitude that declared France \u201ca genuine defender of universal human values.\u201d \u201cThis day will be written in gold,\u201d wrote Edward Nalbandian. Every year, Armenians around the world commemorate the 1915 slaughter of more than 1.2 million ethnic Armenians. The Turkish government rejects the term \u201cgenocide\u201d to refer to this dark and bloody chapter of history.  Many Turkish politicians and historians argue Muslim Turks were also massacred by Armenian militias in the final days of the Ottoman Empire. Instead, Ankara spends significant political capital and issues threats in an attempt to block initiatives in the U.S. Congress to formally recognize the Armenian genocide. After the French lower house of parliament passed the genocide law in December, Turkey temporarily withdrew its ambassador from Paris and suspended military ties with France. Turkish politicians have warned of further sanctions against France if President Nicolas Sarkozy allows the new law to go into effect. "

Despite not going anywhere, Manchester City\u2019s Carlos Tevez still managed to hog the headlines as he lodged an appeal with the English Premier League over his six-week fine ($1.6 million) for gross misconduct imposed by his club. The Premier League confirmed Tuesday that it had received correspondence from Tevez informing them of his intention to appeal.  The Argentine striker hasn\u2019t played for the Blues since he allegedly refused to take the field during a Champions League tie against Bayern Munich in September.  One Manchester City player who did manage to leave the Etihad Stadium was Wayne Bridge who has joined Sunderland on loan until the end of the season. The 31-year-old defender made just one appearance for Roberto Mancini this term and has played just 58 times for the club since he joined from Chelsea in 2009.    Bridge\u2019s former London employers announced Monday the signing of winger Kevin de Bruyne from Belgian side Genk for a fee of \u00a36.7 million ($10.5 million).  But the 20-year-old prospect will remain at the Belgian champions where he will play out the rest of the season on loan to gain more experience.  Heading out of Stamford Bridge is 18-year-old striker Philipp Prosenik, who has joined AC Milan for an undisclosed fee.  The Austrian under-19 international joined the west London club from Rapid Vienna in 2009 but hasn\u2019t done enough to impress new coach Andre Villas-Boas. Deadline-day: A football agent\u2019s inside story North London neighbors Tottenham Hotspur have loaned out Croatian defender Vedran Corluka to Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen until the end of the season.

Another Croatian on the move is Glasgow Rangers\u2019 striker Nikica Jelavic who joins Everton on a four-and-a-half year deal.  The 26-year-old striker joins short-term loan signing Landon Donovan (from LA Galaxy) and Darron Gibson who arrived for an undisclosed fee from Manchester United earlier in the month.

Also on his way to Loftus Road is Lazio striker Drijbril Cisse who returns to the Premier League after a three-year absence.  According to the Italian news agency Ansa, the former Liverpool and Sunderland striker has signed a two-and-a-half year deal worth \u20ac5 million ($6.5 million). Meanwhile in Italy, Inter Milan made three signings before Tuesday\u2019s deadline passed.  Colombian midfielder Freddy Guarin joins on a four-and-a-half year deal from Portuguese champions Porto. The 25-year-old Colombian forward is joined by Italy midfielder Angelo Palombo \u2013 on loan from Sampdoria with an option of making a permanent move at the end of the season \u2013 and 20-year-old defender Juan, who arrives from Brazilian club Internacional on a four-and-a-half year deal.

The 23-year-old Grace, who came through qualifying school last year to secure his tour card, posted a level par 72 for a 72-hole total of 270 (-18). And that proved just enough to keep Elson at bay, after the Englishman replicated his opening round 63 to come agonizingly close to ending his European Tour drought.  New heart gives golfer new hope It was a solid, if unspectacular, display from Grace, who held a three-stroke lead overnight.  In the end, a round consisting of 16 pars, with just one birdie and one bogey, proved enough for the Pretoria player, despite Elson\u2019s valiant effort to snatch victory. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true,\u201d Grace told the European Tour website. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to win in front of a home crowd and I wouldn\u2019t exchange it for anything else. \u201cIt was pretty tough out there today, I played really nicely and I hit the ball superbly.

Protesters calling for President Traian Basescu\u2019s resignation and early elections blocked traffic in the capital\u2019s University Square. Many waved flags with the centers ripped out to symbolize the 1989 communist revolution. Others carried signs reading \u201cLiberty\u201d and \u201cDown with President Basescu.\u201d Police fired tear gas in an attempt to calm the crowd. Several people were injured and taken to the hospital, including one police officer who suffered a head injury after demonstrators hit him with stones. The protests broke out Thursday after Deputy Health Minister Raed Arafat, an opponent of health reforms proposed by the government, resigned. Facing public pressure, Basescu decided to scrap the reforms Friday, saying he made the decision after realizing that a majority of those in the medical system opposed the change.  \u201cThe hospitals don\u2019t want the change, the (doctors) don\u2019t want the change and neither does the emergency health care system,\u201d Basescu said.   Critics had argued that the proposal favored the private health care system by allowing access to government funds while the state-funded system lacks financial aid.  Over the past three days, protesters held demonstrations in major cities around Romania, including Cluj, Timisoara, Iasi and Targu Mures.  The protests follow several unpopular measures taken by the government over the past two years. After receiving a loan of 20 billion euros from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union in 2009, the government cut salaries in the public sector by 25% a year later in order to enforce austerity measures recommended by the IMF.

        "content": "The captain of the ill-fated Costa Concordia may have made \u201csignificant\u201d errors that led to the vessel\u2019s wreck Friday and subsequent deaths of at least five people, the cruise line said late Sunday. \u201cThe route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore, and the captain\u2019s judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard Costa procedures,\u201d Costa Cruises said in a statement. The ship\u2019s captain, Francesco Schettino, was detained Saturday for alleged manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still on board, chief prosecutor Francesco Verusio told Italy\u2019s ANSA state news agency.  Schettino himself joined Costa Cruises as a safety officer in 2002 before being appointed captain four years later, the company said. First officer Ciro Ambrosio was being detained for questioning on similar charges, prosecutor Verusio said. Even with its admission that mistakes were made, the Genoa-based cruise company \u2013 whose parent firm, Carnival Corp., did not respond Sunday to requests from CNN for more information \u2013 defended the ship\u2019s crew in the face of criticism. \u201cIt is becoming clear that the crew of the Costa Concordia acted bravely and swiftly to help evacuate more than 4,000 individuals during a very challenging situation,\u201d the company said, adding all crew members are trained, and the passengers earlier took part in an evacuation drill. Survivors have described the scene \u2013 after the ship hit rocks near the island of Giglio, off the coast of Tuscany, and turned over on its side \u2013 as \u201cchaos.\u201d \u201cIt was just battling, mad scrambles,\u201d U.S. student Brandon Warrick said of the fight to board lifeboats, describing it as \u201ca giant every man for himself.\u201d His sister Amanda said she feared she was going to die as they waited for up to two hours for rescue.  \u201cWaiting was definitely the worst. Because we didn\u2019t know who was going to be coming, how much longer we would have to wait,\u201d she said.  Authorities have said at least 20 were injured due to the incident, in addition to those killed. That death toll includes two elderly people whose bodies were found, with their life jackets on, near one of the ship\u2019s restaurants, Italian Coast Guard spokesman Capt. Cosimo Nicastro told reporters Sunday. Hours earlier, crews rescued a ship employee trapped in a ship restaurant.  The man \u2013 an Italian purser whose name was not released \u2013 was suffering from hypothermia when rescue crews found him, said Commander Filippo Marini, a spokesman for the Port Authority of Porto Santo Stefano.  Earlier Sunday, before the two bodies were found, Giglio Mayor Sergio Ortelli said at least six ship workers and 11 passengers still had not been located. Authorities are reviewing passenger lists to confirm the exact number of missing people, said Giuseppe Orsina, a spokesman with the local civil protection agency. Many of those rescued in the early hours were taken to small churches and other buildings around the island for shelter. Some were still wearing the pajamas and slippers they had on, as the ship went down. \u201cThese people could be still on the island of Giglio, in private houses or in hospitals,\u201d Orsina said. The U.S. Embassy in Italy, on its Twitter feed, said two of the 120 Americans who were aboard the ship still had not been accounted for. It was not clear Sunday as to the nationalities of other missing people, with CNN affiliates having reported Italians, Peruvians, Brazilians, French and Britons were all represented on the ship. There were fears the death toll could rise as rescuers searched the ship, which was nearly 50% submerged and had a gash in its hull, authorities said.  As the search for survivors continued Monday, questions and criticism continued about what caused the shipwreck and the adequacy of the response. Speaking on Italian television, the ship\u2019s captain insisted the rocks that the Concordia hit were not marked on his map. \u201cOn the nautical chart, it was marked just as water,\u201d Schettino said, adding that the ship was about 300 meters from shore. But Nicastro, the Coast Guard spokesman, insisted that the waters where the ship ran aground were well-mapped. Local fishermen say the island coast of Giglio is known for its rocky sea floor.  \u201cEvery danger in this area is on the nautical chart,\u201d Nicastro said. \u201cThis is a place were a lot of people come for diving and sailing. \u2026 All the dangers are known.\u201d He said the Coast Guard was investigating why the ship took the course it did. \u201cWe know where the ship was,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know it was too close to the island. \u2026 We don\u2019t know why.\u201d Like a scene out of the film \u2018Titanic,\u2019 chaos consumed listing ship Italian prosecutors seized the ship\u2019s data recorders Saturday, and expect to analyze them within days. Costa Cruses said Sunday that it can only access that information with authorities\u2019 permission. Built in 2006, the Concordia had been on a Mediterranean cruise from Rome with stops in Savona, Marseille, Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca, Cagliari and Palermo. The ship was carrying about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members when it ran aground and began taking on water Friday night.  The crew kept going because they believed the vessel could continue sailing normally, said Nicastro, the Coast Guard spokesman. Realizing there was a significant safety problem, the commander steered the Costa Concordia closer toward the port of Giglio, he said. Authorities are looking at why the ship didn\u2019t send a mayday during the accident.  Besides the two elderly people, the dead include two French tourists and a crew member from Peru, port authorities in Livorno said. One of the victims was a 65-year-old woman who died of a heart attack, authorities said.  Rescuers overnight Saturday reached two South Korean passengers who had been trapped in the ship for more than 24 hours, authorities said. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle that we found the Korean couple alive, and we hope we\u2019ll find more people,\u201d said Nicastro of the Italian Coast Guard.  The couple, both 29, were found in a cabin after they heard rescuers calling out and managed to make contact, according to Italy\u2019s ANSA news agency. Video showed the couple, reportedly on their honeymoon, being taken ashore and loaded into a waiting ambulance. "

Substitute Gonzalo Higuain leveled the scores in the 71st minute before Callejon netted five minutes from the end to give Real an eight-point cushion over rivals Barcelona who play Real Betis at the Nou Camp on Sunday.  Third-placed Valencia missed the chance to move within one point of Barca as they slumped to a 1-0 home defeat to Real Sociedad.  French winger Antoine Griezmann\u2019s deflected shot in the 55 minute proving enough to earn Sociedad a vital win.

Mauricio Lanzaro gave them the lead with a well-executed header in the 39th minute, but 11 minutes from time Zaragoza defender Javier Paredes scored an own goal.  It denied the home side a valuable three points which would have put them in touch with fellow strugglers Sporting Gijon and Villarreal.   Meanwhile in Italy, Saturday\u2019s only fixture between Catania and Roma was abandoned 20 minutes into the second half due to a waterlogged pitch.  The kick-off had already been delayed due to a torrential downpour, but further rain during the game forced referee to Paolo Tagliavento to take the players off and eventually force a premature end to the match with the score a 1-1. Nicola Legrottaglie put the hosts ahead in the 24th minute but Roma responded with an equalizer three minutes later courtesy of a strike from Daniele De Rossi. "

Defiant Gordon wins 12th stage Compatriot Cyril Despres looks almost certain to win the motorcycle competition as he takes an 11-minute lead over nearest rival Marc Coma into Sunday\u2019s final stage in Lima after the Spaniard labored with gearbox problems.  Portugal\u2019s Helder Rodrigues, riding a Yamaha, won the penultimate stage of the motorcycle race finishing 47 seconds ahead of Despres. \u201cToday\u2019s stage was psychologically very tough,\u201d Despres said, AFP reported.  \u201cI always wait until the last day to enjoy things. I have seen so many things happen at the Dakar, and even more today. I want to stay calm and enjoy things a bit more,\u201d he added. "

Both players have yet to complete their third rounds due to delays caused by thunderstorms on the first and second days. Along with many other players including overnight leader England\u2019s Robert Rock, Grace and Finch have only a handful of holes to complete before they can start their final rounds on Sunday.  At close of play, which was again halted prematurely by heavy rain, Grace had completed 15 holes which included five birdies, while Finch was four-under par for his third round having completed one hole fewer. While completing his second round earlier in the day Finch recorded a hole-in-one at the par three 12th hole on the East Course at the Royal Johannesburg and Kensington Golf Club which helped him to a six-under par round of 66.   He and Grace are one shot ahead of South African George Coetzee who is three under par (and 14 under overall) after completing 14 holes of his third round. Two shots back on 12-under par and tied for fourth place are Canadian Andrew Parr and another South African Dawie van der Walt who have both completed their third rounds.  Parr had a particularly fine day shooting a faultless eight-under par round of 64, while van der Walt posted a very tidy 67.  Rock is a shot further adrift in a tie for seventh on 11-under par.    Reigning Masters champion Charl Schwartzel missed the cut by one shot, thus ending any hopes of him winning the tournament for the third year in succession.   Meanwhile in Hawaii at the Sony Open, Matt Every posted a second round six-under par 64 to lead Canada\u2019s David Hearn (66) and Sweden\u2019s Carl Pettersson (67) by two shots heading into the weekend.  Every, who finished his round in style with three consecutive birdies, is currently 10-under par.  Three players are tied for fourth on seven-under par including Americans Pat Perez and Doug LaBelle II, and Zimbabwe\u2019s Brendon de Jonge who carded a 62 \u2013 the lowest round of the day and the tournament so far.

        "content": "A criminal investigation has been launched in France into the death in Syria of a French journalist, television station France 2 said. France 2 TV journalist Gilles Jacquier was killed Wednesday after a mortar shell struck the pro-government rally he was attending as part of a government-authorized tour of the city of Homs, his network said. The involuntary homicide investigation in Paris follows a criminal complaint filed by the public prosecutor of Paris and the chief executive of France Televisions, the parent group of France 2. They want \u201cto shed light\u201d on the circumstances around Jaquier\u2019s death, the France 2 statement said.  Thierry Thuillier, managing editor of France Televisions, is quoted as saying there were \u201cdisturbing\u201d elements, particularly given the strict government controls under which the journalists were operating. \u201cFor example, why, when the convoy of journalists was escorted militarily, why all of a sudden the military disappear at the time of the first shots?\u201d he said. Thuillier said that \u201cfor now, the Syrian government answers are not satisfactory,\u201d according to the statement. Syria said Thursday it is setting up a commission of inquiry but Thuillier said it did not yet appear to exist. Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition activist group, reported that three civilians had died Saturday in Homs, among them a child aged 13, and another in Idlib, all of gunshot injuries. There has been widespread grassroots and international anger over the Syrian government\u2019s 10-month crackdown against peaceful protesters that has continued despite the presence of the Arab League observers. Opposition activists estimate the number of dead at more than 6,000. The Arab League has called on Damascus to stop violence against civilians, free political detainees, remove tanks and weapons from cities and allow outsiders, including members of the international news media, to travel freely around Syria. Its monitors are due to remain in Syria until January 19. The emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani, told CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in a recent interview that Arab troops should be deployed to Syria to stop the killings. Relatives accompanied Jacquier\u2019s body as it was flown to an airport near Paris Friday, to be greeted by Culture Minister Frederic Mitterand. An autopsy was due to be carried out Friday. His funeral will take place next week in the village where he is from, the France 2 statement said, and a ceremony to honor him will be held in Paris. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told France 2 on Thursday that Syria should have ensured the safety of the delegation of journalists it had invited to visit Homs. An \u201cinvestigation must establish the origin of these events, and in particular where the firing came from, who is responsible for this, so that we can then act accordingly,\u201d Juppe said. Speaking to France TV Info, another part of the France Televisions group, Thuillier said Jacquier and his cameraman had not wanted to go to Homs, as their story was about the political situation in Damascus, but had been given little choice by the Syrian authorities. The cameraman, Christopher Kenck, was injured by shrapnel just before the shell was fired that hit Jacquier, Thuillier said. Eight Syrians also died in the attack. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said Jacquier was among a delegation of international journalists visiting the city\u2019s Ekrima neighborhood \u201cto document the damages left by terrorists on building with photos and interviewing citizens who were victims of terror in the city when armed terrorist member fired mortar projectiles on the delegation.\u201d But the Syrian Revolution General Commission, an opposition force, disputed that description of events. It said security forces fired two shells at journalists from an infantry vehicle. The Syrian government says it is combating \u201carmed terrorists.\u201d"

        "content": "Rescuers reached two trapped honeymooners in the interior of a cruise ship more than 24 hours after it ran aground off a picturesque Italian island, killing three people,  injuring 20 and leaving dozens unaccounted for. The South Korean passengers, each 29, heard searchers calling out on the Costa Concordia, Italy\u2019s ANSA news agency reported early Sunday. They were located in a cabin and taken ashore. Video showed them being taken to a waiting ambulance. The captain of the ill-fated vessel, which turned over on its side after the grounding, was arrested late Saturday and was being investigated for abandoning ship and manslaughter, a local prosecutor said. With perhaps up to 50 people unaccounted for, divers suspended their efforts at dark, with plans to resume the search in the azure waters off the island of Giglio at dawn Sunday.  Accounts of the chaos from many of the 3,200 passengers were reminiscent of a maritime disaster 100 years ago this April \u2013 the loss of the RMS Titanic. \u201cFor me, the worst part of the whole ordeal\u201d was when a lifeboat crew member told those boarding that it was \u201cwomen and children first,\u201d said passenger Benji Smith of Boston. \u201cAll these families who were clinging to each other had to be separated,\u201d Smith told CNN. Some passengers fell into the chilly waters during the rescue, ANSA reported. Questions abounded: Why was the colossal ship so close to the shore? How fast was it moving? How well did the crew respond? According to many passengers, the evacuation was disorganized and no one seemed in charge. \u201cEvery crew member who walked past shouted instructions, but the instructions contradicted each other,\u201d Smith said. Concordia\u2019s captain, Francesco Schettino, was interviewed earlier Saturday about what happened when the ship struck rocks in shallow water off Italy\u2019s western coast Friday evening, said officer Emilio Del Santo of the Coastal Authorities of Livorno. Local fishermen say the island coast of Giglio is known for its rocky sea floor.  Schettino said \u201cthat rock was not indicated on the chart,\u201d according to ANSA. \u201cMe and the crew, we were the last to abandon ship,\u201d he said. The ship was 2.5 miles off route when it struck the rocky sandbar.  \u201cThere are rocks, they are on the maps,\u201d said Capt. Cosimo Nicastro of the Italian Coast Guard. \u201cWhat we know is the ship went really close to these rocks. \u2026 We don\u2019t yet know why.\u201d The ship began taking on water Friday evening and the crew kept going because they believed the vessel could normally keep sailing, Nicastro said. Realizing there was a significant safety problem, the commander steered the Costa Concordia closer toward port. Authorities also were looking at why the ship didn\u2019t hail a mayday during the accident.  \u201cAt the moment we can\u2019t exclude that the ship had some kind of technical problem, and for this reason moved towards the coast in order to save the passengers, the crew and the ship. But they didn\u2019t send a mayday. The ship got in contact with us once the evacuation procedures were already ongoing,\u201d Del Santo said prior to the announcement of the captain\u2019s arrest. Giuseppe Orsina, a spokesman with the local civil protection agency, said 43 to 51 people were missing, though authorities are reviewing passenger lists to confirm the exact figure. \u201cThese people could be still on the island of Giglio, in private houses or in hospitals,\u201d Orsina said. Two French tourists and a crew member from Peru were killed, Port authorities in Livorno said. One of the victims was a 65-year-old woman who died of a heart attack, according to authorities.  Nautilus International, a maritime employees trade union, called the accident a \u201cwake-up call\u201d to regulators. \u201cNautilus is concerned about the rapid recent increases in the size of passenger ships \u2013 with the average tonnage doubling over the past decade,\u201d said Nautilus general secretary Mark Dickinson in a statement. \u201cMany ships are now effectively small towns at sea, and the sheer number of people onboard raises serious questions about evacuation.\u201d Gianni Onorato, president of Genoa-based Costa Cruises, expressed \u201cdeep sorrow for this terrible tragedy,\u201d but said the cruise line was unable to answer all the questions that authorities are now investigating. The vessel, plying the waters from Civitavecchia to Savona, Italy, struck a submerged rock, Onorato said in a statement before the announcement of the captain\u2019s arrest. \u201cCaptain Schettino, who was on the bridge at the time, immediately understood the severity of the situation and performed a maneuver intended to protect both guests and crew, and initiated security procedures to prepare for an eventual ship evacuation,\u201d he continued. \u201cUnfortunately, that operation was complicated by a sudden tilting of the ship that made disembarkation difficult,\u201d Onorato said.  Rosalyn Rincon, a member of the cruise ship staff, said the captain told passengers there was an \u201celectrical problem.\u201d Concordia was carrying about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members when it ran aground. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that it (the ship) would wind up tipping like this,\u201d said Neil Gallagher, professor of naval architecture at the Webb Institute on Long Island, New York. \u201cSomething had to go wrong with either the controls or the navigation to get it to this condition.\u201d Chris B. McKesson, adjunct professor of naval architecture at the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering at the University of New Orleans, said, \u201cfrom the size of the gash, she must have been steaming at a pretty good pace.\u201d Fear and panic aboard crippled ship Panic spread as people scrambled to find lifeboats in the dark as the ship quickly leaned to one side late Friday. Access to some lifeboats was hampered by the ship\u2019s tilt into the water. With the ship\u2019s staircases flooded, Smith and others made rope ladders to climb from the outer fourth deck to the third. They were eventually rescued more than three hours later by a lifeboat that had returned from dropping passengers ashore. At least three lifeboats, each with a capacity of more than 100 people, apparently malfunctioned due to technical or crew error, Smith said. \u201cThe people manning these boats were just cooks and shopkeepers,\u201d Smith said.  Cmdr. Buddy Reams, chief of the U.S. Coast Guard\u2019s Cruise Ship National Center of Expertise, said, \u201cwhen it comes to cruise ships, in the event of emergency, cabin stewards or others would have safety roles,\u201d he said. The Coast Guard inspects foreign-flagged cruise ships in U.S. waters twice a year, studying the competency of the crew during fire and abandon-ship drills, Reams said. Many passengers asked why they had not yet received an obligatory safety briefing when disaster struck around dinner time, only hours into their journey. The timing of the safety briefings and muster drills depend on the length of the cruise, Reams told CNN. Many of those rescued in the early hours were taken to small churches and other buildings around the island for shelter. Some were still wearing the pajamas and slippers they had on as the ship went down. Vivian Shafer, a passenger from Maryland, told CNN there was no initial announcement after the vessel began its tilt. Others reported being unable to clearly hear instructions. Once ashore, no one from the crew assisted them, Shafer said. Rather, it was up to islanders. \u201cThere didn\u2019t seem to be anybody in charge,\u201d she said. Costa Cruises, owned by parent company Carnival Corp., said it was focusing on the final stages of the emergency operation and helping passengers and crew return home. \u201cIt is a tragedy that deeply affects our company. Our first thoughts go to the victims and we would like to express our condolences and our closeness to their families and friends,\u201d the line said on its website. The Concordia, built in 2006, was on a Mediterranean cruise from Rome with stops in Savona, Marseille, Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca, Cagliari and Palermo. Most of the passengers on board were Italian. CNN affiliate America Noticias, in Peru, said a group of 32 Peruvians were also onboard. Brazil\u2019s state-run Agencia Brasil said 53 Brazilians were on the cruise ship. An estimated 126 Americans were also on board, according to the U.S. State Department. There were no reports of injured Americans though the U.S. Embassy in Rome said it was unable to account for all U.S. citizens believed to be on board the ship at the time of the accident. Another Costa ship was involved in a deadly 2010 accident when the Costa Europa crashed into a pier in Egypt\u2019s Sharm el-Sheikh during stormy weather, killing three crew members. "

The Costa Concordia, owned by Genoa-based Costa Cruises, ran aground on a sand bank just off the island, located off of Italy\u2019s western coast, ANSA reported. The incident occurred during dinnertime, witness Luciano Castro told ANSA. The ship was carrying around 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members at the time, according to the cruise line\u2019s blog.

        "content": "Turkish security forces launched a wave of raids across the country on Friday, searching more than 100 locations and arresting dozens of people. The raids were carried out in connection with a sprawling investigation into the urban wing of the banned Kurdish separatist movement the Kurdistan Workers Party, according to the semi-official Anatolian Agency. Anatolian also reported that Turkish police pursued information from a detained Kurdistan Workers Party member about 5 kilograms of C-4 plastic explosives that had been buried near Ataturk Olympic Stadium on the European side of Istanbul. Fighters from the Kurdistan Workers Party have been waging a guerrilla war against the Turkish state since the early 1980s. More than 30,000 people, most of them ethnic Kurds, have been killed in the conflict. The Kurds are Turkey\u2019s largest ethnic minority, and for decades, they have been targeted by discriminatory state policies that banned Kurdish language and education. A top official from Turkey\u2019s main Kurdish political party, the Peace and Democracy Party, said that many of the locations searched were local party offices, as well as the offices of the Turkish Human Rights Association.   Peace and Democracy Party deputy co-chairwoman Meral Danis Bestas denounced the police search of the home of Leyla Zana, a party lawmaker who spent a decade in prison for speaking in Kurdish while taking an oath in the Turkish parliament. \u201cThese searches are entirely against the law,\u201d Bestas said. Bestas said that at least two prominent Kurdish politicians, a former parliament member and a former chairman of a Kurdish political party were also arrested in the police raids. Last month, Turkish police launched a similar wave of raids that resulted in the detention of at least 38 journalists and media workers who were accused of working with the \u201cpropaganda department\u201d of the Kurdistan Workers party\u2019s urban wing."

Then, at about dinnertime, the lights went out, an ominous scraping sound moaned through the hull, and the ship tilted to one side. The 1,500-cabin luxury vessel, which was also carrying about 1,000 crew members, had run aground on a rocky sandbar off the tiny island of Giglio. Chaos overwhelmed passengers and crew alike when, as the ship listed and water rose as if it were a scene from \u201cTitanic,\u201d everyone realized that only one side of the ship\u2019s lifeboats and rafts were reachable. Amid screams, the crew appeared helpless, according to one passenger who had to make a ladder of rope to save himself and his wife. \u201cIt was the Marx brothers watching these guys trying to figure out how to work the boat,\u201d said Benji Smith, who was on the Concordia for his honeymoon with his wife, Emily. The couple live in Boston. \u201cI felt like the disaster itself was manageable,\u201d Smith added, referring to the grounding and tilting of the ship, \u201cbut I felt like the crew was going to kill us.\u201d The worst part came when a lifeboat crew member told everyone, \u201cWomen and children first,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAll these families who were clinging to each other had to be separated,\u201d he added. After helping passengers, some crew members jumped overboard and swam ashore. Search continues for missing passengers At least three lifeboats apparently malfunctioned due to technical or crew error, Smith said. Life rafts were \u201ctwisting and turning,\u201d and the crew pulled in some rafts and put the people back on the ship, but the crew never returned for them, Smith said. With the ship\u2019s staircases flooded, \u201cwe made ladders out of ropes to climb down from the outer fourth deck to the third deck,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe waited clinging to those rope ladders for 3\u00bd hours\u201d before being picked up by a lifeboat that returned from dropping passengers onshore, he said. Smith said he and his wife never heard from any of the officers or captain during the incident. The couple was eventually transported by bus to a hotel in Rome. \u201cI\u2019ve been awake for 40 hours \u2013 I still have never spoken to a person from Costa,\u201d he said, adding that no food, clothes, or money were provided by the cruise line.  Many passengers complained about how the cruise ship staff handled the crisis and asked why they had not yet received an obligatory safety briefing when disaster struck, only hours into their journey. \u201cWe attended a safety presentation on the first day,\u201d but he says it didn\u2019t turn out to have any safety information, he said. \u201cIt was only a sales pitch\u201d for shore excursions, Smith said.  Mark Plath of Little Rock, Arkansas, said 200 passengers swam about 100 yards to rocks, where they awaited further assistance. \u201cWe were helping the staff more than they were helping us,\u201d Plath said of the ordeal. Rosalyn Rincon, a member of the cruise ship staff who worked as a dancer, was in the middle of a magician\u2019s act when the ship ran aground. She was inside a box during a magic show when, she said, \u201cI realized that everything stopped. The music stopped,\u201d she said. Everything on the stage fell on top of people because the ship listed dramatically, said Rincon, 30, of Blackpool, England. \u201cThere was no signal as to what was going on until about 30 minutes into it,\u201d Rincon told CNN. Her boyfriend, an Italian engineer officer on the vessel, told her that there was a blackout and the ship crashed into something. \u201cThey told us there was a fire,\u201d she said. Then another blackout occurred, and the ship went into darkness, she said. She put on her life vest in her cabin, she said. About 15 minutes later, \u201cthe captain of the ship told us it was an electrical problem,\u201d Rincon said. Rincon thought to herself: \u201cIf it was an electrical problem, why were we tilting,\u201d she said. Several minutes later, \u201cwe were told to abandon ship,\u201d Rincon said. Then panic set in, she said. \u201cThis is the problem: You\u2019ve got 3,000 passengers, you\u2019ve got 2,000 crew members, and you got only one side of usage of lifeboats and life rafts\u201d because the ship was resting on one side, Rincon said in a telephone interview from her Italian hotel. Rincon realized there was going to be a shortage of lifesaving watercraft, she said. \u201cYou were going higher and higher, and you were on a vertical position. I was holding on to the railing. All you could see was noise and creaks. It was very, very scary,\u201d Rincon said. Rincon was able to get into a rescue boat \u2013 after all the passengers were put on lifeboats or life rafts, she said. \u201cWe were literally thrown into the boat,\u201d Rincon said. Several crew members jumped overboard and swam to the mountain shore, she said. One friend was rescued by helicopter from the top of the ship, Rincon said. Passenger Laurie Willits from Ontario, Canada, who was watching the magic show with her husband, told CNN: \u201cAll of a sudden the lights flashed, and the boat tipped like it was turning, but it didn\u2019t return to level.\u201d  Emergency announcements in English and other languages were difficult to hear, Willits said.  Panic spread as people scrambled to find lifeboats in the dark as the ship quickly leaned to one side.  Lifeboats on the higher side got stuck, Willits said, leaving some people suspended in mid-air for a long time. The sounds of children crying and screaming could be heard. Willits and her husband managed to get into a lifeboat about an hour to 90 minutes after the alarm was raised, and were among the first to be taken to land. American Nancy Lofaro said she and her husband Mario were watching the magic show, when there was a \u201cgrinding noise.\u201d All the performers ran off the stage, she said, leaving the audience in the theater. She added that 30 minutes passed before there was any announcement, saying everything was under control. \u201cThe crew tried hard but they kept telling us they had no information, and it wasn\u2019t until an hour into this situation that we got into a lifeboat and were lowered.\u201d Lofaro described a chaotic situation on the lifeboat. \u201cAt one point we were being lowered, and we were sliding off to one side. Everyone fell into one side of the boat and were slamming into the ship. This happened a few times over 30 seconds. And finally we were lowered into the water level. It took 30 minutes to get to shore\u2026 the lifeboats were slamming into each other. It was chaos.\u201d At reception centers set up on shore Saturday, some passengers were still wearing pajamas, slippers or housecoats from when the alarm was first raised on the ship. Most were without their money, phones and valuables. Sirens blared as some of the injured were taken to hospital. Helicopters lifted some people from the badly listing ship. Rescue officials said their operation peaked between midnight and 3 a.m. Saturday, and calm seas prevented greater loss of life. Three people were confirmed dead and 20 injured. Many people spent the night in small churches and other buildings around the island before being ferried to the mainland to make their way home. The Italian cruise company, Costa Cruises, said it would help passengers return home. Costa is owned by parent company Carnival Corp. An investigation into the cause of the disaster is under way, officials said."

        "content": "England\u2019s Robert Rock led the Joburg Open when thunderstorms brought play to an early end Friday while two-time defending champion Charl Schwartzel faced an anxious wait to see if he will make the halfway cut. Rock carded a four-under-par 67 on Royal Johannesburg and Kensington\u2019s West Course to add to his opening 65 over the East layout for an 11-under-par 132 halfway total. Reigning U.S. Masters champion Schwartzel improved on his first day level-par 72 to shoot a three-under 68 on the East, but is right on the projected cut-line with half the field still to complete their second rounds. The World No.9 admitted he had been below his best, particularly on the greens. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy when things are going your way, but on days like this it becomes a mental battle,\u201d he told gathered reporters after his round. \u201cI felt I hung in well, I didn\u2019t get down on myself. It would have been easy to lose my temper, but so early in the year, there\u2019s no point. The only way through it is to play, and hopefully I can get into the weekend,\u201d he added. Rock has a one-shot lead over South Africans Jbe Kruger and Branden Grace after both carded second rounds of 66 on the West Course. Another South African, Michiel Bothma, is in the clubhouse on nine-under, but his compatriot  George Coetzee will threaten Rock\u2019s lead when he resumes on the East course Saturday morning on the same mark with 12 holes to play. First round leader Jamie Elson of England, who carded an eight-under 63 on the East Course, did not get the chance to start his second round before the storms came in. Two-time U.S. Open champion Retief Goosen is also well-placed on seven-under having completed just six holes of his second round. Meanwhile on the PGA Tour, Canada\u2019s Graham DeLaet took the first-round lead in the $5.5  million Sony Open in Hawaii. DeLaet carded an eagle-birdie-birdie finish for a seven-under 63 at the the Waialae Country Club. He had a two-stroke lead over South Korean K.J. Choi, Sweden\u2019s Carl  Pettersson and Kyle Reifers, who shot 65s. \u201cI\u2019m just so excited to be back out,\u201d DeLaet, who is returning after being sidelined for nearly a year with back surgery, told AFP. Steve Stricker, winner of the season-opening Tournament of Champions, shot a 66 to share fifth place. The American is trying to become the first player since South African Ernie Els in 2003 to win the Tournament of Champions and Sony Open.      "

The former world No. 1s, who have clashed in eight title deciders, could meet in the semifinals of the tennis season\u2019s opening major, which begins in Melbourne on Monday. Federer, seeking to extend his record of 16 grand slam titles, will start against a qualifier, as will Nadal \u2013 bidding for his 11th elite crown. Defending champion Djokovic, however, will start out against Italy\u2019s 108th-ranked Paolo Lorenzi as he starts a campaign that could see him meet last year\u2019s runner-up Andy Murray in the last four.  Fourth seed Murray, who lost to Federer in the 2010 final, begins against American 19-year-old Ryan Harrison, ranked 84th. In the women\u2019s draw, world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki is top seed for the sixth grand slam in a row. The Dane, who is yet to win one of the four grand slams, starts off against Australia\u2019s Anastasia Rodionova. Second seed Petra Kvitova, who could move to the top of the world rankings in Melbourne, has been drawn to face world No. 84 Vera Dushevina of Russia. Sixth seed Samantha Stosur, who became Australia\u2019s first winner of a women\u2019s grand slam singles title in 31 years at the 2011 U.S. Open, will play Romania\u2019s 60th-ranked Sorana Cirstea.

The Belarusian claimed her sixth WTA Tour title after a high-quality clash to boost her hopes of a first grand slam title in Melbourne, where she will play Britain\u2019s Heather Watson in the first round. \u201cIt was really difficult. I knew at some point I would get a chance, so I just had to stay with her and fight. I kept my composure,\u201d Azarenka told the WTA Tour website.  \u201cWe showed some incredible tennis out there.

        "content": "The Duchess of York faces charges in Turkey for going undercover and secretly filming children at a state-run home for a documentary, according to the semiofficial Anatolian news agency. The Ankara Prosecutor\u2019s office accused the Duchess of York of violating the private lives and rights of five children while filming the program for Britain\u2019s ITV network, Anatolian reported Thursday. A hidden camera was used during Sarah Ferguson\u2019s visit to the Children\u2019s Nurturing and Rehabilitation Center outside Ankara. She wore a disguise of a dark wig and headscarf for the filming. Opening the case, the Ankara chief prosecutor asked for a prison term of up to 22 years, six months, Turkish state TV reported. There are no details on when a trial might take place, if at all. A UK Home Office spokesman said: \u201cIt is not our usual policy to comment on individual cases.  \u201cHowever, the Home Office can confirm it has received a formal request for mutual legal assistance concerning Sarah, Duchess of York. It is not appropriate to comment further.\u201d  The Duchess of York said in a statement: \u201cI stand strong in the face of the rights of children, and I remain steadfast. Children are our future.\u201d ITV News spokesman Grant Cunningham said Friday: \u201cITV was made aware yesterday through media reports of charges related to our program being raised again. \u201cCharges were raised in 2008 and we said at that time that we firmly stand by our program and our position remains unchanged.\u201d The Duchess was accompanied by one of her two daughters, Princess Eugenie, to film the ITV Tonight program in Turkey. An ITV press statement at the time of the film\u2019s broadcast in 2008 said the duchess, as part of a reporting team, had gone \u201cundercover in one of Turkey\u2019s worst institutions \u2013 capturing images that will shock and horrify.\u201d The \u201chard-hitting\u201d program was intended to \u201chelp investigate the treatment of mentally and physically disabled children,\u201d ITV said. The duchess and her other daughter, Beatrice, traveled to Romania to see how state orphanages run for the second half of the program.

        "content": "It\u2019s a breathtaking scenario. Hundreds of petrol-heads roaring across some of South America\u2019s most stunning landscapes in a grueling two-week endurance race where the competitors are at the mercy of treacherous terrain. The Dakar Rally\u2019s 465 competitors speed through the daunting sand dunes of Atacama desert one day, and traverse the snow-capped Andes mountain range the next in a 9,000-kilometer coast-to-coast marathon taking in Argentina, Chile and, this year, Peru. But environmentalists are worried about the effect the event \u2013 which attracts millions of spectators \u2013 has on a continent that is home to a wealth of fragile ecosystems. Argentine ecological group FUNAM has accused officials of failing to conduct the necessary environmental impact assessments before ratifying the route of the race, which ends on Sunday. \u201cThe first issue to be analyzed is regulation,\u201d FUNAM president Dr. Raul Montenegro told CNN. \u201cIn Argentina, for the last rally, a lot of regulations were not accomplished by the race organizers and even local government. \u201cThe environmental impact assessment is mandatory, and these kind of things were never presented and accomplished.\u201d However, race director Etienne Lavigne insists the Dakar is only staged in areas where it has permission to go. \u201cWhere we are going to go with the Dakar, we are authorized to go,\u201d Lavigne told CNN. \u201cThat means we work all the year with all the administration in each country to get permission to go where it\u2019s possible to go. \u201cThe Dakar is like a cocktail. Which means you need to put in a lot of ingredients. Every year we chose the best places for the best sport in the event. \u201cThis year, with three countries, we have a fantastic route with a lot of different landscapes, very different every day. A level of difficulty is very important every day. With the three countries, we are really in the best position to have the best route for the 2012 edition.\u201d But Montenegro counters that this desire to find the most dramatic and challenging landscapes is taking the rally into terrains which are not ready for the barrage of vehicles \u2013 which come in four categories: cars, motorbikes, quadbikes and trucks.. \u201cMost of the adventure of the Dakar is to use natural landscapes and scenery,\u201d Montenegro said. \u201cOur region, Argentina, Chile and now Peru, are really not prepared for this kind of event, especially environments which have very fragile ecosystems.\u201d The Dakar, first staged in 1979, is named after the Senegalese capital which once served as its finishing point.  Competitors would set off from the French capital of Paris, in the shadow of the iconic Eiffel Tower, and make tracks through north Africa to Senegal and, for the victorious few, racing immortality. A test of courage, stamina, strength and skill, the Dakar relocated to South America in 2009 after the murder of a French family in Mauritania, combined with terrorist threats made against the race, forced the cancellation of the previous year\u2019s event. The continental switch has forced competitors to adapt to new sets of laws and regulations in South America, a transition that has thrown up several problems, according to Montenegro. He and his team took many photos during last year\u2019s installment that claim to show drivers breaking traffic laws on local roads when traveling between stages of the race. \u201cDuring the 2011 rally, it was clear the people taking part in the competition in Argentina violated (traffic laws). Not during the competition itself, but during connections between stages,\u201d he said. \u201cWe took more than 180 pictures showing these infractions. They put families in danger because at the time it was the holiday season in Cordoba.\u201d Lavigne insists the Dakar is committed to doing all it can to ensure race entrants obey local laws during the rally. \u201cWe work with all the authorities, the police,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to respect the law. We are increasing the level of control with the full support of all the police authorities in the three countries.\u201d Organizers have sent the images captured by Montenegro and his colleagues to the 2012 entrants as examples of how not to drive on local roads. Despite the controversy surrounding the Dakar, it would seem the rally is a hit with local fans. The event\u2019s official website claimed that last year five million spectators across two countries turned out \u2013 3.5 million in Argentina and 1.5 million in Chile. And Lavigne revealed that three more nations want to follow Peru and join the race.  \u201cWe can imagine including a new country in the next route in 2013. At the moment it\u2019s a bit early to speak about it, but we are working on some projects including a new country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have good potential there (in South America) with a lot of propositions from other countries like Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia.\u201d The race\u2019s official website claims that \u201centering the Dakar is, in a certain way, like climbing Everest, sailing round the globe or rowing round the world.\u201d Regardless of the political and environmental issues surrounding the rally, the racers who are crowned winners in Buenos Aires on Sunday will have achieved an unforgettable feat."

        "content": "In colloquial Turkish, the word zenne means male belly dancer. It is also the title of a new film that explores sexual identity while also highlighting a deadly case of homophobia in modern-day Turkey. \u201cThe starting point was a dear friend of ours who was murdered in 2008 for being gay by his own father,\u201d said Mehmet Binay, producer and co-director of \u201cZenne,\u201d which opens in theaters across Turkey on Friday. Binay was referring to the 2008 killing of Ahmet Yildiz, a 26-year old physics student who was gunned down in Istanbul. Court records identify Yildiz\u2019s father, Yahya, as the primary suspect in the killing. The father\u2019s motive, according to a copy of the indictment, was that he \u201cdid not accept the victim to be in a gay relationship.\u201d More than three years after the slaying, Yildiz\u2019s father is a fugitive, still wanted by Turkish police.  The death has since been widely referred to as Turkey\u2019s first gay honor killing. One of the main characters in \u201cZenne\u201d is based on Ahmet Yildiz and his tragic story. Caner Alper, the writer and other co-director of \u201cZenne,\u201d was also a friend of Yildiz\u2019s. Alper said before he died, Yildiz often spoke about receiving death threats from his family, who were trying to \u201ccure\u201d him of his homosexuality. Court documents show Yildiz reported these death threats to the Turkish authorities. In an interview with CNN this week, the filmmakers said they hoped their film would force Turkish society to debate hate crimes that target victims based on gender, religion, ethnicity or sexual identity. \u201cDeath and murder is still on the agenda of our country. We can\u2019t get rid of this mentality,\u201d said Binay. \u201cPeople need to tolerate each other. They need to understand that different identities can live next to each other without disturbing each other.\u201d Binay and Alper are not only creative partners. Shortly before the debut of their debut film at the Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival, Turkey\u2019s most prestigious film festival, the two men announced they had been a couple for 14 years. Alper said their families advised against coming out publicly. \u201cThey thought it would be career suicide,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil we won five awards from the first festival that we attended.\u201d Despite recent critical acclaim, the filmmakers agreed Turkey still has a long way to go before it overcomes deeply entrenched institutional homophobia. According to Article 17 of the health regulations of the Turkish Armed Forces, homosexuality is considered a \u201cpsychosexual deviance.\u201d All Turkish men are required to perform military service. But gay men can be exempted from conscript duty provided they first prove their homosexuality. \u201cZenne\u201d depicts the degrading process its main characters endure at an army recruiting center. In the film, military doctors perform anal examinations and hurl homophobic insults at conscripts. They also demand photos of the characters having sex with other men. Gay rights activists say the military has long demanded graphic photo and/or video evidence from men asking to be released from military duty. \u201cIn the photograph and the video you have to show your form and your face. Your face has to be clearly identified and another man has to be penetrating,\u201d said Kursad Kahramanoglu, who teaches international law and human sexuality at Istanbul\u2019s Bilgi University. CNN asked Turkey\u2019s defense ministry to comment on what gay rights groups claim has long been an unwritten military policy. \u201cThe practice of asking for video and photographic evidence is out of question,\u201d a defense ministry spokesman responded, speaking on condition of anonymity, a common practice in Turkish government bureaucracy. \u201cI cannot confirm that it definitely did not happen, but we do not have any information that such a thing happened,\u201d he added. The spokesman said the current policy is for conscripts to prove their homosexuality with a doctor\u2019s report from a private or military hospital. \u201cThe evaluation is made based on the medical report,\u201d he said. Less than two years ago, a senior Turkish government minister was quoted in an interview calling homosexuality \u201can illness \u2026 that should be treated.\u201d These types of statements have not stopped members of Turkey\u2019s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community from demanding equal rights. Thousands marched in a rainbow-hued gay pride parade through downtown Istanbul last July.  Some of the activists carried large posters of Ahmet Yildiz with the slogan \u201cget the murderer.\u201d Among those marching was Yildiz\u2019s former boyfriend, Ibrahim Can. \u201cI am fighting for the rights of my lover and for all the gays and lesbians and transsexuals in the world and in Turkey. And I want the Turkish government to change the homophobic attitude in Turkey,\u201d Can said in an interview with CNN. LGBT activists are lobbying the Turkish government to have the constitution amended to protect the rights of Turks on the grounds of gender and sexual identity. The Turkish Constitution is currently in the lengthy process of being re-written. Binay, meanwhile, points to what he calls remarkable progress for minority rights in Turkey over the last decade. He said: \u201cAll sorts of minorities including gays and lesbians are demanding their rights. They want recognition, they want protection by the state. They want to be able to live, first of all, and not be murdered.\u201d"

Pep Guardiola\u2019s side held a 4-0 lead from the first leg at the Nou Camp, but fell behind to Dejan Lekic\u2019s goal five minutes before halftime on a foggy night in Pamplona.

        "content": "Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso has slammed Formula One\u2019s rules on car testing, describing the regulations as like asking footballers to train with tennis balls or tennis stars to play with bats. The two-time world champion questioned the wisdom of the current rules, which allows one three-day in-season test in addition to a number of officially sanctioned pre-season tests. The Spaniard, who won the drivers\u2019 championship in 2005 and 2006, said there was only so much a team could learn from using computer simulators, explaining that some drivers look elsewhere in a bid for much-needed practice. \u201cHow much a new technical component can deliver in terms of performance remains a question mark after being tried out only on the simulator,\u201d the 30-year-old told a press conference at Ferrari\u2019s annual Wroom media event. \u201cF1 is one of the very few sports in which training is forbidden \u2026 It\u2019s like telling Lionel Messi to train with a little tennis ball or Rafael Nadal to play with a ping-pong bat\u2026We go karting because we have no alternative.\u201d The restrictions on testing mean some drivers turn to other motorsport disciplines, with Poland\u2019s Robert Kubica suffering compound fractures to his right elbow, shoulder and leg in a rallying accident last February. Kubica missed the whole of the 2011 season due to the crash and suffered a further setback on Wednesday when it was announced that he had broken his right leg during a fall at his home in Italy. The 27-year-old had already ruled out a comeback in time for the start of the 2012 world championship, with his former team Renault, now known as Lotus, recruiting an all-new driver line-up of 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen and Frenchman Romain Grosjean. But the recently renamed marque\u2019s principal, Eric Boullier, took the time to praise Kubica\u2019s courage and wish him a speedy recovery. \u201cRobert has shown fantastic courage and determination in his rehabilitation following the accident last year,\u201d Boullier told the team\u2019s official website.  \u201cIt is sad to hear that he has suffered this setback. On behalf of everyone at Lotus Renault GP, I would like to wish Robert a quick recovery.\u201d Before news of Kubica\u2019s latest injury emerged, Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali had been discussing the possibility of the former Sauber driver joining the Italian outfit as a replacement for Brazilian Felipe Massa. The future of Massa, who joined Ferrari in 2006, has been the subject of widespread speculation after a disappointing 2011 season saw him finish sixth in the drivers\u2019 standings. Domenicali described Kubica as a great driver, but stopped short of confirming or denying Ferrari\u2019s interest in him. \u201cRobert is a great driver, but he had very severe injuries and he is still working hard just to get back to normal living,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to wait and see. That kind of injury takes a long time to recover from.\u201d The 2012 F1 season will begin on March 18 with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. Meanwhile, Thursday\u2019s 11th stage of the Dakar Rally saw both overall leaders consolidate their advantages with victories in the 478km leg from Arica in Chile to Arequipa in Peru. Frenchman Stephane Peterhansel finished three minutes 44 seconds ahead of Nani Roma of Spain in the car section and now leads his fellow-Mini driver by 22 minutes and 49 seconds. American Robby Gordon\u2019s challenge finally ended, as more problems with his Hummer meant he limped home nearly two hours behind to slip to fourth place overall and completely out of contention barring a miracle. Another Frenchman, Cyril Despres, extended his lead to 2:22 over fellow-KTM rider and defending champion Marc Coma in the motorcycle section, after his fourth stage victory. Despres came home 1:39 ahead of Gerard Farres Guell, with Coma back in third place, although the gap is still comparatively small with three stages still remaining."

        "content": "To understand the full beauty of the ancient Mediterranean city of Rome you have to come to wintry, cold Germany.  In the east German city of Dresden, artist Yadegar Asisi has designed a panoramic scene of epic proportions, breathing life into a long-forgotten view of the Italian capital.  Using a detailed and much-praised painting by Alexander von Wagner and Josef B\u00fchlmann from 1886 as his inspiration, Asisi painted a first draft of Rome\u2019s cityscape in 1994.  Nearly 17 years later, an even more impressive version has gone on display; it will remain in Dresden only until September \u2013 a deliberate decision by the artist. \u201cTo me art is a constant process. I always want to improve my panoramic scenes,\u201d Asisi told CNN.  His 360 degree view of Rome in 312 AD is 27 meters high, 107 meters long and weighs 750 kilograms \u2013 making it one of the world\u2019s largest panoramic scenes.  Visitors overlook the city from a 15 meter high metallic tower located in the center of the perfectly circular museum: Standing on top of the tower, viewers feel they are part of Rome \u2013 though sadly unable to wander down the stairs and walk to the Colosseum.  Asisi chose as his subject a historical moment, the influence of which is still felt in Europe and around the world today: The triumphal procession of the Emperor Constantine the Great on October 29, 312.  Constantine\u2019s brutal success over his rivals marked the beginning of the Christian West. At that time Rome was vital to Europe, and the days when many of its magnificent buildings would lie in ruins were a long way off.  \u201cMoments that have shaped our world have a huge impact on my art\u201d, said Asisi, sitting in his large Berlin studio, its walls filled with his paintings and photographs of ancient buildings or old reliefs.  \u201cBut this panoramic scene is not really about showing a cityscape, it is more about the stories hidden within the city,\u201d Asisi said.  The panorama is a museum that needs no words to tell its stories. An art form dating back to 19th century Europe, panoramas fell out of fashion with the coming of the cinema. But why are people so fascinated?  \u201cIt seems Asisi\u2019s artistically and archaeologically-underpinned reconstruction of an ancient cityscape fills a large audience with enthusiasm for panoramic scenes and classical antiquity even today,\u201d said Andreas Scholl, director of Berlin\u2019s antiquities collection.  Asisi has created a second historic panorama showing the ancient Greek city of Pergamon (today located in Turkey), which is currently on show at Scholl\u2019s Pergamonmuseum, on the Museum Island in Berlin.  Asisi has been working on super-sized 360 degree panoramas since 1994. It takes him at least a year to design a single work, with previous subjects including Mount Everest and rainforests. \u201cOver the years the way panoramas were made has changed dramatically. I love to design on the computer as well as painting in the traditional way\u201d, Asisi said.  Today music samples, lighting and special effects are used to increase the impact of the panoramas, which change throughout the day, allowing visitors to see them by daylight or night.  Asisi has formed a symbiotic relationship between science and art: To him research is as important as artistic know-how.  \u201cI don\u2019t know whether my work is art or science. Probably it is both: Art starts where science stops,\u201d he said.  His passion for details has taken him to Rome countless times \u2013 and visitors\u2019 reactions suggest all that study has been worth the effort.  \u201cThis panorama is fascinating,\u201d said Rene Gust, 32, from Berlin. \u201cI have read about the beautiful Roman buildings lots of times before. But only now I understand why.\u201d \u201cIt is amazing to see how they go out of the museum,\u201d Asisi said. \u201cLots of them are touched by the painting.  \u201cI hope that the emotional connection between the panorama and the visitor will change their relationship with their environment.\u201d  Having grown up in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) some of his art focuses on social issues. He is planning a panorama of the Berlin Wall, but says that rather than examining the cruelties of the GDR regime, it will instead focus on a normal day in the once-split Berlin.  \u201cTo me it is extremely interesting why so many people in the former GDR did accept to live in such a country,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people - including me.\u201d Meanwhile his panoramas are exciting more and more interest overseas.  In 2003, Asisi drew a panorama for Daniel Libeskind which showed the architect\u2019s plans for the Ground Zero site in New York. Libeskind won the tendering process, and his design is currently under construction.  It was Asisi\u2019s first panorama to not only fake reality - but create it.  \u201cAnd there is much more to come,\u201d Asisi said."

        "content": "The man accused of killing 77 people in Norway last summer will undergo a new psychiatric evaluation, justice officials said Friday, after an earlier test found him to be insane. Judge Wenche Elizabeth Arntzen told reporters Friday that the court wanted a second opinion because of the importance of the question of his sanity to Anders Behring Breivik\u2019s trial, due to start in April. This was not a criticism of the previous report, she said.  Breivik has been assigned two new psychiatrists to carry out the evaluation, court spokesman Geir Engebretsen told CNN. The decision follows requests from the families of some of the victims, amid wide public debate in Norway over the initial psychiatric report, he said. In November, prosecutors said psychiatrists had determined Breivik was psychotic at the time of the attacks and during 13 interviews experts conducted with him afterward. The ruling meant he cannot be sentenced to prison or preventive detention, but he can be confined to a mental hospital for the rest of his life, prosecutors said. The two judges hearing the case, Arntzen and Arne Lyng, decided to order another evaluation to ensure that all the necessary evidence is presented during the trial, Engebretsen said. The psychiatrists are likely to start their interviews with Breivik in the next few days, he said. Breivik has told his lawyer he will not cooperate with another evaluation.  Prosecutors reported that prison staff and health workers had not seen evidence of psychotic behavior from Breivik, Arntzen said, as she gave the court\u2019s decision. The newly appointed psychiatrists will be able to watch video recordings of police interrogations and previous psychiatric interviews with Breivik to make sure they have the full picture, Arntzen added. Breivik is accused of killing eight people in a bomb attack in Oslo and 69 more in a gun rampage on nearby Utoya Island. The latter were among 700 mostly young people attending a Labour Party youth camp on the island. He has pleaded not guilty but admits carrying out the July 22 attacks, the judge handling his case has said previously. The trial, due to begin on April 16, is expected to last 10 weeks. In the previous evaluation, doctors found Breivik to be paranoid and schizophrenic, prosecutors said. The experts reached their conclusions after 36 hours of interviews with Breivik. He has been in custody since his arrest on Utoya Island on the day of the killings, which marked the deadliest attack in Norway since World War II. He now has access to the internet and other media, after a period during which he was kept isolated from the world, Engebretsen said."

        "content": "Police are to investigate claims that the British secret services were involved in the rendition of two men to Libya and their alleged ill treatment there, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police said Thursday. The investigation will take place now rather than at the end of a government inquiry into allegations of UK involvement in abuse of detainees, the police said in a joint statement with prosecutors. One of the cases involves Abdul Hakim Belhaj, a former leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group who became a senior revolutionary commander, while the second is Libyan citizen Saami Al-Saadi, officials confirmed. \u201cThe allegations raised in the two specific cases concerning the alleged rendition of named individuals to Libya and the alleged ill-treatment of them in Libya are so serious that it is in the public interest for them to be investigated now rather than at the conclusion of the Detainee Inquiry,\u201d the Metropolitan Police said in a joint statement with the director of public prosecutions. John Sawers, chief of the British foreign intelligence agency MI6, welcomed the decision in a statement Thursday. \u201cWe will of course be cooperating fully with the police on this new investigation, as we have done on the one now concluding,\u201d Sawers said. \u201cIt is in the service\u2019s interest to deal with the allegations being made as swiftly as possible so we can draw a line under them and focus on the crucial work we face now and in the future.\u201d A statement from the Cabinet Office said the government would also cooperate fully. \u201cThe government stands firmly against torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment,\u201d it said.  \u201cWe do not condone it, nor do we ask others to do it on our behalf. The security and intelligence agencies work tirelessly to protect us day in, day out.\u201d The Detainee Inquiry, to be headed by Peter Gibson, was ordered by Prime Minister David Cameron in 2010 but cannot start until all related criminal investigations have been concluded, meaning it may be further delayed by Thursday\u2019s decision. The inquiry\u2019s remit is \u201cto look systematically at the allegations about whether British personnel were in any way involved in the alleged mistreatment of detainees held by other countries,\u201d following the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, its website says. Last September it confirmed it would look into the claims of British involvement in renditions to Libya. Clive Stafford Smith, director of the legal action charity Reprieve, also welcomed Thursday\u2019s decision by police and prosecutors. Their statement made clear that \u201cBritish complicity in the torture of Libyans Sami al Saadi and Abdulhakim Belhaj by the Gaddafi regime is so blatant that a criminal inquiry must go ahead before the government\u2019s deeply flawed Gibson Inquiry can get started,\u201d he said. Al-Saadi, also known as Abu Munthir, is suing the British government and intelligence agencies for their alleged complicity in his rendition from Hong Kong to Tripoli in 2004 and subsequent inhuman detention, torture and abuse by the Libyan authorities, according to a letter from his lawyers placed online by Reprieve. Documents found at Libyan intelligence headquarters in Tripoli by campaign group Human Rights Watch last September highlighted the cooperation between Libya and Western intelligence agencies after Libya ended its weapons of mass destruction program in 2004. CNN saw an exchange of information between Libyan intelligence and Western intelligence agencies \u2013 such as the CIA, the MI6 in Britain and Canada\u2019s intelligence service \u2013 in documents dating from 2004 and 2005. They included a March 6, 2004, CIA letter to Libyan officials concerning Belhaj. British police and prosecutors also said they would not charge any individuals in relation to allegations of wrongdoing by British officials in two separate investigations, in their statement Thursday.  One, known as Operation Hinton, relates to claims that British intelligence officials were involved in the ill-treatment and torture of Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian-born British resident and former Guantanamo Bay inmate, while he was detained in Pakistan.  The other, Operation Iden, was set up to investigate possible criminal wrongdoing after an individual who was detained by U.S. authorities in Afghanistan was questioned by a member of the Secret intelligence Service, or MI6. Neither investigation produced evidence that would have led to a criminal conviction of an individual, the police and prosecutors concluded. But, they added, \u201cNothing in this decision should be read as concluding that the ill-treatment alleged by Mr Mohamed did not take place or that it was lawful.\u201d Stafford Smith welcomed that statement as \u201cthe first time any official in any country has conceded that Binyam Mohamed was tortured \u2013 and it is clear from this statement that the CPS accepts that Mr Mohamed was tortured and it was a criminal offense.\u201d It was unsurprising that the authorities had not found evidence to prosecute an individual in the case, he said.  \u201cBut the main focus of all this should not be the rank and file, but those who were signing off the torture policy at the top,\u201d he added, naming former Prime Minister Tony Blair among them. The police and CPS have also agreed to set up a panel to look into other claims of ill treatment of detainees and determine whether they should be investigated before the Detainee Inquiry concludes, Thursday\u2019s statement said."

The rising Czech star knew victory over Li Na in the semis would give her a chance to usurp Caroline Wozniacki by winning Friday\u2019s title match, but the 21-year-old lost 1-6 7-5 6-2 to China\u2019s defending champion. The 2011 Wimbledon winner squandered a great chance to go through as she led 3-1 in the second set against Li, who also earned her first grand slam last year at the French Open.  But the fourth seed battled back, winning five straight games to level the match and then 12 of the last 13 points in the third to wrap up victory. On the road: Barbados\u2019 twist on tennis \u201cIn the beginning I played really fast and well,\u201d Kvitova told the WTA Tour website. \u201cIt\u2019s normal if you play too well, you will come down a little bit. \u201cThat was the problem. It\u2019s life. She played very well. Many of us can be at the top, and she\u2019s one of us.\u201d Li was pleased with her form, after reaching her first WTA final since becoming China\u2019s first grand slam champion at Roland Garros last June. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m back,\u201d the 29-year-old said. \u201cI\u2019m feeling stronger, in the body and mind. I\u2019m just trying to do better \u2013 not like what I was doing the last half of last year.\u201d Li\u2019s opponent in Friday\u2019s final will be third seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, who came from behind to earn a 1-6 6-3 6-2 win over Wozniacki\u2019s quarterfinal conqueror, Polish seventh seed Agnieszka Radwanska. Wozniacki struggled with a wrist injury, but the 21-year-old Dane told reporters she hoped to take her place in the Melbourne line-up. In the Sydney men\u2019s event, 2010 champion Marcos Baghdatis earned a shock 7-6 (9-7) 6-4 quarterfinal victory over top seed and former world No. 4 Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina. Del Potro, the 2009 U.S. Open champion, wasted two set points in the tie-break before slipping to defeat in one hour and 40 minutes against the Cypriot, who reached the final of the 2006 Australian Open. Baghdatis\u2019 reward was a semifinal against France\u2019s Julien Benneteau, who won 6-2 6-4 against U.S-based Russian Alex Bogomolov Jr. Qualifier Denis Istomin continued his unlikely run in Sydney with a 6-4 7-6 (7-4) triumph over French third seed Richard Gasquet. The Uzbekistani, who has not dropped a set in six matches at the tournament, will next face experienced Finn Jarkko Nieminen \u2013 a 6-3 6-3 victor against American Bobby Reynolds. In Tasmania, defending champion and home favorite Jarmila Gajdosova crashed out of the Hobart International women\u2019s event with a 2-6 6-3 6-2 loss to German qualifier Mona Barthel. Barthel will face compatriot Angelique Kerber in the semifinals following the fourth seed\u2019s 6-0 3-6 7-5 win over Romania\u2019s Sorana Cirstea. Belgian top seed Yanina Wickmayer will meet Israel\u2019s Shahar Peer in the other semi after easing past Romania\u2019s Simona Halep 6-4 6-0. Sixth seed Peer went through when her Russian opponent Anna Chakvetadze was forced to retire due to severe leg cramps while trailing 4-6 6-4 1-0. Australian teenager Bernard Tomic earned a place in the final of the Kooyong Classic exhibition event in Melbourne, beating France\u2019s world No. 15 Gael Monfils 6-4 4-6 7-6 (7/2). The 19-year-old, ranked 37th, will next face either American world No. 8 Mardy Fish or Austria\u2019s Jurgen Melzer."

Schwartzel is aiming to become only the sixth player in European Tour history to win the same tournament three years in a row. However, electric storms halted play for more than four hours at both courses being played, leaving Schwartzel as one of the players unable to complete their rounds. New heart, new hope: Golfer Compton achieves PGA Tour dream Schwartzel was level par after 15 holes when bad light meant he could not continue, leaving him well behind the pace set by McGrane and Elson \u2013 who both carded eight-under-par rounds of 63. The pair are one stroke ahead of South African duo Desvonde Botes and Peter Karmis and Dutchman Reinier Saxton in the second event of the 2012 European Tour \u2013 one of only three tournaments on the circuit that uses more than one course. McGrane, world ranked 250, carded seven birdies and an eagle, with only a final hole bogey spoiling his round.  \u201cFor the last three or four years Irish golf has been quite incredible, and I think we feed off each other. For a small nation it sure is great to be there or thereabouts,\u201d McGrane \u2013 whose only previous victory came in the 2008 Volvo China Open \u2013 told the official European Tour website. \u201cI hit plenty of fairways and holed a few nice putts for birdie, it was just the bogey at the last which was disappointing. Apart from that it was a perfect round of golf,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, Elson matched McGrane\u2019s score on the Royal Johannesburg and Kensington West Course, as he celebrates returning to the Tour after coming through Qualifying School at the end of last year."

        "content": "For a player to succeed in the high pressured, multi-million dollar world of professional golf they must marry their special talent to an unshakable sense of determination. That shouldn\u2019t be a problem for U.S. PGA Tour rookie Erik Compton. After two heart transplants, the 32-year-old American has finally earned the chance to compete on the Tour, fulfilling a destiny that had seemed a distant dream.  \u201cWhat I did was pretty special, considering where I\u2019d been and what I\u2019d had to deal with,\u201d Compton told CNN ahead of his debut as a full-time card-holder in Hawaii this week. \u201cIt was very overwhelming. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it when I made the PGA Tour \u2013 I\u2019ve had to fight for everything my entire life, so you think, \u2018Did that really happen?\u2019 \u201d  Compton had been toiling on the second-tier Nationwide Tour, but victory at the Mexico Open helped him finish 13th on the money list and secured his place for 2012 alongside stars such as Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy. \u201cI got sick right after that tournament, I ended up in hospital, and the doctors put me on a lot of medication \u2013 that\u2019s when it sunk in and I realized what I\u2019d accomplished.\u201d RoboPutt: Rise of the golfing machines?  Compton was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy at the age of nine, a condition that limits the heart\u2019s capacity to pump blood, and had his first transplant three years later. Heavy medication restricted a sport-obsessed kid who was once bigger and faster than most of his peers, stunting his growth. But as he got stronger in his teens, his love for golf flourished. By 1998 Compton was ranked as the top junior in the United States, competing against \u2013 and beating \u2013 the likes of 2008 Masters champion Trevor Immelman and current world number six Adam Scott. But bad health still dogged his progress, and even caused him to pass out during an early attempt at the PGA Tour\u2019s qualifying school. After appearing in the Walker Cup, a team event between the best amateurs from the U.S. and Europe, he turned pro. Despite taking the order of merit on the Canadian Tour in 2004, and winning an event in Morocco in 2005, Compton was far from fulfilling his potential when his health began to deteriorate again in 2007. Fit-again Stricker scores win in Hawaii He was on course to make the cut at an event in Idaho, until a hook out of bounds on a closing hole resulted in him taking a nine shots and a making early exit from the tournament. As fate would have it, it was one of his worst shots that saved his life. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be alive if I had made that cut,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only reason I survived was because I was close enough to drive to the hospital when I felt a heart attack coming on and they put in a stent immediately.\u201d Compton\u2019s heart attack \u2013 known as a \u201cwidowmaker\u201d because few survive its intensity \u2013 forced another anxious period spent waiting for a donor. \u201cObviously, it put things in perspective, all I wanted to do was stay alive,\u201d he explained. \u201cI was sitting in a chair, coughing up blood \u2013 I couldn\u2019t breathe at night. I thought maybe I\u2019ll just have a house and live a quiet life. \u201cI never really enjoyed life until after a few weeks, the heart was shutting down, I couldn\u2019t sleep. Just doing simple things, lying down on couch watching TV, I would instantly start coughing up blood.\u201d Surviving one heart transplant, let alone two, is a feat to be proud of, but Compton says it took less than a week after surgery for his mind to turn to swinging a club again. Incredibly, just five months later he made a return to competitive action, tying for 60th at the Children\u2019s Miracle Network Classic on the PGA Tour \u2013 a high-pressure elite circuit where millions of dollars are at stake every weekend. His courage, and talent, propelled him into the limelight. \u201cThe surgeons thought I was crazy,\u201d he laughed. \u201cI slowly picked up my swing; I wasn\u2019t as strong as I am now but I figured out a way to get it done. I have a gift to be able to play sport and have the co-ordination to do it, so I\u2019ve been blessed that way \u2013 not so blessed in other things.\u201d Compton\u2019s desire to fulfill his dream of qualifying for a PGA Tour card helped to energize his recovery, as did the birth of his first child \u2013 another miracle given that doctors had been unsure if he\u2019d be able to have kids due to the medication he has taken all his life. He gradually regained full power but did have to seek special dispensation from the authorities to use a golf cart to get round the course, and to be absolved from their drug testing process, due to the medication that was vital for his survival. \u201cI got some letters from Ireland saying I was compromising the integrity of the game by using a cart and that Ben Hogan never would have done that! My goal was not to use it but, hey, there may be one day I have to use it again.\u201d In 2009 Compton received the Ben Hogan Award, for courage, presented to him by golfing legend Jack Nicklaus, and after two steady seasons he clinched his PGA Tour place with that momentous win in Mexico. \u201cThe whole of last season was tough, I was playing but I wasn\u2019t 100%,\u201d he said ahead of Thursday\u2019s opening round at the Sony Open. \u201cThis year coming up I\u2019m really excited playing on the Tour \u2013 I\u2019ve played a lot of events in the past but now I\u2019m healthy and I can handle a lot of it.  \u201cThe only issue I have is trying to capitalize \u2013 100% for me, is maybe 65-70% for someone else, so when I have a cold or I\u2019m not feeling the best it\u2019s hard to compete at a high level.  \u201cMy body has taken a hit over the years, I don\u2019t know the difference because I feel pretty strong, but that\u2019s the stuff I deal with on a day to day basis. My immune system is lower so I catch more colds and it takes me longer to fight them off but I\u2019m used to that.\u201d Compton\u2019s inspirational journey is sure to make even more headlines now that he will be playing side by side with the best golfers on the planet every week. \u201cI just try to live my own life and make the best out of what I can \u2013 if that inspires others then that\u2019s great. But I\u2019m just trying to live my life the best I can,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the message is more powerful than the game itself because it can touch everybody. I enjoy speaking my message to those who understand and get life, I don\u2019t enjoy telling it to people who don\u2019t understand. \u201cGolf has given me a reason to get out of my bed, so it\u2019s been very important. I\u2019m very blessed to have a passion and ability. Golf has kept me alive, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d"

        "content": "While the average American\u2019s understanding of the conflict in Kosovo is a simple, two-sided Sneetch-battle between the mountainous region\u2019s dominant Serbian minority and oppressed Albanian majority, the reality is a lot more convoluted than a Wikipedia page or morning radio parody of the Beach Boys\u2019 \u201cKokomo\u201d can accurately convey. In addition to the Serbs in the north and Albanians in the south, Kosovo is host to a pizza pie of smaller ethnic groups like Gorans, Illyrians, and Roma scattered in enclaves throughout the entire country.  During the 1998-1999 war, as the Serbian Yugoslav Army and NATO-backed Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army vied with each other to see who could rack up the most atrocities, these sub-minorities were victims of a disproportionate amount of collateral brutality. Especially the Kosovo Roma, more widely known as \u201cgypsies.\u201d Of the 250,000 people displaced from their homes by the fighting, an estimated 90,000 were Roma, a figure which is a little more jarring when you realize the region\u2019s total Romani population is just a little north of 100,000.  To help them deal with the refugee problem, the United Nations invited Paul Polansky, an American activist for gypsy rights, then working in Prague, to the city of Mitrovica to act as a liaison for the burgeoning community of Roma\u2019s so-called Internally Displaced People.  \u201cThe UN were having gypsies running into schoolhouses seeking shelter from the Albanians who were chasing them out of their homes,\u201d says Polansky from his house in Southern Serbia. \u201cAnd so they opened a few Internally Displaced People camps, but they didn\u2019t know how to work with the gypsies, so they needed an expert to actually move into the camps to live with them and advise them. That\u2019s what they brought me to Kosovo to do.\u201d  Polansky was immediately unimpressed by the conditions at the camp he moved into an old French army barracks called Osterode.  See the rest of The VICE guide to the Balkans at VICE.com  \u201cThere were about 1,800 tents put up by the 23rd Pioneer Regiment of the British Army. They were put on toxic wasteland. The land itself was lower than the road coming into the camp and so when it rained there was water in all the tents. The only food they were given was flour and beans. They needed water to cook with but there was no water for cooking, no water for cleaning, and when I complained to the UN they said, \u2018Well, these are gypsies, they know how to look after themselves.\u2019 It was a constant fight just to get them to deliver water. We were not guaranteed any security. The Albanians were attacking the camp. We had children die because UN police refused to take them to hospital\u201d  Despite Polansky\u2019s efforts, conditions at the Osterode camp continued to deteriorate. The British regiment in charge of protecting the camp was withdrawn and children began to show symptoms of health effects from the campsite\u2019s proximity to dumping grounds for industrial waste.  \u201cIn 1999, some Danish soldiers on patrol in Mitroviza had shown symptoms of lead poisoning,\u201d Polansky told us. \u201cSo their blood was taken, and it came back they had extremely high levels of lead poisoning. So in the summer of 2000, a UN medical team took blood tests all over Mitrovica. They found the highest lead levels were in the gypsy camps because they had been built on the tailings stands of the mines and the pollution from the smelter drifted right over their camp. Their blood samples were sent to a lab in Belgium and it was found that the children in these camps had the highest lead levels in medical literature.\u201d  Eventually Polansky got fed up with the UN\u2019s administration of the camps (or lack thereof), cut his ties with the organization, and led a large group of gypsies on a protest march to the Macedonian border.   The UN responded to his accusations of negligence, saying it was investigating the matter and that they \u201cdo not think that it would be useful to discuss the matter at this time, given that the the review of this matter is ongoing.\u201d  We were curious how this \u201cmatter\u201d was going, so we decided to stop by the camp and talk to some of the residents who still haven\u2019t been evacuated from the site that is killing their children. Twelve years down the road."

        "content": "Captain Steven Gerrard scored the only goal from the penalty spot as Liverpool beat Manchester City 1-0 in Wednesday\u2019s first leg of their English League Cup semifinal. Gerrard made no mistake with his 13th-minute spot-kick, after City defender Stefan Savic had fouled Daniel Agger in the area, to give Liverpool a narrow advantage to take into the second leg at Anfield in a fortnight. The winners will face either Crystal Palace or Cardiff City, who both play in the second-tier Championship, in next month\u2019s final at Wembley Stadium. It was City\u2019s second home defeat in three days, having been knocked out of the FA Cup by Manchester United on Sunday. It is in stark contrast to the club\u2019s Premier League form, where the leaders have won all 10 matches played at the Etihad Stadium. Who are football\u2019s top January transfer targets? City had a great chance to level in the second half when Sergio Aguero intercepted Martin Kelly\u2019s poor back-pass, but goalkeeper Pep Reina narrowed the angle and the Argentina international fired over the bar. Aguero also squandered an opportunity from close range soon after, but his unmarked header failed to find the target. Meanwhile, Tottenham drew level with second-placed United in the Premier League, after a comfortable 2-0 home victory over Everton on Wednesday left the London club three points behind City. The home side went ahead 10 minutes before halftime when England winger Aaron Lennon cut inside defender Leighton Baines and evaded Sylvain Distin\u2019s challenge before coolly slotting home. Leftback Benoit  Assou-Ekotto sealed victory in the 63rd minute when the Cameroon international slammed in a superb 30-yard drive for his first goal since August 2009. The result lifted Tottenham eight points clear of fourth-placed London rivals Chelsea.  Meanwhile, there was a shock result in the last 16 of the Italian Cup as Serie A title hopefuls Udinese lost 2-1 at home to Chievo. Udinese lie in third place in the league table having won eight and drawn the other of their nine home matches. However, substitute Cyril Thereau\u2019s injury-time winner earned the visitors a quarterfinal trip to Siena. Roma booked a last-eight tie with second-placed Serie A side Juventus as Argentine midfielder  Erik Lamela scored twice in a 3-0 home win over Fiorentina."

The ambition the club has for the future also persuaded me to join.\u201d Paris St Germain, who appointed Italian Carlo Ancelotti as their new coach late last year and are boosted by funds from their cash-rich Qatari owners, are currently three points clear at the top of the French table."

The 43-year-old appeared the main challenger to car leader Stephane Peterhansel after winning both Monday and Tuesday\u2019s stages, cutting the French driver\u2019s advantage to almost six minutes. However, the ultimate decision over Gordon\u2019s fate rests with the French Automobile Sport Federation (FFSA), who must deliver their verdict within two months, although the loser could still appeal to motorsport\u2019s global governing body, the FIA, should he be thrown out of the race. The stewards believe that Gordon\u2019s modifying of the ventilation system, linked to his engine, improves its performance level \u2013 a claim he denies. That appeal allowed Gordon to continue racing in the 377-kilometer 10th stage from Iquique to Arica in Chile, although his hopes took a further knock as he subsequently lost 15 minutes to stage winner Nani Roma of Spain after suffering damage to his car. \u201cI hit a rock with both right-side tires and, as you can see, this wheel is way out, so we\u2019ve got some broken parts,\u201d Gordon told reporters.

        "content": "Sylvin Barnett makes a living driving a forklift for a beer company, but his real passion is on the road. The 41-year-old is a leading exponent of a little-known offshoot of tennis that has made him a celebrity in his native Barbados, and he hopes that its appeal will go global. Road Tennis is a fast and furious scaled-down version of the sport which can be played almost anywhere, and has attracted the interest of stars such as Andy Murray and Venus Williams.  It\u2019s a bit like table tennis, but without the table. \u201cI would love to see us grow not only in the Caribbean but in Europe,\u201d Barnett says. \u201cIt would be great to see our guys working in schools all over the world, spreading the word.\u201d The recipe is simple. Find a hard flat surface, indoors or outside.  Mark out a court 20 x 10 feet (6 x 3 meters) using chalk or preferably tape. Erect a \u201cnet\u201d \u2013 usually made of plywood \u2013 standing eight inches (20 centimeters) high. The bats are similar to those used in table tennis, but without the rubber. The balls are of the tennis variety but without the fur, and deflated to reduce bounce. The first player to score 21 points wins, with each taking five serves in turn. \u201cWe have a vision to get it in as many countries as possible,\u201d says Dale Clarke, chief executive of the Professional Road Tennis Association. \u201cThe game is addictive, once you start you always want to play,\u201d the 35-year-old told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019ve had requests from Germany, Sweden and America for more information.\u201d When Barnett was asked to go to London to take part in a promotional video with world No. 4 Murray, former world heavyweight boxing champion David Haye and other Bajan Road Tennis stars, he jumped at the chance. Murray beat Haye after a quick run-through of the basics, but went down 21-16 to his Barbadian opponent. \u201cI took it easy on him!\u201d Barnett told CNN. \u201cBut seriously, Andy was a great guy and showed a genuine interest in our sport.\u201d Murray, for his part, enjoyed the challenge \u201cIt\u2019s very, very different to tennis, and I quite like that,\u201d the Briton told CNN. \u201cThe guys are some of the best at that game, so were a whole lot better than me, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d  According to the official Professional Road Tennis website, the sport was first played in the 1930s in the parish of St Michael. It earned the label \u201cpoor man\u2019s tennis\u201d because pieces of wood, or even even hard-cover books, were used as rackets. In essence, little has changed since, but plywood soon became the popular choice for the bats and the \u201cskinning\u201d of the tennis balls became widespread. West Indian cricket legend Brian Lara, who hails from Trinidad, is a notable fan of the sport, while France\u2019s Gael Monfils is among the top tennis players who have tried it on visits to Barbados \u2013 which is best known as a tropical paradise for holidaymakers. Barnett has been playing since he was 12, and says he can still compete with the likes of current world champion Julian White because \u201cexperience counts for a lot.\u201d There is prize money at stake for the Caribbean island\u2019s 150 active players, but Road Tennis remains semi-professional. Barnett spends a lot of time coaching and spreading the gospel about his sport, but believes its promotion has been lacking. \u201cOur main challenge is our governing bodies in Barbados take sport too lightly, it\u2019s one of the reasons it hasn\u2019t reached other Caribbean countries. We have to do better, \u201d he says."

Clarence House releases the list of gifts each year, but a spokesman told CNN he could not specify which ones the royals have used themselves, which have been put on display and which have gone into storage. The gifts include those presented to Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge; as well as Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall; by individuals as well as governments and official bodies. Prince William made a solo trip to New Zealand and Australia, both Commonwealth nations, in March, shortly before his wedding in April.  Among the gifts he received in New Zealand were carved and inscribed fragments of buildings in Christchurch, the city rocked by a series of powerful earthquakes in 2010 and 2011.

He was also treated to a jar of Vegemite, a yeast extract spread popular with Australians that is eaten on toast. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard tried to convert President Barack Obama to the vegetarian spread while visiting the United States in March \u2013 without success. In June and July, William and Catherine traveled together to Canada and the United States, in what was their first official visit as a married couple \u2013 and her first experience of a royal tour. There William, himself a qualified search-and-rescue pilot, received gifts including a flight helmet by the Canadian Air Force and a Canadian Ranger Patrol knife. Catherine, meanwhile, was given fascinators in tartan and peacock feather, as well as an assortment of scarves, dresses, shoes and jewelry. The newlyweds were jointly treated to matching black hoodies by Calgary Rotary Challenge Park, as well as a pair of chef\u2019s jackets, after taking a cooking class in Montreal. The Ministry of Health gave them two mosquito traps, while their creature comforts were also taken care of with gifts of whiskey, wine and champagne. The couple\u2019s stay in the United States was more low-key, with gifts including coasters, a bread board and a copy of the Chicago Daily Sun & Times newspaper. Among the more exotic gifts presented to Charles and Camilla were a \u201ccamel saddle and trappings\u201d in Morocco. Weapons were also taken care of with the presentation of a ceremonial sword in Kuwait, a dagger in Morocco and a set of Zulu spears and shields in South Africa, not to mention a beaded hunting stick presented by Maasai tribal leaders in Tanzania. In Spain and Portugal, local produce came to the fore, with bottles of olive oil and port, jars of marmalade and ham on the list. Spain\u2019s own royal family opted to give the couple two books and a leather box of fruit and vegetable seeds. According to Clarence House, no gifts can be sold but the royals can choose to give perishable produce to local good causes like hospitals or hospices. The rest will either be kept safely in storage or put on display in St James\u2019s Palace, Clarence House or other private residences, a spokesman said.  The presents are not considered the personal property of their royal recipients, although they can be worn or used by them, and are kept in trust for the nation. "

Verona pulled level through Emanuele Berrettoni and Marco D\u2019Alessandro before Brazilian Hernanes sealed Lazio\u2019s win with a stoppage-time free-kick. Lazio will now play either AC Milan or Novara in the last eight. And in France, two-time defending League Cup champions Marseille made it through to the semifinals with a 3-0 win over Caen. Midfielder Mathieu Valbuena scored twice."

        "content": "Nasser Al-Attiyah has called time on the defense of his Dakar Rally title, pulling out of the 2012 race after problems with his car. The Qatari quit the annual race across South America after his temperamental Hummer broke down on the ninth stage between Antofagasta and Iquique in Chile. Al-Attiyah has endured a litany of problems with his vehicle since the start of the race on New Year\u2019s Day and threw in the towel after 174km of the ninth stage having made three unscheduled stops. American Bobby Gordon didn\u2019t have any such problems as he claimed his first stage win in the 2012 race to further close the gap on overall leader Stephane Peterhansel. Gordon cuts Peterhansel\u2019s lead in stage eight The Frenchman \u2013 a six-time motorbike and three-time car champion in the Dakar \u2013 finished a minute and 38 seconds behind Gordon, with Spain\u2019s Nani Roma third. With four days remaining in the race Gordon, a NASCAR veteran, trails Peterhansel by nearly six minutes in the overall standings. He said: \u201cWe had a couple of big scary moments. For us, we\u2019ve got to make time. We\u2019re in a different position to him (Peterhansel). He has to conserve his time and I\u2019ve got to make it.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got four days left, four real days of racing left and the Hummer\u2019s strong. I can\u2019t believe he could catch us there, because we were going crazy. So he\u2019s a madman; if he beats us, he\u2019s a madman. Madder than me!\u201d In the motorbike classification, Cyril Despres won stage nine to return to the top of the overall standings in his seesaw battle with Spain\u2019s Mark Como. The Frenchman, who got stuck in a patch of mud for ten minutes during stage eight, bounced back to triumph in the 606km stretch with Como coming in second. Despres now leads Como by two minutes 28 seconds in the overall standings. He told the Dakar Rally\u2019s official website: \u201cAfter a difficult day yesterday when you start to doubt, I had to get back to winning ways.  \u201cIt\u2019s very competitive. Like any top level sportsman, if you don\u2019t like confrontation or squeezing the last ounces of strength out of yourself, then you\u2019re not ready for a fight. But, as for me, I\u2019m up for it.\u201d"

        "content": "FIFA\u2019s head of security has told CNN that match-fixing in soccer is fueled by an illegal gambling market of up to $1 trillion and says governments must work together to stamp out the problem. Chris Eaton, a former head of international crime agency Interpol, has been tasked by world football\u2019s governing body with breaking up a lucrative underground industry. The Australian says the amount of money involved in modern day soccer has alerted criminal gangs to the possibility of making vast sums by trying to influence the outcome of top level matches. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about international, transcontinental, organized crime taking advantage of the enormous pot of money available in global gambling,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Pedro Pinto. Inter Milan enter the race for Tevez \u201cMost of this is in the illegal gambling market out of Southeast Asia. Estimates vary from between $500 billion to $1 trillion so we\u2019re talking about money that attracts organized crime of course because this is digital money or cash.\u201d FIFA announced Tuesday it would appeal to Interpol to help the fight against match fixing, establish an amnesty for those who provide relevant information and send officials to Asia, the Americas and the Middle East to try to fix the problem. It also released a document sent by Wilson Raj Perumal, a Singapore-based in London who specialized in match-fixing, instructing an unspecified national team to concede two goals in each half for a reward of $100,000.  He is currently serving a two-year prison sentence. Eaton said FIFA must send a clear message in 2012 that it will prosecute those who take part in fixing. Who are football\u2019s top January transfer targets? \u201cWe need to set a baseline of behavior where players, referees and administrators understand that if you cross that line, FIFA will take action against you and you will not be involved in football again,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not ad-hoc opportunistic match fixing, this is criminally-planned sports results manipulation and it needs the collective commitment of governments.\u201d Eaton said there have been no specific allegations relating to major European competitions such as the English Premier League, but he warned the reach of some of the gangs cannot be underestimated. \u201cWe cannot say simply because a particular league is the wealthiest or most watched in the world that it is immune from criminal infiltration,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing is immune. We have credible allegations about major regional competitions and international friendlies. These are high-level matches by anyone\u2019s imagination.\u201d"

Inter\u2019s confirmation that the Manchester City striker is on the Italian Serie A club\u2019s wanted list means a two-way race between the stadium-sharing rivals, with France\u2019s Paris Saint-Germain lurking as an outside chance. \u201cWe don\u2019t do anything just for fun; if we do something it\u2019s because we think it could be a good deal,\u201d Inter president Massimo Moratti told the club\u2019s website. \u201cWe were interested in finding out how things stood, if there was any room for maneuver. We\u2019ll see if we\u2019re successful, if we can bring him here or not.\u201d Who are January\u2019s top transfer targets? Milan had been in pole position to sign the Argentina international, who has not played a club match for three months after falling out with City manager Roberto Mancini over his refusal to warm up during a European Champions League game. However, Mancini\u2019s desire to raise funds for his own signings means that Milan\u2019s offer of an initial loan deal has not been gladly received. Milan chief Adriano Galliani has indicated that the Italian champions are prepared to wait until the end of the January transfer window as they seek a replacement for Antonio Cassano, who is sidelined after a heart operation. Moratti also suggested there is no need to rush any deal. \u201cThere are three weeks left. There\u2019s plenty of time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of being optimistic or not, just waiting to see what happens.\u201d Mancini, however, is hoping for a speedy solution as he seeks to bolster a squad hit by suspensions, injuries and the departure of Yaya and Kolo Toure to the African Cup of Nations. \u201cI hope there will be a good result for him in January because he has not played for three months,\u201d the former Inter coach said ahead of Wednesday\u2019s English League Cup semifinal first-leg tie with Liverpool. Mancini had hoped to have captain Vincent Kompany available for that home match, but the defender\u2019s appeal against the red card he received in Sunday\u2019s 3-2 FA Cup defeat by Manchester United was dismissed by the English Football Association on Tuesday.  The Belgium international will be sidelined for four matches, including the away leg and Premier League clashes with Wigan and third-placed Tottenham. Inter downplayed reports suggesting that Dutch playmaker Wesley Sneijder \u2013 a longtime target of City\u2019s rivals United \u2013 could be involved in any deal for Tevez. \u201cRegarding reports from the British media, Inter Milan technical director Marco Branca wishes to underline and clarify the situation immediately that there were no discussions whatsoever regarding Wesley Sneijder during our meeting in London with representatives of Manchester City,\u201d the club said in a statement. Meanwhile, former Manchester City manager Mark Hughes has returned to football after being appointed by Premier League strugglers Queens Park Rangers to replace the sacked Neil Warnock.  The ex-Manchester United and Chelsea player, who was Mancini\u2019s predecessor at City, signed a two-and-half-year contract on Tuesday. The 48-year-old had been out of work since leaving QPR\u2019s south-west London rivals Fulham in June 2011 after less than a year in charge after claiming the club did not match his ambitions. However, QPR owner Tony Fernandes has persuaded the former Wales player and coach to take over a team battling to avoid an immediate return to the second division."

Cantona has written to French mayors to obtain the 500 signatures needed to stand in April\u2019s election, Liberation newspaper reported. The 45-year-old told them he was \u201ca citizen very much aware of our times,\u201d and would stand up for the young and poorly housed. But the bid was interpreted by Liberation as a way of publicizing his cause of better housing, rather than a genuine presidential campaign. Nicolas Sarkozy of the UMP party is bidding for re-election in April against Socialist rival Francois Hollande. See high-res images of other sports stars-turned-politicians Cantona\u2019s move is just the latest in a varied career by the Frenchman. Since leaving Old Trafford in 1997 where he was known as \u201cKing Eric\u201d for his goal-scoring prowess, Cantona has turned to acting, most notably in director Ken  Loach\u2019s \u201cLooking For Eric.\u201d And in 2010 Cantona urged bank customers to withdraw all their money from French banks. The call prompted widespread condemnation by politicians, and few people took out their cash.  Finance Minister Francois Baroin, who is also a mayor, dismissed his latest move, adding that he preferred \u201cthe Cantona who looks after housing to the Cantona who told the French to withdraw their money from the banks in order to cause a disaster.\u201d Cantona gained notoriety in 1995 when he launched a flying kick and several punches at a fan as he was sent off during a match. After the game, he told journalists: \u201cWhen the seagulls follow the trawler, it\u2019s because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea.\u201d Last year Cantona, voted by Manchester United fans as their player of the century, was named as director of football for the newly-reformed New York Cosmos.  Many other sports stars have made the move into politics.

        "content": "Turkey moved one step closer to prosecuting the senior commanders behind a military coup in 1980 when a Turkish court approved on Tuesday a prosecutor\u2019s indictment of retired army general and former president Kenan Evren, semi-official Anatolian Agency reported. Ankara\u2019s 12th Heavy Crime Court also announced retired air force chief Tahsin Sahinkaya was included in the indictment. According to Anatolian, the indictment suggests life imprisonment for Evren and Sahinkaya for allegedly committing \u201cacts against the forces of the state.\u201d  Some Turkish media have drawn parallels to the landmark prosecution of Chile\u2019s once unassailable military dictator Augusto Pinochet. Evren, now 94, led the overthrow of the Turkish government when he ordered tanks out into the streets of the capital in the pre-dawn hours of September 12, 1980. The overthrow brought an end to years of bloody killings between right- and left-wing Turkish militants, and many prominent voices in Turkey and abroad initially welcomed the coup. A Time magazine cover from the time even featured a \u201cpaternalistic portrait of General Evren clasping a collage of the Istanbul skyline in his arms with the caption \u2018Holding Turkey Together\u2019,\u201d according to \u201cTurkey Unveiled, a History of Modern Turkey.\u201d But in the aftermath of the military take-over, accounts of human rights abuses began to emerge. Hundreds of thousands of people were thrown in jail, many of them tortured. The military junta also disbanded political parties, jailed senior politicians, and sentenced hundreds of people to death.  \u201cSeptember 12th is the mother of all coups in Turkey\u2019s history,\u201d said Yasemin Congar, columnist and deputy editor of the Turkish daily newspaper \u201cTaraf.\u201d  \u201cIt damaged the whole country and probably caused incurable damage on one whole generation of the youth in this society.\u201d Hugh Pope, co-author of \u201cTurkey Unveiled,\u201d said the coup \u201cbrought Turkish politics back to the kindergarten.\u201d \u201c[Evren] somehow wanted to force the politicians to be less conflictual, but he did so by dumbing them down to the point that Turkey\u2019s political system is still recovering from it,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately the consequences of his actions ruined so many people\u2019s lives. One has to wonder how Turkey is going to deal with that.\u201d According to an article in the Turkish constitution, which was written by the military junta in 1982, Evren and his fellow officers were protected from prosecution. But recent constitutional changes drafted and ratified by prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s ruling Justice and Development Party cleared the way for a prosecutor to question Evren at his home last year. Erdogan\u2019s government has also overseen the arrest and trial of dozens of other army generals accused of a much more recent military coup plot, which was never successfully carried out. According to Anatolian Agency, authorities arrested retired general Hursit Tolon on Tuesday in connection to the more recent plot.  And last week, authorities detained retired general Ilker Basbug, who commanded the Turkish armed forces until 2010. Some critics have called the prosecutions a witch hunt, targeting political opponents of Erdogan\u2019s government. Other argue it has been a vital process to bring the military under the control of elected civilian leaders. Since 1960, the once politically-dominant Turkish armed forces have overthrown four governments.  \u201cEnding the belief of impunity is very, very important,\u201d said Congar of \u2018Taraf\u2019 newspaper, which has published many damning reports about the Turkish military in recent years. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge step, obviously very late. These generals are very old. But it\u2019s still symbolically very important for this country.\u201d "

A fourth work was dropped by the thief, or thieves, during their getaway. The Picasso portrait, which depicts a woman in a white blouse against a blue background, is inscribed on the reverse: \u201cFor the Greek people, a tribute from Picasso.\u201d It was donated by the artist in 1946.

        "content": "American golfer Steve Stricker showed that his injury problems are behind him as he wrapped up a three-shot victory at the season-opening Tournament of Champions in Hawaii. Four months ago, Stricker was forced to withdraw from the BMW Championship with a neck problem which restricted movement in his left arm and cast doubts over his future on the PGA Tour. The 44-year-old opted to undergo a course of physiotherapy and cortisone injections rather than surgery, a decision which paid dividends when he held off the challenge of Scotland\u2019s Martin Laird at the Plantation Course in Kapalua on Monday to secure his 12th PGA Tour title. What if robots ruled golf? \u201cI was comfortable today,\u201d Stricker told the tour\u2019s website. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was really proud of.\u201d Just as he had done on Sunday, the world number five allowed a five-shot overnight lead to slip to just a single stroke.  A bogey at the sixth hole left Stricker within striking distance for the chasing pack of Laird and fellow Americans Webb Simpson and defending champion Jonathan Byrd. But Stricker, who reached a career-high ranking of second in February 2010, rallied and hit five birdies over the final 12 holes for a 69 which moved him onto 23 under par for the tournament. He has now won nine PGA events since turning 40, and eight since 2009. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s me or anybody else,\u201d Stricker said. \u201cAlways in the final round, it gets close at some point in time. It\u2019s just the nature of our game.  \u201cI think you\u2019re able to lose your patience much more at a younger age and just kind of \u2013 not give up, but just feel like it\u2019s not going to go your way. Believe me, I\u2019ve felt like that at times.  \u201cBut you\u2019ve just got to keep hanging in there. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s a challenge. But it\u2019s worth it \u2013 especially when it works out in the end.\u201d Laird finished second on 20 under after carding 67, leaving him one shot clear of third-placed Simpson (68) and Byrd (68).  World No. 33 Laird described Stricker as \u201cthe most underrated player in the world.\u201d K.J. Choi posted an eight-under 65, the joint-best round of the day alongside the 2011 PGA Championship winner Keegan Bradley, which gave the veteran South Korean a share of fifth with American Harrison Frazar (68) on 15 under.   Bradley had a disappointing tournament, but finished with a flourish to move onto 11 under and place 16th in the 27-man field. Chris Kirk (67) and Bryce Molder (70) tied for seventh on 14 under, while fellow Americans Johnson Wagner (67) and Ben Crane (68) finished in a three-way tie for ninth alongside South Africa\u2019s Rory Sabbatini (68)."

        "content": "What if robots ruled the world of golf? A fanciful notion perhaps, but already many tasks formerly performed by humans are now carried out by mechanical devices. And the same maxim is very much in evidence in golf, where products such as balls and clubs only reach the marketplace after being tested to perfection using robotic technology. One developer has mooted the possibility of metal caddies and robot suits to help with coaching, in a sport where human error on the course is cruelly exposed. An industry leader in this field is California-based Golf Laboratories Inc., whose founder Gene Parente saw a gap in the market when he started his company in 1990 \u2013 and is now hoping to invent a fully robotic player. \u2018Iron Byron\u2019 led the way  Two decades ago, cutting-edge technology centered around a robotic-armed machine nicknamed \u201cThe Iron Byron\u201d (after legendary U.S. golfer Byron Nelson). It relied on air pressure and pneumatics to generate club-head speed. The contraption was effectively a giant garage door spring, with three speeds: slow, medium and fast. Iron Byron\u2019s drawback was that it could only swing one way, whereas no \u201chuman\u201d swing is exactly the same. Parente and his partner Sean Dynes incorporated robot technology and computer control drive systems to produce a much more sophisticated testing mechanism. \u201cIf you can swing a golf club, we can simulate it,\u201d Parente told CNN. The approach has revolutionized the industry, enabling manufacturers to tailor their equipment to golfers of different abilities \u2013 because not everyone has the athleticism to generate the 130 mph club-head speed of a Woods or a Bubba Watson. But Parente is not content with that level of perfection, and decided to take his company\u2019s innovations a stage further with a prototype robot golfer that will take to the course and hopefully battle the pros. \u201cIt\u2019s more for the entertainment aspect than anything else,\u201d admitted Parente, who said he was in talks with partners to develop the project. Limited capability Technology has clearly come a long way since the Sony Corporation introduced Qrio to the world in 2004. The likeable robot figure may have been able to hand the winner\u2019s check to Ernie Els at the Japanese company\u2019s sponsored PGA Tour tournament, but its capability was limited. At public demonstrations it could merely putt a ball into a large hole on a mat. Parente\u2019s ambitions extend a little further, inspired by the likes of the computer Deep Blue taking on chess grandmasters before large televised audiences. \u201cTo be able to tackle something as difficult as golf takes this to another level,\u201d he said. While \u201cMan versus Robot\u201d has an obvious appeal, the majority of commercial applications in golf and other areas are generally based on the principle of \u201cRobot helping Man.\u201d Perhaps this is because, as Parente flags up, there is a \u201cfascination/fear\u201d of the Terminator movie scenario where humans are enslaved by a ruthless robotic super race \u2013 a similar theme also explored in the film RoboCop. But as Indianapolis-based company Precise Path Inc. has proved, robots can be put to more peaceful purposes and are very good at mowing grass. They have spent over five years perfecting the technology that sees its patented mower able to cut golf course greens and fairways to perfection. Robot mower ready to roll The robot mower is programed by its users to carry out work on a designated part of the course, and will carry on with the task to completion, come rain or shine. Jason Zielke, chief operating officer and president of Precise Path, claims their product will change the face of golf course maintenance.  \u201cRemoving humans from that process has the combined benefit of a significant improvement in quality and consistency,\u201d he told CNN. Precise Path was used for one half of a course in Florida, with normal green-keeping staff cutting the grass on the other. Zielke claimed the greens mowed by the robot \u201crolled about a foot faster\u201d than the others; in other words, they were smoother and better running. Precise Path will go to market in 2012 and Zielke believes its applications will extend to other sports playing fields and public open spaces, saving large amounts in upkeep costs and freeing up staff for other duties. Such advanced technology is expensive and remains outside the budget of the ordinary household, so robots cutting your lawn at home or employed in other tasks such as vacuum cleaning may be a little way off. But according to Rich Mahoney, the director of robotics at California\u2019s SRI International, the technologies employed in robotics and modern consumer electronics are converging.  Increased availability  \u201cThe cost of some robots is decreasing and the availability of certain types of robots is increasing,\u201d said Mahoney, whose research team is developing low-cost technologies and robotic applications. Extending this to golf, one of these might be in the form of your own personal caddy. \u201cImagine a machine that carried your bag and could also give you advice based on every shot you have taken in the last year?\u201d he told CNN. For some this would be a nightmare scenario, but it would bring an end to those spats between player and caddy when each blames the other for a poor shot! Mahoney can see other applications in the form of coaching aids. \u201cA robotic suit, a form of \u2018super suit\u2019 that guides your movements as you wear it, helping you to learn how to better swing the golf club,\u201d he explained. For the time being, much of this remains in the future, but back in San Diego Parente is confident his robot golfer will hit the fairways soon and cause quite a stir. But he is struggling to come up with a catchy name for his creation like \u201cIron Byron\u201d and has settled on Golf Laboratories Computer Controlled Robot.  So Parente is hoping his creation will do the talking for him."

        "content": "Almost six months after Japan\u2019s women gave the country a much-needed boost by winning the football World Cup, the team was again celebrating after scooping a hat-trick of prestigious awards.   At a ceremony in Zurich, Switzerland late Monday, Homare Sawa was crowned FIFA Women\u2019s World Player of the Year after she captained Japan to the Women\u2019s World Cup title in Germany, while her manager Norio Sasaki was named coach of the year. \u201cI couldn\u2019t comprehend it when my name was called,\u201d Sawa told reporters Tuesday. \u201cI felt like I was in a dream, just like the World Cup. There are so many great players out there. It was an unimaginable moment, walking up to the podium, being among all those people.\u201d  Japan\u2019s Football Association also picked up the FIFA Fair Play Award in recognition of the hardships the country endured following the earthquake and tsunami that devastated large parts of Japan on March 11 last year. Team skipper Sawa, dressed in a traditional kimono, was joined on stage by JFA president Junji Ogura to receive the accolade.  \u201cIt\u2019s a great honor for JFA to receive such a prestigious award from FIFA,\u201d said Ogura. \u201cWe will do our best to continue to prepare in our activities. We are very proud in this award.\u201d Japan\u2019s surprise victory in Germany in July last year denied the much-fancied U.S. team a record third title. They even battled back twice after going a goal behind. But even as the team progressed through the competition against the odds, it became about more than just football or a trophy. Their exploits were inspiring a country that had suffered so much. \u201cAfter the disaster, the whole country was in the spirit of trying their best. What we saw was the soul of Japan,\u201d one fan, Yasushi Tsuha, told CNN after watching the match at a Tokyo bar. Despite the fact the game kicked off at almost 4 a.m. local time, men and women flocked to watch the game. By the end of the epic clash, there were few dry eyes in the bar as the victorious Japanese players lifted the World Cup trophy for the first time.  They were overcome with emotion and pride in a team that few knew anything about before this competition. \u201cWhen I see women like me giving so much spirit, it gives me energy to keep going in my daily life,\u201d said another fan Ayako Nishi. The national team left Japan bound for the tournament with little fanfare. A month later, they were swamped by jubilant fans as they arrived back at Tokyo\u2019s Narita airport as national heroes. Their success looks likely to continue in 2012, after the Nadeshiko qualified comfortably for the Olympic Games in London later this summer."

        "content": "Thierry Henry made a sensational scoring return for English club Arsenal as his goal sealed a 1-0 win over Leeds United in the third round of the FA Cup. The French striker came on as a substitute and sealed the match with a trademark finish after less than ten minutes on the pitch to enhance his legend at the London club still further. Arsenal\u2019s highest ever scorer left the club for Spanish side Barcelona in 2007 and was making his first appearance since sealing a two-month loan move from Major League Soccer side the New York Red Bulls. The 34-year-old received a huge ovation when he came on a replacement for Moroccan forward Marouane Chamakh in the 68th minute and he found the net ten minutes later. Who are football\u2019s top January transfer targets? He finished emphatically past Leeds goalkeeper Andy Lonergan to send the Emirates Stadium into raptures and register his 227th goal for the club. It sent Arsenal through to the fourth round at the expense of Leeds, who play in the second tier of English football. Arsenal will now face fellow Premier League side Aston Villa in the next round. Rooney defiant as Man City appeal Kompany red card After his perfect return Henry told ESPN: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird. I came back from holiday 15 days ago. I never thought I was going to play for Arsenal again or score a winner. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. I love the club and I hope I can do more. I hope it won\u2019t be the last one. The feeling I had when I scored was amazing. \u201cI rejoined the club as a fan; before I wasn\u2019t. Scoring a goal when you support the team, now I know how some of the guys who played for Liverpool or Man United or Chelsea felt when they scored a goal for the club they support. \u201cWith one opportunity, it\u2019s very important \u2013 you don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll have a second. You have to make sure you take it. I took it well.\u201d Henry\u2019s goal was his 12th in 12 games against Leeds United, who were relegated from the Premier League in 2004. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think about that but I think I will always remember tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to Arsenal something happens with me, sometimes in a bad way but most of the time in history in a good way.\u201d Henry was named man of the match despite being on the field for just 22 minutes. He added: \u201cI think it\u2019s a joke, but I\u2019ll take it.\u201d Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger added: \u201cYou could see Thierry brought his class but also how much it means to him to come on and make the difference. It was something you couldn\u2019t even predict before the game. \u201cIt\u2019s great that he\u2019s back here and got the goal that qualifies us. You see that when he gets in these kind of positions, we\u2019ve seen it so many times, him finishing at the right moment. It looks easy but it\u2019s not.\u201d"

Peterhansel suffered a puncture 30km from the end of the stage between Copiapo and Antofagasta and saw his overall lead whittled down to seven minutes 36 seconds by Gordon. The American lost out to Roma, from Spain, by just five seconds and is still awaiting his first stage win in the 2012 rally. Defending champion Nasser Al-Attiyah, from Qatar, was disrupted by technical problems and had to stop on several occasions. He now trails Peterhansel by over 45 minutes. Pole Krzysztof Ho\u0142owczyc is third, 12 seconds behind Gordon and 7 minutes 48 secs behind the leader. Peterhansel is a Dakar legend with three car titles and six on motorbikes, all coming before the grueling endurance event moved to South America in 2009 but he didn\u2019t enjoy his best stage on Monday. He told the Dakar Rally\u2019s official website: \u201cI am losing loads of time. I drove quite slowly in the rocky parts because I was scared of punctures. And despite this\u2026 I had one 30 km from the finish. It was a bad special, but that is the way it is. \u201cGordon started three minutes before us, and 180 kilometres from here we had got to 30 seconds behind him. I think that when he saw us he stepped it up, leaving us in the dust.  \u201cHe can win this thing, so it is essential for him to manage this situation as well as he can.\u201d Defending motorcycle champion Marc Coma sealed the 20th stage win of his Dakar Rally career as rival Cyril Despres got stuck in the mud. Stage eight saw Coma, from Spain, snatch the lead from the Frenchman and build a lead of one minute and 26 seconds. Despres spent ten minutes trying to extricate himself from a patch of mud and cut a frustrated figure at the end of the stage. He said: \u201cThere was a torrent of mud between the inspection of the reconnaissance car two days ago and today. Therefore, it did not appear in the road book and I was the first to fall into the trap.  \u201cThere was no way I could have avoided it. I am awaiting the organisers\u2019 decision: after Ullevalseter, Gon\u00e7alves and a few others had gone through, they took a detour, otherwise there would have been 200 vehicles trapped in the mud.  \u201cSo I fail to see why I and the others should be the only ones to pay the price. But I do not think we will let this be.\u201d"

Fifth seed Stosur lost 6-2 6-4 to Italy\u2019s Francesca Schiavone, her second early exit in the past week after going out in the second round of the WTA Tour event in her home city of Brisbane. The 27-year-old has risen to sixth in the world rankings after capturing her first major title at the U.S. Open in September, and hopes are high that Stosur could become the first Australian woman to win the tennis season\u2019s opening grand slam since Chris O\u2019Neil in 1978. But her latest defeat means she will enter the Melbourne event next week having played just three competitive matches since January 1. \u201cI think the whole emotional side of things really took over today,\u201d Stosur told reporters. \u201cI never felt like I was able to be loose and free with the way I wanted to play. I certainly didn\u2019t handle the crowd and expectation side of things at all well. \u201cI think it\u2019s the whole expectation I put on myself, too. You do all the work leading up and feel okay and then today all of a sudden it\u2019s just like a bombshell hits you. That makes it harder to handle.\u201d Stosur will now concentrate on making sure she is prepared for a tournament where she has never got past the fourth round. \u201cSomething my coach just tried to drum into my head is that I\u2019ve had two pretty disappointing tournaments, but I\u2019ve also had that in previous years and then got to Melbourne and played better and handled it better,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a week to go, and hopefully that\u2019s going to be the same this year.\u201d Monday\u2019s match was a repeat of the 2010 French Open final, which Stosur also lost, and world No. 11 Schiavone was pleased to go through to a second-round meeting with Slovakia\u2019s Daniela Hantuchova \u2013 who beat her compatriot Roberta Vinci. \u201cYou\u2019re never in control with Sam,\u201d the 31-year-old told the WTA\u2019s website. \u201cYou never know what she can do. She\u2019s strong and fast and puts a lot of pressure on you.  \u201cWhen she comes inside the court there\u2019s no way to defend \u2013 live or die. But I played aggressively and she couldn\u2019t play her best. It was closer than the score shows, though.\u201d Sixth seed Vera Zvonareva also crashed out early, losing 6-1 6-2 to fellow Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova. The five other top-10 players in action avoided defeat, with third seed Victoria Azarenka recording a 6-2 6-1 win over Switzerland\u2019s Stefanie Vogele. The 2011 French Open champion Li Na beat Russia\u2019s Ekaterina Makarova 6-0 6-3, while seventh seed Agnieszka Radwanska won 6-1 6-1 against her sister Urszula Radwanska. French eighth seed Marion Bartoli and Germany\u2019s Andrea Petkovic also won in straight sets, beating Slovenia\u2019s Polona Hercog and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia respectively. In the men\u2019s draw, Australian wildcard Matthew Ebden caused a shock by battling to a 6-1 3-6 6-3 triumph against Spanish seventh seed Marcel Granollers. Another unexpected victor was American Ryan Sweeting, who was only present in the draw due to sixth seed Florian Meyer\u2019s withdrawal with a hip injury. Sweeting capitalized on his last-minute opportunity by coming from behind to earn a 3-6 7-6 (7-2) 7-5 win against Luxembourg\u2019s Gilles Muller. In Tasmania, Australia\u2019s fifth-seeded defending champion Jarmila Gajdosova kept her focus to triumph 6-3 6-4 over Japan\u2019s Ayumi Morita in a rain-delayed contest at the Hobart International. The weather halted play before the all-Spanish clash between second seed Anabel Medina Garrigues and Carla Suarez Navarro could take place. Earlier, Belgian top seed Yanina Wickmayer beat New Zealand\u2019s Marina Erakovic, while German No. 4 Angelique Kerber defeated Russian Elena Vesnina."

City manager Mancini has officially appealed against Chris Foy\u2019s decision to dismiss Kompany in the 12th minute of the 3-2 home defeat that ended his side\u2019s English FA Cup title defense at the first hurdle, and blamed Rooney for influencing the referee. Kompany slid in with two feet to win the ball off United winger Nani, who did not appeal for a foul \u2013 but Rooney ran straight to the official and Foy ruled that it was a dangerous tackle. \u201cIt was not a red card.

The veteran American golfer struggled to make birdies at the start of the third round in Hawaii, carding a bogey at the par-three eighth hole before seeing his lead cut to a single shot through 14 at the PGA Tour\u2019s season-opening event. But Stricker, an 11-time winner on the tour, finished with four consecutive birdies to cap off a four-under-par 69 and move onto 19 under for the tournament. The 44-year-old led from compatriots Webb Simpson (69) and 2011 champion Jonathan Byrd (67), who were tied for second with Scotland\u2019s Martin Laird (67) on 14 under in the 27-man field. \u201cThat was key to finish that way,\u201d Stricker, who won twice last year, told the PGA Tour website. \u201cIt sets me up for some momentum going into tomorrow. \u201cI just kept telling myself that I had the lead still and just to be patient. Things were not really going the way I had hoped, but I just kept telling myself to hang in there.\u201d Stricker felt the pressure as his lead slipped away, admitting to feeling \u201cpretty stagnant out there\u201d and \u201cfrustrated\u201d after his drive missed the fairway at the par-four 12th. \u201cI wasn\u2019t making any birdies, and it seemed like everybody else was,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew it was going to be tough. When you\u2019re leading a golf tournament, it\u2019s just hard to keep that momentum.  \u201cI didn\u2019t feel comfortable. I didn\u2019t hit it bad, but I didn\u2019t feel as aggressive at times. You\u2019re in a position where you don\u2019t want to screw up, but yet you\u2019re on a course that birdies can be made and guys can come from a ways back.\u201d Despite Stricker\u2019s significant lead, Byrd was still hopeful of retaining his title, citing his six successive birdies during Friday\u2019s opening round as proof that anything can happen. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough guy to catch,\u201d the 33-year-old said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think any lead is too much. You never know when somebody is not going to have their best day.  \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t think I was going to make six birdies in a row when I started that stretch. That kind of stuff just happens.\u201d Laird enjoyed a fine start to his round on Sunday, carding four birdies on the front nine. But the 29-year-old said he will have to put in another strong performance on Monday to stand any chance of claiming the $1.12 million winner\u2019s check. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it will take, but I\u2019m guessing a minimum of eight under probably,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is a golf course where you can do it.\u201d American pair Kevin Na (71) and Bryce Molder (67) were tied for fifth on 11 under. Harrison Frazar was one shot further back, shooting a 66 to claim the best round of the day and move onto 10 under. Ben Crane (68), Chris Kirk (70) and D.A. Points (71) of the U.S. and South Africa\u2019s Rory Sabbatini (68) were on eight under. South Korean K.J. Choi is tied for 12th on seven under following a 69, with 2011 PGA Championship winner Keegan Bradley struggling after a 75 left him tied for 19th on three under."

        "content": "English football club Liverpool apologized Sunday after an opposing team\u2019s player complained of being abused by supporters. Oldham\u2019s on-loan defender Tom Adeyemi was visibly upset after an incident during Friday\u2019s FA Cup third-round tie at Liverpool\u2019s Anfield ground. A statement on the club\u2019s website read: \u201cWhatever the outcome of what is now a police investigation, all of us are deeply sorry for what happened on Friday night and players and our club pass on our sincere regrets to Tom Adeyemi for the upset and distress he suffered as a result of the matter at hand.\u201d Merseyside police arrested a 20-year-old man from Aintree on \u201csuspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offense\u201d and he was bailed Sunday. Liverpool striker Luis Suarez was last month banned for eight matches for racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra, and his club made a big show of publicly defending the Uruguay international before finally accepting the punishment earlier this week. Chelsea and England captain John Terry has been charged by police for allegedly racially abusing Queens Park Rangers player Anton Ferdinand, and will face a court case in February. Before the arrest on Saturday,  former Oldham player Reuben Hazell claimed on social networking website Twitter that it was a matter of racial abuse. \u201cAfter the game I went into the Oldham dressing room to catch up with my old mates and spoke to Tom Adeyemi directly about what the altercation with the fan was all about. He said he was racially abused by the fan. This is FACT,\u201d wrote Hazell, who now plays for Shrewsbury in the fourth division, one below that which Oldham competes in. Adeyemi, who has Nigerian ancestry, is on the books of his hometown team Norwich but the 20-year-old has yet to establish himself at the Premier League side. His loan at Oldham is due to expire this month, and he spent last season with fourth division Bradford. Oldham captain Dean Furman said Adeyemi\u2019s treatment during the 5-1 defeat at Liverpool was unacceptable. \u201cHe was abused and I\u2019ll leave it to Tom and the police to investigate that,\u201d Furman told BBC Radio Manchester. \u201cWhat happened should not happen in the game. It has been highlighted over the last few months and it is an absolute disgrace. \u201c In a separate development, a 21-year-old man was charged Saturday with racially abusing former Premier League star Stan Collymore on Twitter. Collymore, 40, played for a number of top clubs, including Liverpool and now works as a broadcaster and football pundit. He also campaigns publicly against racism. Northumbria Police said Joshua Cryer, of Jesmond, Newcastle, was charged with \u201ca Section Five racial public order offense and a Section Five public order offense.\u201d He was bailed to appear before magistrates on Monday January 23.

It left the reigning Spanish and European champions five points adrift of leaders Real Madrid, who thrashed Granada 5-1 on Saturday. The visitors took a 16th-minute lead through a header from Cesc Fabregas, who had an earlier effort ruled out for handball in the build-up by Lionel Messi. The former Arsenal midfielder also hit the woodwork before Argentina maestro Messi \u2013 one of three candidates for Monday\u2019s FIFA Ballon d\u2019Or awards announcement \u2013 clipped the outside of the post with a shot in the second half. Who are January\u2019s top transfer targets? But Barca\u2019s cross-city rivals stuck to their task and were rewarded when Alvaro Vazquez scored four minutes from time with a low header. Barca searched desperately for the winner and defender Gerard Pique hit the woodwork in injury-time from close range, and then an appeal for a penalty after an apparent handball by Espanyol\u2019s Raul Rodriguez \u2013 who blocked Pedro\u2019s follow-up shot \u2013 was turned down by the referee. \u201cIn football you must overcome these types of things. We have to be concerned with what we can control,\u201d Barca coach Pep Guardiola told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ve always done things this way and we will continue to do so. We cannot control the referees, rather we must focus on improving the things that we didn\u2019t do well. \u201cAfter the equalizing goal, we reacted correctly, but it was too late. I cannot be dissatisfied with this team, I could never be. There is still a lot of Liga still yet to be played and a lot of points up for grabs.\u201d In Sunday\u2019s other La Liga action, Aritz Aduriz grabbed an equalizer three minutes from time as third-placed Valencia recovered from two down to draw 2-2 against Villarreal at El Madrigal. With Jose Molina taking charge of lowly Villarreal for the first time, he saw his new team go two up in 18 minutes as Marco Ruben and Gonzalo struck. But Sofiane Feghouli pulled one back before half-time and Aduriz salvaged a point late on to leave his side four points behind Barca and four ahead of fourth-placed local rivals Levante, who also drew on Saturday. Sevilla missed the chance to claim fifth place, losing 2-1 at Rayo Vallecano \u2013 who moved up to 13th and left Villarreal into the bottom three. In Serie A, AC Milan, Juventus and Udinese all won on Sunday to pull away from the chasing pack in Italy. Milan won 2-0 at Atalanta to remain level on points with Juve, who beat  Lecce 1-0, but top on goal difference. Udinese are just two points back after they thumped 10-man Cesena 4-1. A Zlatan Ibrahimovic penalty in the first half and a late second from Kevin-Prince Boateng sealed the three points for leaders Milan. Bottom club Lecce might have held Juve, but goalkeeper Massimiliano Benassi could not field Mirko Vucinic\u2019s weak shot and Alessandro Matri ran in to head home the winner. Udinese maintained their challenge as Antonio Di Natale set them on the way with a first minute goal but Eder equalized for Cesena. Ghana international Kwadwo Asamoah restored Udinese\u2019s lead before Maurizio Lauro saw red for the home side. Dusan Basta and Di Natale with his second rounded off the scoring for the visitors. In the French Cup, Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s first match in charge of Paris Saint-Germain saw his side struggle to beat fifth flight Saint-Colomban Locmine 2-1. It needed an added time winner from Uruguay captain Diego Lugano to spare Ancelotti\u2019s blushes against the minnows. Javier Pastore gave the away side the lead after the break, but PSG were shocked when Abou Maiga leveled. Lugano\u2019s header spared PSG extra time as they progressed to the last 32."

        "content": "Paul Scholes came out of retirement for a shock return as Manchester United beat FA Cup holders Manchester City 3-2 in Sunday\u2019s dramatic third-round tie between England\u2019s top two teams. The 37-year-old former England international quit at the end of last season, but was named as a substitute by manager Alex Ferguson after agreeing to return for the rest of this season. He came off the bench just before the hour mark to be cheered by the visiting United fans at the Etihad Stadium, with the Premier League champions already 3-0 ahead. Scholes\u2019 return was not entirely successful as his mistake led to City\u2019s second goal, scored by Sergio Aguero, but United held on for a hard-fought victory. Who are January\u2019s top transfer targets? Premier League leaders City had captain Vincent Kompany sent off after 12 minutes and were 3-0 down at halftime before forging a comeback. The defender\u2019s red card could cost him a four-match ban, which would be a blow to City\u2019s hopes of a first league title since 1968 given that Yaya and Kolo Toure are away for a month at the African Cup of Nations. City manager Roberto Mancini said the club would appeal Kompany\u2019s second straight red this season, which came for a two-footed lunge on United winger Nani in the 12th minute at 1-0 down. \u201cWe will appeal. I am sure we will win,\u201d Mancini said. Wayne Rooney scored twice for United, either side of Kompany\u2019s controversial red card, as he returned to form following reports that the club wanted to sell him. He said Scholes\u2019 recall had been a big surprise. Blog: Who are the top 10 transfer targets ? \u201cIt was a bit of a shock to be honest, we didn\u2019t know until we were in the dressing room, but he\u2019s a great player,\u201d Rooney told ITV Sport. Ferguson opted for Scholes, who has been working with the reserves at United, with his squad hit by an injury crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic that Paul has made this decision,\u201d Ferguson said before the match started. \u201cHe has kept himself in great shape and I always felt that he had another season in him. It\u2019s terrific to have him back.\u201d Rooney\u2019s 10th-minute header put United ahead, then Kompany was dismissed by referee Chris Foy soon after.  Fellow striker Danny Welbeck made it 2-0 with a superb volley before earning the spot-kick to give Rooney the chance to score his second. Rooney saw his effort saved by City\u2019s stand-in keeper Costel Pantilmon \u2013 who replaced rested England No.1 Joe Hart \u2013 but then headed home the rebound. Aleksandar Kolarov gave Roberto Mancini\u2019s men an early second-half lifeline with a free-kick from the edge of the area before the entry of Scholes. His mistake let James Milner cross for Aguero\u2019s goal, but otherwise he gave an assured display in his return to the big time. United\u2019s reward for beating their local rivals is a mouthwatering fourth-round tie at Liverpool, who beat Oldham 5-1 Friday. Liverpool decide against appeal in Suarez race ban case It will be the first clash between the two sides since the October league clash which led to an eight-game ban for Luis Suarez for racially abusing United\u2019s Patrice Evra. Everton-Fulham is another confirmed all-Premier League tie, while Arsenal, if they beat Leeds on Monday, will be at home to Aston Villa. In Sunday\u2019s other third-round action Sunday, Ramires scored twice as Chelsea enjoyed a 4-0 victory over Portsmouth at Stamford Bridge. His late double and an added time fourth for Frank Lampard were hard on Pompey, who had restricted Chelsea to a goal by Juan Mata in the 48th minute. Chelsea will face the winners of the MK Dons-QPR replay, while Sunderland who won 2-0 at Peterborough Sunday to continue their remarkable revival under Martin O\u2019Neill, will play Middlesbrough in a north-east derby.

Claudio Ranieri\u2019s team closed to within a point of the Rome side after 17 games as Italy\u2019s Serie A program resumed following a winter break. The win left Inter five points behind defending champions AC Milan and second-placed Juventus, who travel to mid-table Atalanta and bottom side Lecce respectively on Sunday. Inter have been linked with a move for Carlos Tevez, who is widely expected to join local rivals Milan, but it was the Manchester City striker\u2019s fellow Argentine Diego Milito who hit the headlines with a first-half double at the San Siro. Who will be January\u2019s top transfer targets? Milito has failed to maintain the heights that saw him score both goals in the final of Europe\u2019s premier club competition in 2010, but the 32-year-old highlighted his value with a 13th-minute opener from compatriot Ricardo Alvarez\u2019s cross. Midfielder Thiago Motta made it 2-0 with a low shot from distance five minutes later, and Milito headed his seventh goal in all competitions this season from Maicon\u2019s cross just before halftime. Milito set up strike partner Giampaolo Pazzini in the 56th minute, and the South American\u2019s 76th-minute replacement Marcoo Faraoni sealed Inter\u2019s biggest win this season with his first touch of the ball, as the 20-year-old fired in a volley off the crossbar for his first goal in Serie A. It is the first time Inter have won five league matches in a row since Jose Mourinho departed in May 2010, and continues the club\u2019s resurgent form after a poor start to this season. The defeat left Parma in 13th, and followed 4-1 defeats by Juve and Milan earlier this season. Title hopefuls Lazio could have moved up to third place above Udinese, but went 3-0 down by halftime against Siena after goalkeeper Albano Bizzarri was sent off. Young striker Mattia Destro gave the Tuscany side the lead after only 11 minutes, and Emanuele Calaio doubled the lead on 35 with his first penalty after Franco Brienza went down in the box. Destro put the ball in the net just before the break, but the referee had already awarded a penalty after Bizzarri made contact with the 20-year-old \u2013 and substitute keeper Juan Pablo Carrizo\u2019s first job was to retrieve Calaio\u2019s spot-kick from the back of the net. Destro, on loan from Genoa, sealed victory with nine minutes to play, heading in Cristiano Del Grosso\u2019s cross for his fifth Serie A goal this season as Siena moved up to 14th \u2013 six points above the bottom three."

But his surging form in the Hummer, passing five drivers in the second half of the 419-kilometer special in and around Copiapo, has given him hope that all is not over going into Sunday\u2019s halfway rest day. \u201cThe car worked perfectly well today and we attacked from the beginning to the end of the special. We took a lot of risks to set the best time,\u201d the 41-year-old said, having lost a stage when Friday\u2019s leg from Fiambala in Argentina was called off due to snow in the Andes.  \u201cOur objective is to claw back seven or eight minutes every day. And today we did it perfectly. We will do our best to repeat this performance in all stages from Monday onwards, or even try to do better.\u201d Peterhansel is a Dakar legend with three car titles and six on motorbikes, all coming before the grueling endurance event moved to South America in 2009 due to security problems in Africa.

Motorbike champion Marc Coma moved to within eight minutes of leader Cyril Despres after shaving 2:03 off the Frenchman\u2019s advantage on Saturday. The Spaniard triumphed in the sand dunes to keep alive his hopes of a fourth title for the KLM team. \u201cIt is common knowledge that the stage before the rest day is always difficult, and today was not an exception, with stifling heat and very soft sand,\u201d Coma said.  \u201cNevertheless, we rode very fast and I was able to attack. We know the strategy well, so we are aware that I will probably gain two minutes one day, then Cyril will gain two minutes the next\u2026 And it is hard to change this when there is but one road.\u201d Despres, also a three-time winner on bikes, admitted he had lapsed in concentration. \u201cI was a bit lazy today, since Marc led the race from km 200 onwards, the start of the second special, but I think that is also part of the race. So I thank him for this,\u201d he said.  \u201cThere is always a strategic aspect, since we know we can control two-minute gaps. Having said that, I finished with my hands paralyzed, but it was a really beautiful special with beautiful dunes.\u201d"

Nick Booth, chief executive of the Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry, said the foundation is \u201cincredibly excited\u201d about the prospect of helping veterans through the partnership. Their efforts will be backed up by 35 million pounds ($54 million) in funding from the British National Lottery fund. The red-carpet premiere of \u201cWar Horse,\u201d based on a novel by Michael Morpurgo which has also won acclaim as a long-running stage show, comes a day before the duchess turns 30. A senior palace aide told CNN that the duchess, who is six months older than her husband, will be celebrating her birthday privately and in a low-key fashion. Catherine took steps to carve out a greater public role for herself this week, announcing the causes she would support as patron. They included the National Portrait Gallery and an art therapy charity, as well as East Anglia\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospices and an organization that helps those struggling with addiction. She will also volunteer with young members of the Scout Association, particularly groups that meet near the home she shares with William in north Wales."

Murray, watched by his new mentor, cruised to a 6-1 6-3 victory to open the ATP Tour season with his 22nd title. It was an impressive display from the World No. 4, who will be hoping Lendl\u2019s influence can guide him to his first grand slam title at the Australian Open later this month. Top seed Murray was always in command and broke twice in the 26-minute first set, coming from 2-1 down to lead 4-0 in the second with a run of nine straight games. Dolgopolov, who was troubled with a groin injury, broke back to briefly worry the Scot, but Murray closed out the final in just 67 minutes. \u201cI served pretty well again,\u201d he told the official ATP Tour website. \u201cIt got close in the second set and I stayed focused. He was just going for his shots and hit quite a few winners but I didn\u2019t let it get to me. \u201cI felt like I was moving well right at the end of the week.\u201d He will now play the Kooyong exhibition event to tune up for the Australian Open where he has been losing finalist for the past two years. In the other ATP Tour final Sunday, big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic won the  Chennai Open title with a three sets win over Janko Tipsarevic. All three went to tiebreaks before 21-year-old Raonic won 6-7 7-6 7-6 in over three hours on court. On the WTA Tour, China\u2019s Zheng Jie won the ASB Classic in Auckland when her opponent Flavia Panetta of Italy retired injured when trailing 2-0 in the deciding set. "

        "content": "Real Madrid piled the pressure on Barcelona by moving six points clear at the top of Spain\u2019s La Liga with a 5-1 thrashing of Granada on Saturday. Barcelona, seeking a fourth successive league title, now cannot afford to slip up in Sunday\u2019s trip to city rivals Espanyol. Jose Mourinho\u2019s Real made the perfect start after the Spanish winter break as Karim Benzema netted twice and Cristiano Ronaldo extended his leading goal tally to 21. It was Real\u2019s 14th win in 17 league games for a total of 43 points from a possible 51, with 61 goals for and 16 against. Benzema opened the scoring after 20 minutes after Ronaldo and Mesut Ozil combined well inside the box, but 14th-placed Granada surprisingly leveled soon after as Mikel Rico headed in a cross by Nigeria forward Ikechukwu Uche. Who will be January\u2019s top transfer targets? Spain defender Sergio Ramos restored the home side\u2019s advantage as he powerfully nodded in Ozul\u2019s 34th-minute corner, and Argentina forward Gonzalo Higuain made it 3-1 straight after the break with his 13th league goal this season after fullback Marcelo was allowed to surge into the box. Benzema made it safe in the 50th minute as the France forward controlled Xabi Alonso\u2019s lofted diagonal pass and fired in a low shot for his 10th in La Liga and 16th overall. Ronaldo finally got on the scoresheet with a minute of regulation time remaining, as the world\u2019s most expensive player \u2013 who is on the shortlist for the FIFA Ballon d\u2019Or award to be named on Monday \u2013 fired in from the edge of the penalty area. That took the Portugal captain four goals clear of Barca\u2019s Lionel Messi, who is hoping to win his third successive world player of the year title. Fourth-placed Levante face the prospect of losing ground on Valencia after being held to a 0-0 draw by visiting Real Mallorca. Valencia, who trail Barca by four points, can move six clear of their local rivals by winning at third-bottom Villarreal on Sunday. Levante did, however, stay four points clear of fifth-placed Osasuna, who also played out a stalemate at Real Sociedad as both those sides extended their unbeaten runs to six matches. Sevilla can leapfrog the Pamplona-based side with victory at Rayo Vallecano on Sunday. Malaga also had the chance to claim fifth by beating Atletico Madrid in Saturday\u2019s late match, but there were no goals in that game either and the home side had to settle for going a point above Sevilla into sixth. Racing Santander moved above second-bottom Sporting Gijon, Villarreal and Vallecano with a 1-0 victory at home to Real Zaragoza that lifted the Cantabrians out of the relegation zone. Bernardo Espinosa\u2019s winner in first-half injury time left Zaragoza five points adrift at the bottom of the table.    "

The Wimbledon champion ended the week undefeated after her 7-5 6-1 win over ninth-ranked Marion Bartoli in Perth, Australia. The 21-year-old, who won the season-ending WTA Championships in October, also saw off the challenge of world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki on Friday and did not drop a set against American Bethanie Mattek-Sands or Bulgaria\u2019s Tsvetana Pironkova. Seventh-ranked Tomas Berdych gave the Czechs an unbeatable lead when he triumphed 7-6 (7-0) 6-4 against Richard Gasquet to also be undefeated in the men\u2019s singles and leave the French still seeking a first title. \u201cIt was a really good match (against Wozniacki) but today I played much better against Marion and it\u2019s always tough to play with someone at the top,\u201d Kvitova said. \u201cIt\u2019s really good to win at the beginning of the season, and of course I have to say thank you to Tomas because without him we wouldn\u2019t win.\u201d It was a good day for Czech tennis players, as Andrea Hlavackova and Lucie Hradecka won the first doubles title of the WTA Tour season at the ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand.

The 26-year-old, ranked 34th, followed up her earlier victories over Italian third seed Francesca Schiavone and German No. 2 Andrea Petkovic. She had never beaten 24th-ranked Hantuchova in three previous meetings, and her opponent fell to her ninth defeat in 13 career finals. \u201cIn previous years I\u2019ve been a surprise player \u2013 I was able to beat higher-ranked players, but then maybe lose to lower-ranked players,\u201d Kanepi said.  \u201cNow I\u2019m playing more stable, not making as many errors. I\u2019m beating top players more consistently. Hopefully I can get that ranking myself one day.\u201d "

The match was delayed by misty conditions, and world No. 6 Tsonga suffered one worrying slip on the greasy hard-court surface before completing a 7-5 6-3 victory in Doha. The 26-year-old claimed the first title of the 2012 ATP Tour season and the eighth of his career, showing the sort of form that took him to the final of the year\u2019s opening grand slam in Melbourne four years ago. He became the third Frenchman to win the event, being played in the Gulf state for the 20th time, and extended his career record over his Davis Cup teammate to 3-1.

The surface was very slippery especially on the \u2018Qatar\u2019  sign painted on the court,\u201d Tsonga, who won 16 of the last 19 points, told reporters. \u201cIt was dangerous but they did enough to make it okay.

The 37-year-old goes into the final round tied for the lead with 2010 British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen and one shot ahead of two-time U.S. Open winner Retief Goosen after carding a superb eight-under-par 65 in East London on Saturday. Van der Walt, who finished second in a 2005 U.S. PGA Tour event, eliminated Oosthuizen\u2019s two-shot overnight lead as he started with four successive birdies and \u2013 like his fellow South African \u2013 picked up a shot at the final hole. The world No. 347\u2019s only blemish at his home event came at the par-four eighth hole, and he was confident he could contend for his first title since turning pro in 1996 in the opening event of the 2012 European Tour season. \u201cAt the end of the day, the golf ball doesn\u2019t know that they are major champions,\u201d he said of his rivals. \u201cI\u2019ve played at the highest level, I\u2019ve never won majors or big events, so who knows what can happen. \u201cI do feel as if I am controlling the golf ball as well as I have in a long time. Not just tee to green, but on the greens as well. And that\u2019s a good sign for me. I\u2019m entitled to forget the one bad shot I hit all day.\u201d Defending champion Oosthuizen\u2019s only lapse came at the par-five 11th hole as he took four shots to reach the green. \u201cIt was an elementary mistake really. Those little chip-outs seem easy, and I made the basic error of leaving it short of a tree for my approach to the green,\u201d the world No. 40 said. Goosen, seeking his first European Tour win for five years, carded a flawless 66 to be on 20-under 199.  The 42-year-old, who topped the tour\u2019s Order of Merit money list in 2001 and 2002, was one shot clear of fourth-placed Englishman Danny Willett, who shot 65. Another South African, Richard Sterne, was also in contention after firing seven birdies and an eagle in his 64 to claim fifth place on 202. The 30-year-old, a five-time winner on the tour, is making his first outing in almost a year following back problems. Meanwhile, defending champion Jonathan Byrd claimed a one-shot lead after Friday\u2019s first round of the PGA Tour\u2019s season-opening Tournament of Champions in Hawaii. The 33-year-old, whose only title last year came in Kapalua, carded six-under 67 on the Plantation Course to lead the 28-man field. Fellow American Webb Simpson, who was runner-up in the 2011 FedEx Cup series and the tour\u2019s money list, was equal second with compatriots Steve Stricker and Michael Bradley plus Scotland\u2019s Martin Laird. PGA Championship winner Keegan Bradley was sixth after a 69, while veteran Korean K.J. Choi carded 70. Lucas Glover, who beat Byrd in a playoff at the Wells Fargo Championship last season, withdrew before his tee-off due to a knee injury suffered while paddleboarding last weekend."

        "content": "English football club Liverpool apologized Sunday after an opposing team\u2019s player complained of being abused by supporters. Oldham\u2019s on-loan defender Tom Adeyemi was visibly upset after an incident during Friday\u2019s FA Cup third-round tie at Liverpool\u2019s Anfield ground. A statement on the club\u2019s website read: \u201cWhatever the outcome of what is now a police investigation, all of us are deeply sorry for what happened on Friday night and players and our club pass on our sincere regrets to Tom Adeyemi for the upset and distress he suffered as a result of the matter at hand.\u201d Merseyside police arrested a 20-year-old man from Aintree on \u201csuspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offense\u201d and he was bailed Sunday. Liverpool striker Luis Suarez was last month banned for eight matches for racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra, and his club made a big show of publicly defending the Uruguay international before finally accepting the punishment earlier this week. Chelsea and England captain John Terry has been charged by police for allegedly racially abusing Queens Park Rangers player Anton Ferdinand, and will face a court case in February. Before the arrest on Saturday,  former Oldham player Reuben Hazell claimed on social networking website Twitter that it was a matter of racial abuse. \u201cAfter the game I went into the Oldham dressing room to catch up with my old mates and spoke to Tom Adeyemi directly about what the altercation with the fan was all about. He said he was racially abused by the fan. This is FACT,\u201d wrote Hazell, who now plays for Shrewsbury in the fourth division, one below that which Oldham competes in. Adeyemi, who has Nigerian ancestry, is on the books of his hometown team Norwich but the 20-year-old has yet to establish himself at the Premier League side. His loan at Oldham is due to expire this month, and he spent last season with fourth division Bradford. Oldham captain Dean Furman said Adeyemi\u2019s treatment during the 5-1 defeat at Liverpool was unacceptable. \u201cHe was abused and I\u2019ll leave it to Tom and the police to investigate that,\u201d Furman told BBC Radio Manchester. \u201cWhat happened should not happen in the game. It has been highlighted over the last few months and it is an absolute disgrace. \u201c In a separate development, a 21-year-old man was charged Saturday with racially abusing former Premier League star Stan Collymore on Twitter. Collymore, 40, played for a number of top clubs, including Liverpool and now works as a broadcaster and football pundit. He also campaigns publicly against racism. Northumbria Police said Joshua Cryer, of Jesmond, Newcastle, was charged with \u201ca Section Five racial public order offense and a Section Five public order offense.\u201d He was bailed to appear before magistrates on Monday January 23.

        "content": "When Rowena Macintosh was deciding on whether or not to get breast implants, she told the operating surgeon that she was concerned about leaking silicone from the implants.   So he placed in front of her an implant and sliced it open to show her how the silicone remained solid inside, assuring her it would not spill out into her body.  She said it looked like jelly candy. \u201cWhen I was told that there was absolutely no chance of this breast implant leaking because of this \u2018jelly baby effect\u2019, if you like.  Well, that was about 50% of the decision because it felt safe and it was guaranteed for 25 years,\u201d Macintosh told CNN at her home in Bournemouth. \u201cI didn\u2019t think to check the manufacturer \u2026 because it\u2019s not something you do.  You go to someone who\u2019s supposed to be medically qualified and you trust them,\u201d she said.  \u201cWhen you go to a doctor, you don\u2019t say:  Who makes your medicine?  You just assume they\u2019re going to be safe.\u201d The manufacturer was PIP \u2013 the bankrupt French company that appears to have used industrial grade silicone intending for stuffing mattresses inside breast implants.  Now, there are concerns that PIP implants are also more prone to leaking and rupturing. French authorities announced last month that the government would pay for the removal of the bankrupt company\u2019s implants. Authorities in France and England have dismissed fears of cancer from the implants, but have said the devices are prone to rupture and could cause inflammation, scarring and fibrosis. More than 500 French women have had the implants removed since last year, according to the French government agency that evaluates the safety of medical products. Since then, more than 1,000 implants have ruptured, the agency said. Germany, UK weigh in on breast implant concerns Months after her surgery, Macintosh says she began to get burning and stabbing pains in the area.  More recently, she has found a hard mass in one breast.  She fears that her PIP implants have leaked and she wants them removed and replaced immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s like a ticking time bomb inside me.  Until someone says you can have them taken out and put back in again, I\u2019m going to be worried,\u201d Macintosh says.   The problem:  Who will pay for the operation?  Britain\u2019s National Health Service does not pay for cosmetic surgery, so an estimated 95% of breast implant operations are done in private clinics.    But now that women are demanding PIP implants be removed, some clinics are refusing to treat them.   Rowena Macintosh says she saved up and paid almost $8000 for her breast implants, including surgery and after care.  But the clinic refused to giver her a scan to detect ruptures, she says, and also declined to consider removing and replacing the implants until there was a proven problem.   The clinic refused to comment to CNN citing privacy concerns. \u201cI think ultimately it\u2019s the surgeons and the clinics, whoever bought the implants and certified their use, that should be held responsible,\u201d she says.    The British government agrees, but says there is still no statistical data to show that PIP implants are either toxic or more prone to rupturing. \u201cOur advice remains the same that there is not sufficient evidence to recommend routine removal.  We have always recommended that women who are concerned should speak to their surgeon or GP,\u201d British Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in a statement. \u201cThe NHS will support removal of PIP implants if, after this consultation, the patient still has concerns and with her doctor she decides that it is right to do so. \u201cWe believe that private healthcare providers have a moral duty to offer the same service to their patients that we will offer to NHS patients \u2013 free information, consultations, scans and removal if necessary,\u201d Lansley said. But if clinics do not follow through, he added, the National Health Service will be called upon to step in and support patients.  Ultimately, taxpayers may have to foot the bill in some cases. That\u2019s not what Rowena Macintosh wants.  She wants the private clinic and surgeon to pay to remove and replace the PIP implants as soon as possible, but she realizes that may not happen until after a long legal battle. She doesn\u2019t regret the decision to get implants, she says, but she does wish she had chosen a different, more discerning clinic.  \u201cAnd to think I\u2019ve got mattress silicone inside me and God knows what else they used,\u201d she grimaces over a cup of tea in her kitchen.  \u201cIt\u2019s just disgusting, really.\u201d "

In the later action on court, a single break of service saw fourth seed Monfils take the opening set. Nadal hit back to lead 4-1 in the second set before Monfils conjured up five games in a row to compete a stunning victory in one hour 36 minutes.  Tsonga holds a 2-1 career winning record over Monfils, but he lost their last encounter in Montpellier in 2010. Earlier, Andy Murray raced into the semifinals of the Brisbane International with a straight sets win over Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus. World No. 4 Murray beat Baghdatis 6-2 6-2 and will play 19-year-old Australian hopeful Bernard Tomic in the last four in   Queensland. Tomic beat Uzbekistan\u2019s  Denis Istomin 6-3 7-6 in their quarterfinal match. "

        "content": "Four-time grand slam champion Kim Clijsters withdrew from her Brisbane International semifinal with a hip injury on Friday, casting doubt over the defense of her Australian Open crown later this month. The former world No. 1 lost the first set to Daniela Hantuchova and was 2-1 and a break down in the second against the Slovakian when she left the court for medical treatment. The Belgian returned and lost a further game before signaling to the umpire to end the match.  Clijsters admitted to feeling stiff prior to the contest and chose to retire rather than risk causing an injury which could keep her out of the Melbourne grand slam, which begins on January 16. It was her first top-level tournament since August, when a stomach injury forced her to miss the rest of last season. Clijsters was also sidelined for significant periods earlier in 2011 by ankle and shoulder problems. Clijsters powers into Brisbane semis \u201cI just felt my left hip getting tighter and tighter to the point where I felt like I couldn\u2019t go forward with my upper body or put any pressure on when I was landing on my serve,\u201d the 28-year-old told the tournament\u2019s official website. \u201cSo it was the smartest choice to try and not let it get any worse, to be ready for Melbourne in a couple of weeks. When you feel it getting worse and worse, you almost don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d It was the second time in as many matches that Hantuchova has benefited from an injury to her opponent.  The 28-year-old received a walkover in the quarterfinals when 13-time grand slam winner Serena Williams withdrew with an ankle problem which could force her out of the tennis season\u2019s first major. Hantuchova will face Kaia Kanepi in Saturday\u2019s final after the Estonian beat Italy\u2019s 2010 French Open champion Francesca Schiavone 6-3 6-0. Kanepi kept alive her hopes of a second WTA Tour title with a comprehensive win over third seed Schiavone, wrapping up victory in just 55 minutes. Meanwhile, Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova sent a warning to world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki by winning their singles clash in the Hopman Cup teams event in Perth. The second-ranked Kvitova and men\u2019s No. 7 Tomas Berdych booked the Czech Republic\u2019s place in Saturday\u2019s final against France with victories against Denmark\u2019s Wozniacki and Frederik Nielsen. Kvitova earned a hard-fought 7-6 3-6 6-4 triumph, while Berdych cruised to a 6-1 6-3 success. The Bulgarian pair of Grigor Dimitrov and Tsvetana Pironkova finished second in Group A above Denmark after a 2-1 win over the U.S.  Bethanie Mattek-Sands, who helped John Isner win the title last year, gave the Americans the lead by beating Tsvetana Pironkova 6-4 6-4. But world No. 76 Grigor Dimitrov upset eighth-ranked Mardy Fish 6-2 6-1 and then the Europeans won the doubles 8-5 to leave the U.S. bottom of the table. Richard Gasquet and Marion Bartoli qualified for the final by beating Spain on Thursday for a third successive win in Group B, and will seek to earn France\u2019s first title. China\u2019s Zheng Jie and Flavia Pennetta of Italy will contest the final of the WTA Tour\u2019s ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand. Jie battled back from a set down in her semifinal against Russian third seed and two-time grand slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova to win 2-6 6-3 6-3. Pennetta was a runner-up at the event in 2010 and will once again compete in the final following a 6-1 6-2 defeat of Germany\u2019s Angelique Kerber."

        "content": "Turkey\u2019s former military chief was behind bars Friday pending trial for his alleged role in a plot to overthrow the government. Gen. Ilker Basbug is the highest-ranking officer to be accused in a long-running tussle between the Islamic-backed government and Turkey\u2019s secular establishment, defended by the military. Basbug was arrested and taken to Silivri prison after testifying for seven hours Thursday in an Istanbul court, Basbug\u2019s lawyer Ilkay Sezer told reporters.  He stands accused of involvement with the so-called Ergenekon network, a nationalist group that prosecutors say created dozens of websites disseminating propaganda aimed at bringing down the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. \u201cThe 26th chief of general staff of the Turkish Republic is unfortunately arrested based on charges related to eliminating the government of Turkish Republic and establishing and leading a terrorist organization,\u201d Sezer said. Basbug retired as commander of the Turkish armed forces in 2010. He is the latest in a long line of military staff who stands accused of plotting against the government. A probe was launched in 2007, after the discovery of a stash of grenades and bomb-making materials in Istanbul. It led to waves of arrests and several court cases involving both civilians and former and active-duty officers. More than 300 people have been arrested in connection with Ergenekon. Among them are 97 journalists, according to the Turkish Press Union. The government\u2019s crackdown has polarized Turkish society, which has seen the military overthrow four governments in the past 50 years. Some view the government\u2019s actions in curbing military power as important steps to democratization in Turkey, a candidate for European Union membership. But critics say the investigation is a political witch hunt. They accuse Erdogan, an observant Muslim, of silencing his opponents and emasculating the secular establishment, including the military. Last July, Turkey\u2019s top four military officers resigned after a squabble with the government over the fate of officers jailed in the alleged plot against the Justice and Development Party. Friday, Turkish President Abdullah Gul told journalists that Basbug\u2019s arrest did not prove guilt. \u201cNo one can be declared guilty before a decision of the court,\u201d Gul said. \u201cEveryone is equal in the court of law. This is a legal process.\u201d"

        "content": "Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini wants to add to his squad during European football\u2019s January transfer window, but the Italian has revealed the English Premier League leaders must sell before they can recruit new players. City could lose brothers Yaya and Kolo Toure for over a month when they fly out to join the Ivory Coast squad for the African Cup of Nations this weekend, and Mancini hopes to draft in cover for the key midfielder and his defensive sibling. Despite being widely considered the richest football club in the world, the 2011 FA Cup winners must offload wantaway high-earners such as striker Carlos Tevez before being able to spend on new signings. \u201cI said two months ago that we could have a big problem in January because we have to play big games without Yaya,\u201d Mancini told reporters. Who are football\u2019s top January transfer targets? City have signed a host of big-name players since being taken over by Qatar\u2019s Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan in 2008. In the pre-season transfer window, City spent approximately $127 million on star names such as striker Sergio Aguero, playmaker Samir Nasri and fullback Gael Clichy. But financial fair play regulations introduced by European football\u2019s governing body UEFA mean City must slash the club\u2019s wage bill, having announced losses of $307.8 million in November \u2013 the highest ever recorded in English football. The new rules are designed to stop European football clubs spending beyond their means, with sanctions imposed on clubs who break them. Mancini suggested the absence of the Toures, combined with injuries to Italy striker Mario Balotelli and midfielder Owen Hargreaves and a suspension for England\u2019s Gareth Barry, could mean City cannot fill the seven-man substitutes\u2019 bench for Sunday\u2019s FA Cup third-round clash with archrivals Manchester United. \u201cIt\u2019s better that we sell first. Maybe then we can then take in other players \u2026 If we have strikers injured then we need to buy another at the moment I have one striker and two midfielders,\u201d the former Inter Milan coach said. In addition to this weekend\u2019s Manchester derby, the Toures could miss up to five league games as well as the two-legged English League Cup semifinal against Liverpool. Mancini has warned that a lack of strengthening in January could have a negative impact on the club\u2019s ambitions, with City three points ahead of neighbors United and seeking to win a first English title in 43 years. \u201cThis could be the first championship for many years and we need to do everything we can to win it,\u201d the 47-year-old said. \u201cUnited and Chelsea have won trophies for many years. So they are quiet. They understand that they can play without pressure. For us it\u2019s different.\u201d Sunday\u2019s match at the Etihad Stadium is a repeat of the 2011 FA Cup semifinal, which City won 1-0 through a goal from Yaya Toure en route to the club\u2019s first trophy in 35 years."

It was just one shot outside Richard Sterne\u2019s course record and left the 2010 British Open winner on 15-under 131 \u2013 two clear of a four-strong chasing pack. With compatriots Jaco Ahlers, Thomas Aiken, Retief Goosen and Tjaart Van der Walt on 13-under 133, it saw an all-South African top five at the European Tour event. The 29-year-old Oosthuizen, who started on the 10th, completed his front nine in four-under 32. But he reserved his best golf for the front nine, finishing with an eagle and three birdies in his final five holes to come home in just 30. \u201cI was aggressive on the putter. I went about six foot past a few times and I had to make those for par,\u201d  Oosthuizen told official European Tour website.  \u201cThe last one I made on the eighth would have been eight or ten foot past, but it hit the middle of the cup. \u201cBut I was aggressive because yesterday I left a few putts short and you\u2019re not going to hit it that far past on these greens.\u201d Van der Walt\u2019s 64 included successive eagles \u2013 a hole-in-one at the second followed by a 20-footer for a three at the par five third. Overnight leader Aiken had to settle for a 69, while Goosen had a 68 as he seeks his first European Tour win in five years. Ahlers recorded the same score.

The body was found Sunday by a member of the public walking a dog near the village of Anmer, which lies within the bounds of the 20,000-acre Sandringham estate in the English county of Norfolk. A post mortem examination revealed the remains are those of a white woman aged 15 to 23, between 5 feet 4 inches and 5 feet 6 inches tall, with high cheekbones, Norfolk Police said. But tests have so far failed to yield a DNA profile that might lead to her identity. Further tests on bone material are being carried out as part of the murder investigation. Police say it is \u201chighly unlikely\u201d the woman\u2019s death was through natural causes, but there is no evidence of injury through firearms, a knife or other trauma such as broken bones. The remains are thought to have been at the site for between one and four months.  A specialist from the Natural History Museum will carry out more tests Friday to try to refine the estimate by studying insect life. Speaking to reporters, Detective Chief Inspector Jes Fry said police were looking at people who might have been working or held events in the area, near the town of King\u2019s Lynn, in August or September last year. \u201cWe would be interested to hear from anyone who held or was involved in organizing any kind of function at Sandringham or neighboring parishes,\u201d he added. But Fry urged the media not to speculate about the woman\u2019s identity to avoid causing distress to the families of missing people. Sandringham House, at the heart of the rural estate, is where the royal family traditionally gathers to celebrate Christmas. It\u2019s been the private home of four generations of British monarchs since 1862, and is one of two private residences used by the queen. Part of the estate is a 600-acre country park open to the public.  A Buckingham Palace spokesman told CNN Tuesday Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip \u201care in residence at Sandringham from mid-December to the end of January\u201d but could not confirm whether or not they had been informed of the murder investigation. Prince Philip has been recuperating at Sandringham since he was released from the hospital December 27 after having a coronary stent implanted. Sandringham House and its gardens are open to the public from April to November."

The former France international signed his long-awaited two-month loan deal with the London side on Friday, but plans to be back for the start of the Major League Soccer season in March. \u201cI always said I would not play in Europe again, but it is hard for me when it comes to Arsenal,\u201d the 34-year-old the Gunners\u2019 website.  \u201cI am not coming here for the whole season, I will be back and I want to win the MLS Cup with the Red Bulls. I hope it is win-win situation where I can help Arsenal and come back fit for the MLS season.\u201d Who are January\u2019s top transfer targets? Henry returns to a club where he scored a record 226 goals before joining Spain\u2019s Barcelona in mid-2007, then moving to the Big Apple in 2010. A statue of the player has been erected at the Emirates Stadium to mark Arsenal\u2019s 125th anniversary. \u201cIt is unreal, to be honest. But when it comes to Arsenal my heart will always do the talking. Once I knew the plan behind it I was OK with it,\u201d he said.  Henry was brought in by manager Arsene Wenger with strikers Gervinho and Marouane Chamakh going to the African Cup of Nations this month, but recognizes that he will be providing backup for a player who has this season taken his mantle as the team\u2019s most influential player and captain \u2013 top scorer Robin van Persie. \u201cI am not coming here to be a hero or prove anything. I am just coming here to help.

        "content": "It sits in the ancient heart of Rome and is an emblem of the city\u2019s imperial history as well as an icon of Italy.  But plans to restore Rome\u2019s nearly 2,000-year-old Colosseum are causing rumblings among heritage workers and restorers, compounded by reports in December that small amounts of powdery rock had fallen off the monument.   The current $33 million (25 million euro) restoration plans to restore the Flavian amphitheater, which once hosted spectacular shows and gruesome gladiatorial battles, are being sponsored by Diego della Valle, of luxury Italian brand Tod\u2019s, in exchange for advertising rights.  Restoration of the monument, which attracts up to two million visitors a year, is due to go ahead in March and will involve cleaning of the travertine exterior, the restoration of underground chambers, new gating, the moving of visitor service stations to an area outside of the building itself and increased video security. But members of the Restorers Association of Italy are unhappy about the plans, which they believe has sidelined them in favor of non-specialist restorers and which \u201crun the risk of causing irreparable damage to the monument,\u201d according to the group\u2019s President, Carla Tomasi.  \u201cHaving some of the best restorers in the world in Italy and yet turning to general enterprises is a choice that we do not share, and embarrasses both our work and the image of our nation in the world, in addition to causing risks to the monument,\u201d Tomasi said.   A ruling given late December 2011 by Italy\u2019s Council of State in favor of the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities is however allowing the restoration plans to go ahead.  \u201cItalian law states that restorers can restore things like statues, ceramics, mosaics and decorative surfaces but not architecture,\u201d said Rossella Rea, Director of the Colosseum, adding that the workers employed to do the restorations are in fact \u201cspecialized in architectural restoration, they\u2019re not just ordinary workmen.\u201d Rea was also quick to stress that the reports of the Colosseum crumbling were false and that only 8cm of tuff \u2013 a porous rock formed by consolidation of volcanic ash \u2013 had come off, something \u201cthat happens all the time to monuments.\u201d But she also added that the Colosseum has suffered in recent years from underfunding caused by government cuts and that the revenue from ticket sales only covers the yearly upkeep of the city\u2019s ancient sites, which include the nearby Forum and Palatine.   Sponsorship, though difficult to obtain owing to sponsors having to pay VAT on donations, is much-needed.   Sneska Quaedvlieg-Mihailovic is Secretary General of Europa Nostra, an organization dedicated to protecting cultural heritage in Europe.  She said, \u201cWe at Europa Nostra and anyone dealing with heritage would say that it\u2019s wonderful to have private companies and individuals wanting to support heritage at a time when public budgets are being cut.\u201d But she also warned against governments across Europe loosening restrictions on restoration work in the current economic climate, and of privately funded restoration plans not complying with strict guidelines.   And while the current Colosseum project aims to improve visitor services in addition to cleaning and restoring the amphitheater, Quaedvlieg-Mihailovic believes that its underlying problems also need to be addressed \u2013 the main one being the car traffic that surrounds the site and causes the exterior to be tarnished with pollution. \u201cYou can do wonderful restoration works but you haven\u2019t yet tackled the things that will continue to cause damage and this is an issue at the level of the urban management of the city,\u201d she said.  \u201cIt\u2019s a problem that\u2019s been discussed with the City of Rome for many years,\u201d said Rea, adding that she hopes that with the building of a new subway stop near the Colosseum, the roads around the site will be closed to cars \u2013 though heritage workers have long complained that vibrations from the nearby subway trains are also damaging the building.  It\u2019s an ongoing struggle, Rea said, but one she hopes will eventually be successful.  After all, it\u2019s only been 60 years since people parked their cars inside the amphitheater. "

On the day that Suarez issued a brief apology over the incident, Piara Powar, executive director of European football\u2019s anti-discrimination body FARE, spoke of his disappointment at Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish\u2019s attitude to the suspension. \u201cKenny Dalglish\u2019s comments over the affair have been undignified and their reaction has damaged the club\u2019s brand across the world,\u201d Powar told the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association\u2019s official website. Suarez gave \u2018unreliable\u2019 evidence \u201cThis is a lack of respect for the governing body by Liverpool and the FA should charge them and manager Kenny Dalglish.\u201d Powar continued:  \u201cLiverpool have been too keen to support their man and in doing so have whipped up a sense of paranoia amongst their fans. \u201cFor the club to be so aggressively militate against what looks to most people a considered judgment from the English FA leads to a potential for anarchy.\u201d The comments came after Suarez issued a brief apology on the official Liverpool website, saying:  \u201cI admitted to the FA commission that I said a word in Spanish once and only once.  \u201cI told the panel members that I will not use it again on a football pitch in England. I never, ever used this word in a derogatory way and if it offends anyone then I want to apologize for that.\u201d Suarez pointedly did not apologize to Evra, or mention the Manchester United defender in his statement, prompting Lord Ouseley, the chairman of British football\u2019s anti-racism group Kick It Out, to call the apology \u201clamentable.\u201d \u201cSuarez\u2019s attempt at a belated apology is nothing short of lamentable,\u201d Ouseley told the Guardian newspaper.  \u201cI cannot believe that a club of Liverpool\u2019s stature, and with how it has previously led on matters of social injustice and inequality, can allow its integrity and credibility to be debased by such crass and ill-considered responses.\u201d Although Liverpool decided not to appeal against Suarez\u2019s suspension, Dalglish has publicly expressed his disappointment over the ruling and questioned the FA\u2019s reasoning for its ruling. Suarez\u2019s Liverpool teammates also courted controversy before it was announced, publicly supporting the Uruguay striker by wearing t-shirts bearing his name prior to the match against Wigan."

The 23-year-old spent three years with Red Bull\u2019s sister team Toro Rosso, but was dropped by the Italy-based outfit ahead of the forthcoming campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s good to remain with Red Bull for another year and have this opportunity with the world championship-winning team,\u201d Buemi told the sport\u2019s official website.  \u201cI would prefer to be driving at the races of course, but working with Red Bull on the development of their car and providing them with feedback throughout the season is the next best thing.\u201d Buemi finished 15th in the drivers\u2019 standings last season with 15 points, 11 points adrift of his Spanish teammate Jaime Alguersuari.  His best finishes in 2011 came at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix and in Hungary, where he finished eighth on both occasions. The 2012 Formula One season will begin with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on March 18. Meanwhile, Frenchman Cyril Despres won Thursday\u2019s fifth motorcycle stage of the Dakar Rally, ahead of Spanish rival Marc Coma, to consolidate his overall lead. Despres won the 184km stage to Fiambala in Argentina by one minute 41 seconds from Coma and now has a 9:51 lead over his fellow-KTM rider. In the car section, Qatar\u2019s defending champion Nasser al-Attiyah lost more than 20 minutes after his Hummer overheated, with Mini driver Krzysztof Holowczyc of Poland winning the stage. Holowczyc finished just over a minute ahead of American Remy Gordon with overall leader Stephane Peterhansel back in third. The result means Peterhansel now leads Holowczyc by 4:18 in the standings while al-Attiyah has dropped to eighth place overall, over 50 minutes down on the leader."

        "content": "Fifth seed Kim Clijsters booked her place in the semifinals of the Brisbane International on Thursday with a comfortable 6-3 6-2 win over Czech Iveta Benesova. The former world number one has won eight matches in a row at the Queensland event stretching back to her 2010 triumph, having skipped the tournament last year. Four-time grand slam winner Clijsters looked in good shape ahead of her Australian Open title defense later this month, wrapping up victory in one hour and 19 minutes against a player who eliminated Australian top seed Sam Stosur in the previous round. \u201cI\u2019m starting to feel more confident,\u201d the 28-year-old told the tournament website. \u201cThe little bit of the up and down maybe I had in my previous matches, especially in the one against Ana (Ivanovic), that wasn\u2019t there, which was good.\u201d Clijsters will next face Slovakia\u2019s Daniela Hantuchova, who received a walkover following the withdrawal of 13-time grand slam champion Serena Williams on Wednesday. Italian third seed Francesca Schiavone came from behind to beat Serbia\u2019s Jelena Jankovic 5-7 7-6 (7-2) 6-3 as she struggled to hold her serve. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t go there, down 3-0, 5-3 and 3-1,\u201d the frustrated 31-year-old said. \u201cI could finish faster. I will try to not do it again.\u201d Her semifinal opponent is Estonia\u2019s Kaia Kanepi, who shocked second seed and 2011 runner-up Andrea Petkovic of Germany. Kanepi spurned four match points before sealing a 6-1 7-6 (9-7) victory at a packed Pat Rafter Arena. Meanwhile, top seed Sabine Lisicki is out of the ASB Classic in New Zealand after withdrawing from her quarterfinal due to an abdominal injury.   The German, seeking her fourth career title in Auckland, lost the first set against compatriot Angelique Kerber and trailed 3-4 in the second when she pulled out. \u201cI have something with my abdominals, it hurts when I serve,\u201d the 22-year-old said. \u201cI kept fighting. I tried it. Unfortunately I couldn\u2019t finish.\u201d Kerber next faces Italian fourth seed Flavia Pennetta in a repeat of the 2011 U.S. quarterfinal, which the German won. Penetta advanced by beating Russia\u2019s Elena Vesnina 6-1 6-2. Russian third seed Svetlana Kuznetsova and China\u2019s Zheng Jie will contest the other semifinal, after defeating Italy\u2019s Sara Errani and Lucie Hredecka of the Czech Republic respectively. Elsewhere,  France booked their place in the Hopman Cup final with victory over Spain in their winner-takes-all Group B clash. World No.9 Marion Bartoli claimed the opening rubber for France, beating Anabel Medina Garrigues 6-2 6-4 . Richard Gasquet defeated Fernando Verdasco by the score to hand France an unassailable 2-0 lead and a place in Saturday\u2019s final. In the other Group B tie, hosts Australia restored a degree of pride with a 2-1 win over China. The 2011 French Open champion Li Na gave China a 1-0 in the dead-rubber tie with victory over Jarmila Gajdosova. But two-time grand slam champion Lleyton Hewitt responded for Australia by scoring a 6-4 7-5 win over Wu Di. Australia clinched victory in the doubles rubber by winning the first to eight games \u201cPro-set\u201d 8-5.   "

        "content": "Thomas Muster believes in reinvention, and he doesn\u2019t do things by half measures. The former \u201cKing of Clay\u201d beat career-threatening injuries at the age of 21 to become Austria\u2019s first grand slam tennis champion and only world No. 1 player. But he shocked everyone by disappearing into early retirement in Australia. After years of excessively good living, he made his top-level comeback at the age of 43, having lost 25 kilograms in a punishing get-fit regime. And now, after finally putting his racket down a year or so later, with his desire to compete on court at the highest level sated again, Muster will focus on his family and wine-making business. \u201cWhen I went back to Austria I was looking for property. I grew up in this area and I knew these vineyards and property and the streets around it,\u201d he says of the Hochkittenberg wine estate he bought off a church diocese in 2004. A winning partnership Muster teamed up with vintner Manfred Tement, who cultivates the eight hectares of land and put out their first joint Toms Hochkittenberg wine in 2005. \u201cHe\u2019s a great tennis fan and I asked him if this vineyard was worth a dollar. He said it\u2019s a fantastic vineyard and it\u2019s got great soil and everything you need,\u201d the Liebnitz-born father of two told CNN\u2019s Open Court.  \u201cThat\u2019s how we started working together and that\u2019s how he started developing the vineyard around our house. Now it\u2019s a beautiful area with sauvignon, burgundy and muscatel grapes.  \u201cIt\u2019s all about the Styrian wines, it\u2019s about white wines \u2013 85 or 90% of our produce is white wine or white grapes. It\u2019s one of the best sauvignon areas in the world. It\u2019s still undiscovered here, that\u2019s what we like about it, but I think in the next few years people are going to find out where this is.\u201d Muster won the French Open in 1995 and was the world\u2019s top-ranked player for six weeks the following year before quitting in 1999. It turns out he has the same passion for grapes as he did on the court. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely be here and it\u2019s lovely to be back home. Manfred loves tennis and I love wine. It\u2019s not my profession, it\u2019s my passion,\u201d says Muster, who also produces bottled spring water from the Styrian Hochschwab area.  \u201cHe\u2019s such a great teacher and over the last years I\u2019ve learned so much about wine, about the culture of wine, It\u2019s a great adventure. I love him as a friend and we have such a great time in the vineyards.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard work. To work a vineyard, you need a lot of guts to do that. To go out there and work all year, you almost feel that these people talk to the grapes. Wine is a lifestyle and you can talk about it for ages. It\u2019s a passion but it\u2019s not something I can do on a daily basis.\u201d Disappearing Down Under When Muster moved to Australia after feeling burned out by tennis, he quickly ballooned in weight to almost 100 kg. \u201cWhen I lost to Nicolas Lapentti on Court Two at the French Open I knew this was going to be my last match and it was very emotional for me,\u201d he recalls.  \u201cOn the other hand it was so great to feel like, \u2018I don\u2019t have to get up in the morning and practice!\u2019 When I went back home I threw everything I had related to tennis in the bin. I was so tired of playing tennis, so tired of traveling, of hotels, everything related to this sport. \u201cMaybe I should have just taken six months off. I don\u2019t know if this was the solution but I just felt that I was ready to stop.\u201d Known as the King of Clay before Gustavo Kuerten and Rafael Nadal came on the scene, Muster won a record 12 tournaments in 1995 \u2013 a feat that was not matched until Roger Federer in 2004.  He won 40 of his 44 career titles on clay, but was also a strong competitor on hard courts as he twice reached the semifinals of the Australian Open and made the U.S. Open quarterfinals on three occasions. Overcoming adversity It was in the United States where his career almost ended in 1989, when he was hit by a drunk driver in the car park at the event now known as the Miami Masters in Key Biscayne, where he was due to play the final the next day. \u201cComing back from two sets down (against former French Open champion Yannick Noah) and achieving top 10, you\u2019re entering the level everyone wants to be in. Then I\u2019m seeing myself in hospital a couple of hours later and having a smashed knee. It was devastating,\u201d Muster recalls.  \u201cBut I didn\u2019t really know meant to have ligaments torn, I didn\u2019t know the consequences that people have after that. So I was very positive. I thought it was going to be a few weeks and I\u2019ll be walking again, running again. But looking back it was a really, really hard time suffering from that injury. \u201cWe started rehab straight away and it helped me a lot. I stayed in a rehab center for three months, working every day. I knew I couldn\u2019t run, but I had that touch, hitting balls and that routine I was going through, getting up, practicing, having therapy, doing weights.  \u201cAs soon as I could walk again I was able to play pretty good tennis because it was a great chance to build up my upper body. I almost felt like a chicken before, really skinny.\u201d The King of Clay In 1995 Muster won 40 consecutive matches on clay, the best run since Bjorn Borg\u2019s 46 successive victories. Nadal surpassed that mark when he won 81 in a row from 2005-07.  Muster returned to Key Biscayne and beat two-time French Open champion Sergi Bruguera of Spain in the 1997 final. It was to be his last ATP Tour title, with final defeats in Cincinnati later that year and Estoril in 1998. After his last outing at Roland Garros, he decided to skip Wimbledon \u2013 where he is the only top-ranked player to have never won a singles match on the hallowed grass courts in London. \u201cI just didn\u2019t come back and then suddenly people started asking, \u2018Where is Thomas, why isn\u2019t he playing?\u2019 The press started to call me and I said, \u2018I\u2019m going on a holiday and I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to return,\u2019 so I never actually retired,\u201d Muster explains. He went to Australia, got married and had a son \u2013 and completely forgot about tennis. \u201cI gave up everything I had in Europe and moved to a town north of Brisbane called Noosa Heads. I was 99 kilos, I smoked two packs of cigarettes a day,\u201d Muster says. \u201cWhen we got divorced it was a time to come back home. It\u2019s my secure place, my haven with my family. I came back here to get grounded again, and that\u2019s also when I started to play tennis again.\u201d Back to basics Working out up to seven hours a day, Muster soon trimmed down again and was able to compete on the seniors\u2019 Champions Tour. But the desire to play at the top level burned deeply, and he started again from the bottom on the Challenger circuit, where he found victories difficult to come by. \u201cIt was a completely mad decision \u2013 but it was great, I would do it any time again. I had the best time in the past year and a half \u2026 to practice, to play, to get fit, to fight these guys and not be given a game,\u201d he says.  \u201cI took my car and my coach, and we were driving thousands and thousands of kilometers. We had to drop in our keys to get three balls and a towel \u2013 all things that are given at the big tournaments where they pick you up with great cars and they have the hospitality, food all day, trainers, physios.  \u201cYou go to a Challenger and it\u2019s in the middle of nowhere, there\u2019s no sun shining for you, a little crowd of a few hundred spectators. Okay I lost all those matches, I won a few, but it was great, it was grounding.\u201d Family ties Muster finally called it quits at the highest level at his home tournament in Vienna in October, losing in the first round. \u201cI decided to retire in Vienna because I left the scene very quietly and never had the chance to say goodbye,\u201d he says. \u201cI was never homesick when I played before, but now when I leave, when I see my daughter and I have to pack my bags, it\u2019s like, \u2018Do I have to go?\u2019 And when I lose I want to come back, and that\u2019s not a good sign for a professional player, you have to want to be out there. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stretch it to a limit where people think I\u2019m stupid what I\u2019m doing. I want to be respected for what I did. I don\u2019t want to use wild-cards for players who deserve it.  \u201cIt\u2019s been a great honor but at the end I want to say it\u2019s been a great time. I want to play a couple of senior tour events next year, but that\u2019s the level I can play at. You don\u2019t want to play tennis at 50 on a competitive level. \u201cI think my family needs me more than anybody else, and tennis doesn\u2019t need me anymore. I respect my wife a lot for taking all that in. She said, \u2018I didn\u2019t marry a tennis player, you\u2019d retired.\u2019 Now it\u2019s time to do something else.\u201d"

        "content": "Manchester United\u2019s hopes of retaining the Premier League title suffered a setback on Wednesday as the English champions slumped to a 3-0 defeat at Newcastle. Superb strikes from Demba Ba and Yohan Cabaye plus a late Phil Jones own goal earned the home side a deserved victory and condemned United to a second successive loss following Saturday\u2019s shock 3-2 home defeat by bottom club Blackburn. The result, United\u2019s first away reverse this season, left Alex Ferguson\u2019s second-placed team three points behind rivals Manchester City, with Tottenham in third another three points behind with a game in hand. Early season pace-setters Newcastle came into the match on the back of a poor recent run of just one win in eight matches, a sequence which had seen Alan Pardew\u2019s side slump to seventh in the table. Who are the top January transfer targets? But they were always the dominant side against a disjointed United, and it was no surprise when the hosts took a 33rd-minute lead when top scorer Ba superbly swiveled on the edge of the area before smashing home his 15th goal of the season. Newcastle doubled the lead early in the second half with another spectacular goal, as Cabaye curled home a delightful long-range free-kick that hit the underside of the crossbar before bouncing over the goal-line of keeper Anders Lindegaard \u2013 who was recalled in place of David De Gea. United\u2019s miserable night was complete in the final minute when a long ball from Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul was turned into his own net by England defender Jones. Newcastle remained in seventh place, though now just a point behind Liverpool. In Wednesday\u2019s other English Premier League match, Bolton moved off the bottom after recovering from a goal behind to win 2-1 at Everton. The home side took a 63rd-minute lead in freak circumstances when Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard\u2019s long clearance flew over his opposite number Adam Bogdan and into the net. However, former Liverpool striker David Ngog leveled for the visitors just four minutes later before captain Gary Cahill \u2013 who has been linked with a move to Chelsea during the transfer window \u2013 smashed home the winner with 12 minutes remaining. In Spain, Barcelona put one foot into the quarterfinals of the Copa del Rey with a 4-0 victory at home to Osasuna in the first leg of their last-16 tie. Cesc Fabregas netted twice in the first half and Lionel Messi came off the substitutes\u2019 bench to add another couple after the break to give Pep Guardiola\u2019s side a healthy advantage ahead of next week\u2019s return match.

        "content": "Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, has taken the first step toward carving out her own public role with the announcement Thursday of the U.K. charities she has chosen to support as patron.  They include a group that provides art therapy to children, the National Portrait Gallery and an organization that helps those struggling with addiction. Until now, the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s official public appearances have been in a supporting role to her husband, Prince William. But after three months of research, Catherine has chosen the causes she wants to support in her own right, two of which reflect her personal interests as a student of art history. One is the Art Room, a tiny charity that helps disadvantaged children express themselves, develop self-esteem and learn life skills through art. Juli Beattie, the Art Room\u2019s founder and director, said it was \u201ccompletely overwhelming\u201d to have such a high-profile figure lend her name to the charity. \u201cThe duchess is fascinated by art,\u201d she told CNN. Sandy Nairne, director of the National Portrait Gallery, said Catherine\u2019s knowledge of the subject had also made an impression with staff there. \u201cWhen she spent time with us, it was very clear she was showing a strong interest in our collection, in the way we work with the young people, how we develop our research, how we make our exhibitions,\u201d Nairne said. \u201cAll of those things she wanted to know more about. Clearly she\u2019d done her studies well at St. Andrews (University), and that was absolutely showing,\u201d he said. The National Portrait Gallery has a famous collection of royal paintings and photographs \u2013 and the duchess is already in talks to have her first official portrait commissioned, Nairne said. Catherine will also become patron of East Anglia\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospices, which help children and young people with life-threatening conditions. Perhaps more controversially for some, she will become patron of Action on Addiction, which runs a network of addiction treatment centers across England. The hope is that her patronage can help remove the stigma from addiction in the way that William\u2019s mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, changed public attitudes through her support for people diagnosed with HIV and AIDS worldwide. Nick Barton, chief executive of Action on Addiction, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy subject for some people \u2013 but I think this sort of patronage will change that.\u201d The charity helps those with addiction issues, as well as providing support for families of addicts, training for professionals and backing for research. The duchess has also announced that she will be hitting the outdoors as a voluntary helper with the Scout Association, of which Queen Elizabeth II is the patron. Chief Scout Bear Grylls, famous in Britain for his televised adventures in the wild, said: \u201cI think what\u2019s lovely is that she\u2019s going to feel exactly the way young Scouts feel when they first join: a little bit nervous. But that\u2019s what scouting\u2019s about. You\u2019re part of a big family.\u201d More than 400,000 young men and women are involved with the Scout Association across the United Kingdom. Catherine is expected to volunteer primarily with younger members of the organization, helping out at Cub Scout and Beaver Scout groups near the north Wales home she shares with Prince William and elsewhere, her office said. The late Diana, Princess of Wales, was defined by her charity work, whether supporting those with AIDS or campaigning for a ban on anti-personnel landmines.  The Duchess of Cambridge can expect plenty of attention in turn as she embraces her new roles."

The 35-year-old finished over two minutes ahead of Despres, leaving the Frenchman still eight minutes and 10 seconds ahead of Coma in the overall standings. The pair are already well clear of their rivals, with third-placed Helder Rodrigues of Portugal, who finished fourth on the day, nearly 27 minutes adrift. Coma, who is playing catch-up after losing 10 minutes on Tuesday when he took the wrong route, told reporters: \u201cI tried to drive at a very high pace from the beginning, but it was difficult. \u201cI was able to overtake a few drivers and gain some time on Cyril and I will keep on fighting every day.\u201d Meanwhile, nine-time overall winner Stephane Peterhansel took the lead in the car section after coming home first in Wednesday\u2019s stage. The 46-year-old Mini driver finished five minutes and 19 seconds ahead of Argentinian Orlando Terranova in a Toyota, while South African Giniel De Villiers was third, also in a Toyota.

Nadal told reporters he was happy with the way he played, saying:  \u201cThe worst thing I did last year was my return and I was happy with the way my return worked today. \u201cI also want to have enough shots not to be predictable. I want to attack  the ball faster and hit with more power and spin,\u201d he added.

        "content": "A body found on Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s estate in Sandringham is that of a young white woman aged 15 to 23, investigators working on a murder probe said Wednesday. Police were alerted Sunday to the human remains, found by a member of the public near the village of Anmer, in the English county of Norfolk. Investigators said initial analysis of the remains had not yielded a DNA profile, which they had hoped might identify the woman. Further tests are being carried out, with the results expected Thursday, a police statement said. \u201cOfficers will also look at more traditional methods of identifying the victim, which may take longer,\u201d it added. The body had been at the site between one and four months, the Joint Norfolk and Suffolk Major Investigation Team said. Further searches of the area will continue Thursday.  Anmer, which lies within the bounds of the 20,000-acre estate, is near the town of King\u2019s Lynn. Investigators said Tuesday they would be looking at cold cases as part of the probe. Sandringham House, at the heart of the rural estate, is where the royal family traditionally gathers to celebrate Christmas. It\u2019s been the private home of four generations of British monarchs since 1862, and is one of two private residences used by the queen. Part of the estate is a 600-acre country park open to the public. A Buckingham Palace spokesman told CNN Tuesday Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip \u201care in residence at Sandringham from mid-December to the end of January. \u201cIt is a private residence, we cannot confirm whether or not the queen has been informed or not,\u201d the spokesman said, referring to the murder investigation. Prince Philip has been recuperating at Sandringham since he was released from the hospital just over a week ago after having a coronary stent implanted.

        "content": "U.S. civil rights activist Jesse Jackson has challenged the UK to do more to tackle racism following the conviction of two men for a notorious racist murder more than 18 years ago. Gary Dobson and David Norris were both sentenced in London Wednesday to more than 14 years in jail for killing black teenager Stephen Lawrence in 1993. But it took nearly two decades of campaigning by the Lawrence family and others, a change in the law and modern forensic techniques to bring the pair to justice. London\u2019s Metropolitan Police had previously admitted there had been failures in the initial investigation and were criticized by the 1999 Macpherson inquiry, ordered by the government to examine the case. Speaking in London, Jackson told CNN the verdict could be a significant moment, adding: \u201cBritain has an obligation to turn this crisis into an opportunity.\u201d The two convicted men were part of a gang of five that attacked Lawrence but the other three men remain free. \u201cEvidence suggests that they barely caught them,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe investigation was slow and incomplete. It also suggests that there are three more on the loose\u2026 and that the community these young men came from incubated and protected them.\u201d   Praising the persistence of the Lawrence family in seeking justice for their son, Jackson also highlighted economic strife as a cause of racial tension in general and said the media had a responsibility to break away from \u201ccultural biases.\u201d But Jackson believes more could be done to create what he called a more integrated police service, urging black and white officers to attend crime scenes together. \u201cHaving black and white officers together creates more credibility in the way cases are handled,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we have integrated football teams then why can\u2019t we have an integrated police force? Why can\u2019t we have a black police chief?\u201d The Macpherson report accused the Metropolitan force of \u201cinstitutional racism\u201d and made 70 recommendations for change. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police told CNN Wednesday that the force was much more conscious of these issues than it was 20 years ago, but doesn\u2019t deploy officers to crime scenes on the basis of their skin color. He also pointed to progress made in recruiting a workforce that reflects London\u2019s diverse population.  A Metropolitan Police website produced 10 years on from the Macpherson report says it has improved its work with communities, the way it investigates murder and hate crime, and the way it creates a more representative workforce. The website said the force had three-and-a half-times more black and minority ethnic (BME) officers than in 1999. \u201cThis means that nearly 9% (2,700) of our police officers are BME, compared with just 3.4% (779) in 1999,\u201d it said."

        "content": "Two men have been sentenced to life in jail for the racist murder of a black teenager in London nearly 20 years after the offense. Gary Dobson and David Norris were convicted for killing Stephen Lawrence in 1993 after a fresh trial based on new forensic evidence. It was a case that shook Britain and until Tuesday\u2019s verdict was one of the country\u2019s most high-profile unsolved murders. It also led to major changes in attitudes to racism, policing and the justice system. CNN examines key questions about why the case is so important. What happened to Stephen Lawrence? The 18-year-old student and his friend Duwayne Brooks were attacked at a bus stop in south-east London by a gang of youths. Brooks managed to escape but Lawrence was fatally stabbed.  Jurors at the inquest into his death found that he was unlawfully killed in a \u201ccompletely unprovoked racist attack by five white youths.\u201d What did the police do? The Lawrence family felt that London\u2019s Metropolitan Police failed to do enough to solve the crime, and expressed fears that racism within the police force might be a factor. They made a formal complaint about the police in 1997.  The police later admitted there had been failures in the search for the killers and apologized to the Lawrence family, but the then-London police chief Paul Condon denied that the majority of police officers were racist.  After the verdict on Tuesday, Lawrence\u2019s mother Doreen said the police involved in the original investigation had put her family through huge pain and uncertainty through their failure to investigate properly.  \u201cThis result shows that the police can do their job properly \u2013 but only if they want to,\u201d she said.  Although several suspects were identified, including Dobson and Norris, officials initially said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute them. As a result, Lawrence\u2019s parents Doreen and Neville launched a private prosecution that eventually led to three suspects being acquitted. What was the reaction? Failure to solve the murder sparked widespread anger. The Lawrence family continued to campaign for justice \u2013 and the Daily Mail, a UK tabloid newspaper, even went as far as accusing five men of the killing on its front page and invited them to sue if they were wrong.   In 1997, four years after the murder, the then Home Secretary Jack Straw announced an inquiry into the crime.  The resulting Macpherson report accused the police of \u201cinstitutional racism\u201d and found that detectives had made little effort to apprehend the white youths suspected of killing Lawrence. It also made a series of recommendations intended to stamp out racism and ensure police were properly trained on the issue. The report concluded that \u201cStephen Lawrence\u2019s murder was simply and solely and unequivocally motivated by racism.\u201d  How were Dobson and Norris brought to trial? The Macpherson report also recommended that \u201cconsideration should be given to permit prosecution after acquittal where fresh and viable evidence is presented.\u201d  A centuries-old practice known as the \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d rule prevented someone already acquitted of a crime being tried again for the same offense even if there was fresh evidence. In 2005 the rule was abandoned, allowing the authorities to charge Dobson for Lawrence\u2019s murder if they could find new evidence, even though he had been previously cleared.   In 2007 there was a breakthrough brought about by new technology. During the six-week trial, jurors were told of significant new forensic evidence recovered from clothing seized from the suspects\u2019 homes 18 years ago, including a very small blood stain on the collar of a jacket taken from Dobson\u2019s wardrobe. DNA testing showed the blood was that of Lawrence. Evidence was also found linking Norris to Lawrence\u2019s death. The new forensic evidence was the result of \u201cpreviously unavailable scientific technology and techniques,\u201d said Cressida Dick, acting deputy commissioner for the Metropolitan Police.  The jury decided unanimously that Dobson and Norris were guilty of murder, rejecting defense arguments that the evidence was contaminated. Where does this leave race relations in the UK? The damning Macpherson report made 70 recommendations and called for an overhaul of the police to restore public confidence.  The Metropolitan Police has since made widespread changes, and in a statement said it now had a \u201cbetter understanding of and relationship with London\u2019s communities leading to increased confidence and trust.\u201d But it adds: \u201cWe are not complacent and recognize there is still much more to do.\u201d  The UK government has also tightened laws requiring all public bodies, including the police, to treat everyone fairly and without discrimination.  Despite this racism remains a concern. High-profile incidents have recently emerged in English football with two Premiership players being accused of making racist comments to rivals. U.S. civil rights activist Rev. Jesse Jackson told CNN there was clearly a problem in the communities that \u201cincubated and protected\u201d those convicted of killing Lawrence. He also called on UK police forces to work harder at integrating black and white officers.  \u201cBritain has an obligation to turn this crisis into an opportunity,\u201d he said.  Are there any more suspects in the Lawrence case? The original inquest found that Lawrence was killed by five white youths. Police are still seeking evidence to pursue three other suspects.  The Metropolitan Police acting deputy commissioner Cressida Dick said: \u201cWe do of course acknowledge that there are five people involved in that murder. We have not brought all those people to justice.\u201d She vowed to respond if there was new evidence."

        "content": "A long-lost picture of Britain\u2019s King Edward VIII reveals the monarch\u2019s portrait was \u201cedited\u201d after his abdication to show his replacement, King George VI. Edward VIII posed for popular periodical \u201cThe Illustrated London News\u201d in 1936, ahead of his planned coronation. But when the monarch stepped down before he was officially crowned, artist Albert H Collings recycled the image, painting over Edward\u2019s face in an early version of the \u201cairbrushing\u201d familiar to today\u2019s magazine readers. \u201cWe tend to think of it as a modern thing, but this just shows it has been going on forever,\u201d said Illustrated London News chief executive Lisa Barnard.  \u201cI suppose the thinking was that the original would never be seen, so no one would ever know,\u201d she told CNN, adding, \u201ceditors have always had to be resourceful \u2013 news changes, and they have to change with it.  \u201cWe found a note of how much the artists were paid for the portraits \u2013 hundreds of pounds, which was a lot of money at the time \u2013 and the magazine would not have wanted to waste that.\u201d The alteration came to light following the discovery of a proof copy of a special coronation edition of the magazine. When images of the coronation that never happened were published in British newspapers, one eagle-eyed reader noticed the striking similarity between the unknown painting of Edward VIII, and the image of George VI, which was published in a later issue of the periodical. Barnard said the portrait was not the only item from the unpublished Edward VIII coronation special to be recycled. \u201cThey were able to reuse some of the more general articles for the George VI coronation issue, and some other pictures of the coronation robes were also \u2018edited\u2019 to show George VI \u2013 again, the artist just changed the heads. \u201cDays after the abdication was announced, the magazine put out a special \u2018abdication and accession\u2019 edition, and they ran a whole essay which had been due to run in the coronation issue as a tribute to Edward VIII, and which became, in effect, a eulogy.\u201d It is thought the magazine\u2019s editor Sir Bruce Ingram was tipped off days before the abdication that the coronation issue might not be needed. In a page of notes attached to the proof copy and dated December 3, 1936 \u2013 a week before the official announcement \u2013 he has written a list of alterations and revisions needed \u201cif Ed. VIII abdicates.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of a smart editor, thinking on his feet and making the most of what they had,\u201d Barnard told CNN. Edward VIII became King on the death of his father, George V, in January 1936 but reigned for less than a year before stepping aside on December 11 to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. His younger brother, George VI, who had never expected to become King, was named as his successor. The story of the new monarch\u2019s struggle against a debilitating stutter in the early days of his reign was chronicled in the Oscar-winning movie \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech.\u201d"

Jose Mourinho\u2019s cup holders looked headed for an upset defeat as goals from Sergio Sanchez and Martin de Michelis saw them trailing at the hour mark before a remarkable transformation. Germany midfielder Sami Khedira and Argentina striker Gonzalo Higuain scored in quick succession to put Real level in the first round of matches since the Spanish winter break. The winner came in the 78th minute as Higuain found fellow forward Karim Benzema with a superb pass and the France international made no mistake. Real might have added a fourth as Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s spectacular bicycle kick was ruled out for offside in the last kick of a thrilling match at the Bernabeu. Malaga have become a force after the riches invested by Qatari Sheikh Abdullah, and a pair of headed goals before the half-hour mark had them dreaming of taking a lead into the second leg. But Khedira surged through their defense to pull one back before the ever-sharp Higuain took advantage of a sloppy back-pass to score from an acute angle. Benzema\u2019s winner after he came close with an earlier volleyed effort left Real favorites to progress to the quarterfinals in next week\u2019s return legs. However, Levante suffered a 2-1 defeat at second division Alcorcon and La Liga strugglers Racing Santander crashed 2-0 at third-tier Mirandes. Athletic Bilbao, seeking a 24th cup title but first since 1984, drew 0-0 at lower league Albacete. On Wednesday, last year\u2019s finalists Barcelona host Osasuna while Real Sociedad take on Mallorca in another top-flight tie.

        "content": "Two men who were found guilty of the racist murder of a black teenager in London were sentenced Wednesday to more than 14 years in prison each, the court said.  Gary Dobson and David Norris were convicted Tuesday in the killing of Stephen Lawrence in 1993, after a trial based on new forensic evidence. The judge said at the sentencing that the crime was committed for no reason other than racial hatred, British media reported. Dobson was sentenced to serve at least 15 years and two months in prison, while Norris got a minimum of 14 years and three months, the court said. Norris will be given credit for just over a year that he has already served on remand.  Both technically were given indefinite sentences \u2013 ordered to serve \u201cat Her Majesty\u2019s pleasure.\u201d Dobson\u2019s father shouted \u201cShame on you all,\u201d to the packed courtroom as the sentence was read out, British media reported. British law required Dobson and Norris to be sentenced as if they were minors because they were teens when they killed Lawrence. The conviction was the culmination of a case that has gripped the British media for almost two decades and resulted in a government inquiry in 1999 that was heavily critical of the police for their handling of the case. Changes brought about as a result of the Macpherson Report in 1999 \u2013 which labeled the Metropolitan Police force \u201cinstitutionally racist\u201d and said its investigation of the murder was fundamentally flawed \u2013 continue to impact how the police and legal system operate today. Speaking outside court, Lawrence\u2019s mother, Doreen Lawrence, expressed her gratitude to those who had supported the family through their long fight for justice. It was a \u201cdifficult day,\u201d she said, but the judge had recognized the stress and suffering the family had gone through and handed down the longest sentences he could under the law. The judge also recognized the men for what they had done, she said, \u201cand there\u2019s no hiding behind their ages.\u201d Dobson was 17 and Norris 16 at the time of the murder. Stephen Lawrence\u2019s father, Neville Lawrence, told reporters he hoped to be standing outside the court in a year\u2019s time marking the sentencing of the other men allegedly involved in his son\u2019s death. Other youths who were with Norris and Dobson on the night of the murder have long also been suspects in the case. However, extensive re-examination of material gathered at the time has not yet produced evidence for a prosecution. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe told the BBC Wednesday that \u201cthe other people involved in the murder of Stephen Lawrence should not rest easily in their beds.\u201d Deborah Glass, deputy chair of the Independent Police Complaints Commission \u2013 a body set up as a result of that government inquiry \u2013 paid tribute to the efforts of the Lawrence family. \u201cThere can be no doubt that in their struggle they were also instrumental in bringing much-needed fundamental reform to policing in this country,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cIt is important to acknowledge the changes that have been made over the past decade, but there is equally no doubt that much remains to be done to increase the confidence of black and minority ethnic communities in policing.\u201d While the initial murder inquiry had been \u201ctruly shocking in its negligence,\u201d she added, the current investigation team deserved credit for its work on the case. Speaking outside court Tuesday, Doreen Lawrence told reporters that she felt \u201crelief that these racist men no longer feel they can murder a black man and get away with it.\u201d But, she said, the court\u2019s decision was not a cause for celebration. \u201cThese verdicts will not bring my son back,\u201d she said. \u201cHow can I celebrate when my son lies buried, when I can\u2019t see him or speak to him?\u201d She had harsh words for the police involved in the original investigation, saying they had put her family through huge pain and uncertainty through their failure to investigate properly. \u201cThis result shows that the police can do their job properly \u2013 but only if they want to,\u201d she said. \u201cI only hope that they have learned their lesson and don\u2019t put any other family through what we\u2019ve been put through.\u201d Lawrence, who was 18 when he was stabbed to death in southeast London in an unprovoked attack, was a good student who had applied to study architecture at university. Stephen was a son any mother would have been proud of, Doreen Lawrence said, and she missed him with a \u201cpassion.\u201d The Macpherson Report concluded that \u201cStephen Lawrence\u2019s murder was simply and solely and unequivocally motivated by racism.\u201d During the six-week trial, jurors were told of significant new forensic evidence recovered from clothing seized from the suspects\u2019 homes 18 years ago, including a very small blood stain on the collar of a jacket taken from Dobson\u2019s closet. DNA testing indicated the blood was that of Lawrence. Evidence was also found linking Norris to Lawrence\u2019s death. The new forensic evidence was the result of \u201cpreviously unavailable scientific technology and techniques,\u201d said Cressida Dick, acting deputy commissioner for the Metropolitan Police. The defense claimed that the incriminating evidence was the result of cross-contamination after the clothing was seized by police. Dobson had previously appeared in court in 1996 in connection with the Lawrence murder, but that case \u2013 a private prosecution brought by the Lawrence family \u2013 collapsed and he was acquitted. His latest trial on the same charge was allowed thanks to a change in the centuries-old \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d law under which a person who had been acquitted could not be tried again for the same offense. In a change that came into effect in 2005 in England and Wales, a second trial is allowed if substantial new evidence emerges. The head of the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, set up by the teenager\u2019s parents to help young people who want to study architecture, said Tuesday he welcomed the verdict \u201cwith a sense of huge relief.\u201d \u201cThroughout the 18-year ordeal, the Lawrence family\u2019s desire has been the pursuit of justice \u2013 today, justice was served,\u201d chief executive Paul Anderson-Walsh said in a written statement."

However, one of the pictures seen on cigarette packets this week \u2013which was cleared by the ministry and included in a May 2011 press release \u2013 does show a strong resemblance to Terry. An official at India\u2019s Directorate of Advertising and Visual Publicity earlier confirmed that the image had been cleared by the health ministry. \u201cWe sent the creative to the health ministry and they then cleared it and circulated it,\u201d KS Dhatwalia told the Indian Express. \u201cBut how Terry\u2019s picture got to be used is not clear.\u201d Terry faces court proceedings in February after being charged by London police with racially abusing an opponent.

        "content": "Four-time grand slam champion Kim Clijsters battled back from facing break point at 0-3 down in the deciding set against former world number one Ana Ivanovic Tuesday to reach the quarterfinals of the Brisbane International in Australia. Belgium\u2019s Clijsters saw her early dominance challenged as Ivanovic took the second set for the loss of only a game and rushed into a 3-0 lead in the decider. But the fifth seed fought back to win six straight games and close out a 6-1 1-6 6-3 victory. \u201cI knew that if I could just give myself the opportunity to get back into the match and rally for it and not give her anything for free, she really had to go for the winners and dictate the points,\u201d Clijsters, 28, told the tournament\u2019s official website. Fifth seed Clijsters, winner of this tournament in 2010, will come up against 2011 U.S. Open champion and top seed Samantha Stosur or the Czech Republic\u2019s Iveta Benesova in the next round. They play Wednesday when 13-time grand slam winner Serena Williams will also be in action.   World No. 13 Clijsters is playing her first WTA event since August and is hoping for a good run at the Queensland Tennis Centre before beginning the defense of her Australian Open crown later this month. Second seed Andrea Petkovic joined Clijsters in the last eight after eventually defeating spirited Czech Barbora Zahlavova Strycova 6-2 4-6 6-4. Italian third seed Francesca Schiavone also advanced courtesy of a 6-4 6-4 triumph against Kazakhstan\u2019s Galina Voskoboeva. Also victorious was Slovakia\u2019s Daniela Hantuchova, who came from behind against American Vania King to win 4-6 6-2 6-3. Elsewhere on the WTA Tour, Germany\u2019s Julia Goerges overcame illness to defeat 2011 champion Greta Arn at the ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand. The first round clash was a repeat of last year\u2019s semifinal, with fifth seed Goerges gaining revenge over her Hungarian opponent with a 7-5 3-6 6-4 success. \u201cI didn\u2019t really feel that well but when you go on court you want try to be 100 per cent\u2026 It\u2019s pretty tough somehow to beat a player like Greta but somehow I managed it,\u201d Goerges told the tournament\u2019s official website. Second seed Shuai Peng is also into the second round after surviving an early shock to defeat French qualifier and 2008 runner-up Aravane Rezai 4-6 6-3 6-4. The Chinese world No.17\u2019s reward is a clash with the Czech Republic\u2019s Lucie Hradecka. Two-time grand slam winner Svetlana Kuznetsova was also a winner on Tuesday, getting the better of American Alison Riske 6-3 6-2. The Russian will face another American, Christina McHale, in the second round. Meanwhile, hosts Australia saw their Hopman Cup hopes ended after a 2-1 defeat to France in Group A of the Perth tournament. Marion Bartoli got France off to the perfect start with a devastating 6-0 6-0 thrashing of Jarmila Gajdosova in the match\u2019s opening rubber, with the Australian reduced to tears after suffering the first double bagel loss in the tournament since 1991. France maintained their 100% record in the group when Richard Gasquet battled to a 6-2 5-7 6-1 win over former world No.1 Lleyton Hewitt, who is regaining fitness following a four-month injury lay-off. With a second consecutive defeat already assured for Australia following Sunday\u2019s 2-1 loss to Spain, France made it a clean sweep with a 6-3 6-4 success in the final dead rubber doubles match. \u201cIt\u2019s always tough to beat him,\u201d Gasquet told the tournament\u2019s official website after his first career defeat of Hewitt. \u201cI\u2019ve lost twice against him and I know he\u2019s a great warrior and a champion.  \u201cHe knows tennis and (is) one of the best players of the history but I\u2019m really happy to win against him. I\u2019ve been watching him from when I was a child so it was a good victory for me.\u201d Also in Group B, Spain joined France in making it two wins from two matches with a 2-1 success over China. The day had started well for China, with 2011 French Open champion Li Na recording a 6-3 6-1 victory over Medina Garrigues in the match\u2019s opening rubber. But world No.7 Fernando Verdasco leveled the clash with a 6-3 6-4 win against Wu Di, before Spain clinched the match with a comfortable 6-0 6-2 win in the deciding doubles clash. The decisive contest between France and Spain which will decide who advances to the final from Group B will take place Thursday. "

        "content": "French presidential candidate Francois Hollande opened the new year with a shot across the bow of rival President Nicolas Sarkozy Tuesday. In an open letter published in French newspaper Liberation, Hollande accuses Sarkozy \u2013 who is seeking re-election this spring \u2013 of failing to do enough to help his people during his term in office. \u201cThe French suffer. They suffer in their daily lives. Unemployment is at its highest because growth is at its lowest,\u201d writes Hollande, who is widely regarded as Sarkozy\u2019s chief rival.  \u201cThe economic depression is here, social anxiety is everywhere, and confidence is at its lowest ebb. I am re-affirming where the responsibilities lie. Certainly, since 2008, there is a crisis.\u201d The 57-year-old Socialist Party candidate devotes much of his letter to criticism on the president\u2019s handling of the economic downturn afflicting France and its European neighbors, but also sets out his own vision for the future. Hollande\u2019s remarks come ahead of Sarkozy\u2019s planned trip to Berlin next Monday for further meetings with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The pair have met repeatedly in recent months as they seek to stabilize the 17-nation, single-currency eurozone to which both France and Germany belong. It is time for a new leader, Hollande argues. \u201cAllow the change, a true change. This is not the place to analyze what might have been in the past five-year term. Said simply, the past five years have been a presidency of the speech and him, the privileged president.\u201d Hollande, who was picked as his party\u2019s candidate in primaries in October, was responding to a New Year\u2019s message from the French president in which he called for a united France to weather the economic storm. The French go to the polls later this year, with the first round of the presidential elections scheduled for April 22 and the second round for May 6. Former French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin has also said he will run for president. He heads his own center-right party, Republique Solidaire."

The Prospero Collection features coins of historical and artistic importance, including one described by an expert as \u201ca masterpiece of ancient Greek art.\u201d Assembled by a private collector over three decades, from 1960 to 1991, the treasure trove has remained untouched for the past 20 years.  After so long out of the spotlight, the coins have attracted serious interest from potential buyers around the world and at recent viewings in the U.S. and the UK. Paul Hill, ancient Greek coin specialist at dealers A. H.

He said that while most of the lots were likely to sell to collectors, coins were increasingly being seen as an attractive investment, given the global financial crisis. \u201cThey are of great artistic beauty and historical significance, which makes them more interesting than stocks or shares, and they are tangible and portable, compared to a big estate.\u201d \u201cSuch passion has gone into the collection, and it has been an important part of somebody\u2019s life for so long, that there is an element of sadness to see it split up,\u201d Hill told CNN.  \u201cBut it is lovely to see it published together now, for posterity, before it is \u2018recycled\u2019 and finds new homes with new collectors all over the world.\u201d"

        "content": "Two men were found guilty in London Tuesday of the racist murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence in 1993, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police said. Gary Dobson and David Norris were found guilty at the Old Bailey courthouse after a trial based on new forensic evidence recovered after a cold case review. Their conviction is the culmination of a case that has gripped the British media for almost two decades and resulted in a government inquiry that was heavily critical of the police for their handling of the case. Lawrence\u2019s mother, Doreen Lawrence, told reporters outside court that she felt \u201crelief that these racist men no longer feel they can murder a black man and get away with it.\u201d But, she said, the court\u2019s decision is not a cause for celebration. \u201cThese verdicts will not bring my son back,\u201d she said. \u201cHow can I celebrate when my son lies buried, when I can\u2019t see him or speak to him?\u201d She had harsh words for the police involved in the original investigation, saying they had put her family through huge pain and uncertainty through their failure to investigate properly. \u201cThis result shows that the police can do their job properly \u2013 but only if they want to,\u201d she said. \u201cI only hope that they have learned their lesson and don\u2019t put any other family through what we\u2019ve been put through.\u201d Duwayne Brooks, a friend of Lawrence who was with him on the night of the murder and testified in the course of the trial, posted on Twitter: \u201cSome justice at last.\u201d  Dobson, 36, and Norris, 35, will be sentenced Wednesday. They had denied the murder charge. Cressida Dick, acting deputy commissioner for the Metropolitan Police, paid tribute to the \u201ccourage and dignity\u201d Lawrence\u2019s parents had shown throughout their long pursuit of justice.  \u201cThey have contributed to major changes within policing, the law and society as a whole,\u201d she said. During the six-week trial, jurors were told of significant new forensic evidence recovered from clothing seized from the suspects\u2019 homes 18 years ago, including a very small blood stain on the collar of a jacket taken from Dobson\u2019s wardrobe. DNA testing showed the blood was that of Lawrence. Evidence was also found linking Norris to Lawrence\u2019s death. The new forensic evidence was the result of \u201cpreviously unavailable scientific technology and techniques,\u201d Dick said. The defense claimed that the incriminating evidence was the result of cross-contamination after the clothing was seized by police. Lawrence was 18 when he was stabbed to death in southeast London in an unprovoked attack. He was a good student who had applied to study architecture at university. The Macpherson Report in 1999 labeled the Metropolitan Police force \u201cinstitutionally racist\u201d and said its investigation of the murder was fundamentally flawed. It also made a series of recommendations intended to stamp out racism and ensure police were properly trained on the issue. The report concluded that \u201cStephen Lawrence\u2019s murder was simply and solely and unequivocally motivated by racism.\u201d Dobson had previously appeared in court in 1996 accused of the murder of Lawrence but that case, a private prosecution brought by the Lawrence family, collapsed and he was acquitted. His latest trial on the same charge was allowed thanks to a change in the centuries-old \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d law under which a person who had been acquitted could not be tried again for the same offense. In a change that came into effect in 2005 in England and Wales, a second trial is allowed if substantial new evidence emerges. The head of the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, set up by the teenager\u2019s parents to help young people who want to study architecture, said he welcomed the verdict \u201cwith a sense of huge relief.\u201d \u201cThroughout the 18-year ordeal, the Lawrence family\u2019s desire has been the pursuit of justice \u2013 today, justice was served,\u201d chief executive Paul Anderson-Walsh said in a written statement. \u201cStephen Lawrence\u2019s murder leaves in its wake a changed criminal justice landscape, but it is a change in the social justice topography that the Lawrence family hopes will be Stephen Lawrence\u2019s lasting legacy.\u201d"

Police said the area had been sealed off while forensic investigations are carried out.  An autopsy conducted Tuesday revealed the remains were of a young woman and had been at the site for between one and four months, police said.

        "content": "Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown\u2019s e-mail may have been hacked by private investigators working for British newspapers when he was the country\u2019s top finance official, the Independent newspaper reported Monday. London\u2019s Metropolitan Police launched an investigation in June into potential computer hacking on behalf of newspapers, after opening separate investigations earlier in the year into phone hacking and police bribery. Authorities refused Monday to confirm they are investigating the potential hacking of Gordon Brown when he was chancellor under Tony Blair. Brown\u2019s office did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. But another former top government official said police had spoken to him about the possibility that both his government and personal computers were hacked. Peter Hain, a former Northern Ireland secretary who has long been at the heart of the Labour Party, said police had talked to him about potential hacking between 2005 and 2007. Much of the controversy around phone hacking has centered around the best-selling Sunday tabloid News of the World, which was shut down by proprietor James Murdoch in July in the face of the scandal. The defunct newspaper\u2019s parent company, News International, declined to comment on the Independent story. The Independent does not name the newspaper alleged to have employed the private detectives who targeted government ministers. One person has been arrested in connection with the computer hacking investigation, known as Operation Tuleta. The suspect, a 52-year-old man, was detained in the city of Milton Keynes on November 24 and released on bail until March, police said. Sixteen people have been arrested in connection with the phone-hacking probe, Operation Weeting, and eight people have been arrested in Operation Elvedon, the bribery probe \u2013 including two of the same people arrested over phone hacking.  The phone-hacking story, long a bugbear of a handful of high-profile celebrities, journalists and politicians, exploded into international prominence last summer with the revelation that people working for the News of the World illegally eavesdropped on the messages of a missing teenager who later turned out to have been murdered. Two former editors of the News of the World, Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, have been arrested and released on bail.  Prime Minister David Cameron has been criticized for hiring Coulson after the editor resigned when subordinates pleaded guilty to phone hacking. Coulson maintains that he was not aware of the illegal activity. The government set up an independent inquiry running alongside the police investigations, and parliament\u2019s media committee has held hearings with witnesses including News Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch. His son James has been called twice as lawmakers try to determine how much he knew about phone hacking. Police say notebooks belonging to a private investigator at the heart of the scandal contain the names of 5,800 potential victims. The Independent says police have seized 20 computers in connection with the e-mail hacking probe, and say the machines suggest there could be as many computer-hacking victims as phone-hacking victims. It does not name the source of the claims."

Lasting nearly five hours, the protest was organized by opposition parties and civil society groups who say the new constitution is anti-democratic. American Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed similar concerns last year, pushing Orban to commit to \u201cthe independence of the judiciary, a free press, and governmental transparency.\u201d Orban and other officials left the gala celebrating the new constitution through back doors to avoid the demonstration. The new constitution, which took effect on January  1, omits \u201crepublic\u201d from Hungary\u2019s official name, and includes several paragraphs which Amnesty International says violate international human rights. The human rights organization has been critical of sections that define life as beginning at conception and marriage as being between a man and a woman. It also expressed concerns about the possibility of life imprisonment without parole, and failure to forbid discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. Monday\u2019s demonstration was preceded by a series of protests in 2011 against laws introduced by Hungary\u2019s populist government. Critics have said the new media law is restrictive and the new electoral law favors Orban\u2019s ruling party FIDESZ. They have also taken aim at a law criminalizing homelessness. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso wrote to Orban in December requesting the withdrawal of two recent bills related to the country\u2019s financial stability and the central bank. Orban rejected the requests."

The upset result left City ahead of champions Manchester United on goal difference, having gone into the match hoping to open up a three-point lead after their neighbors were beaten 3-2 by Blackburn 24 hours earlier. Instead, Roberto Mancini\u2019s men were left to reflect on a wasted opportunity with cavalier defending in the dying moments costing them even a point. Sunderland, who had been penned in their area for much of the final few minutes, broke upfield and had a two-man advantage as Stephane Sessegnon played in Ji. Ferguson\u2019s birthday celebrations ruined On as a substitute for Niklas Bendtner, he beat England goalkeeper Joe Hart with  a composed finish. Moments before City substitute Micah Richards had thumped the crossbar after Simon Mignolet parried a David Silva shot. Edin Dzeko hit the woodwork in the first half as the leaders dominated possession, but the home side also had clear-cut chances. Bendtner wasted his before the break and Sessegnon screwed his effort wide in the second half. The three points lifted Sunderland, who have been revived under new manager Martin O\u2019Neill, to 13th place, six points clear of the drop zone. City must now entertain Liverpool on Tuesday night as they look to get their title challenge back on firmer footing. Mancini bemoaned his side\u2019s luck after the surprise defeat. \u201cWe deserved to win this game,\u201d he told Sky Sports. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible. \u201cThis is football.

The findings of the Independent Regulatory Commission were released late Saturday night on the official website of the English Football Association (FA). The detailed 115-page ruling went over the circumstances of the clash between the pair in the match at Liverpool\u2019s Anfield ground on October 15. It concluded that Suarez had called Evra a \u201cnegro\u201d no fewer than seven times during the course of the English Premier League match. The panel heard evidence from both players and also used linguistic experts to examine television footage of the game. Their investigations centered on an incident just before the hour mark after Suarez fouled the French international full-back. Dalglish defends t-shirts supporting Suarez At a subsequent Liverpool corner, Evra was marking the striker and they became involved in a fierce row. Evra made a complaint to referee Andre Mariner and again after the game, which prompted the FA investigation. Suarez, who was publicly supported by his manager Kenny Dalglish and teammates, argued before the panel that the use of he word \u201cnegro\u201d was not offensive. But the commission rejected his arguments in handing down their lengthy ban and a $62,000 fine. \u201cMr Evra was a credible witness,\u201d read its report. \u201cHe gave his evidence in a calm, composed and clear way. It was, for the most part,  consistent, although both he and Mr Suarez were understandably unable to  remember every detail of the exchanges between them. Blog: Out with the old and in with the new in 2012 \u201cMr Suarez\u2019s evidence was unreliable in relation to matters of critical  importance. It was, in part, inconsistent with the contemporaneous evidence,  especially the video footage,\u201d it added. However, the commission did not believe Suarez was \u201cracist\u201d but had used \u201cinsulting\u201d words, which was the basis of the FA charge against him. \u201cWe have found that charge proved on the evidence and arguments put before  us. The FA made clear that it did not contend that Mr Suarez acted as he did  because he is a racist. \u201cMr Evra said in his evidence that he did not think Mr Suarez is a racist.  Mr Suarez said in evidence that he will not use the word \u2018negro\u2019 on a football  pitch in England in the future, and we believe that is his genuine and firm intention.\u201d Liverpool have until January 13 to appeal, leaving Suarez free to play, including a  English League Cup semifinal first leg tie against Manchester City two days before. They issued a statement on their website to confirm receipt of the commission\u2019s report. \u201cThe player, the club and our legal advisers will now take the necessary amount of time to read, digest and properly consider the contents of the 115 page judgment and will make no further comment at present,\u201d it read. The Suarez affair comes at the same time England captain John Terry is facing a criminal charge of using racist language against QPR defender Anton Ferdinand during Chelsea\u2019s EPL game on October 23. Terry has vowed to fight the charges \u201ctooth and nail\u201d and like Suarez has received the backing of his club. The FA is postponing its action until the court proceedings are concluded early this year.   "

Arsenal needed a win to move within six points of joint leaders Manchester City and Manchester United at the top of the table. And Arsene Wenger\u2019s side looked on course to achieve the three points when Laurent Koscielny was left unmarked to head home his first goal of the season in the 21st minute. Out with the old and in with the new in 2012 London rivals Fulham had more of the possession after the break but the Arsenal defense held firm until Johan Djourou was sent off with 12 minutes remaining after collecting two yellow cards. From then, Fulham dominated and they leveled five minutes from time when midfielder Steve Sidwell nodded home from close range. And the turnaround was completed in injury time when striker Bobby Zamora smashed home a low left-foot volley after the Gunners failed to clear their lines. The result saw Arsenal drop from fourth to fifth place in the table, nine points off the top two having played a game more ahead of Tuesday\u2019s fixtures \u2013 when City host Liverpool and third-placed Tottenham take on West Bromwich Albion. In Monday\u2019s other matches, Chelsea eased the pressure on under-fire manager Andre Villas-Boas and claimed fourth place with a late 2-1 victory at Wolverhampton. Chelsea had gone four league matches without a win, but the London side went ahead nine minutes into the second half when Brazil midfielder Ramires fired home from Juan Mata\u2019s corner. Wolves looked to have salvaged a point with just six minutes remaining when Stephen Ward drove home a low shot. But the visitors claimed a vital victory in the 89th minute when veteran midfielder Frank Lampard converted England fullback Ashley Cole\u2019s cross from close range. Aston Villa beat Chelsea 3-1 on Saturday, but failed to make it back-to-back wins after a shock 2-0 home defeat by Premier League newcomers Swansea. The visitors took a fourth-minute lead through midfielder Nathan Dyer, and former Villa player Wayne Routledge sealed Swansea\u2019s first away victory early in the second half after striker Danny Graham\u2019s shot struck the post. Blackburn also failed to capitalize on a good win on Saturday, slumping to a 2-1 home defeat by Stoke just 48 hours after stunning Manchester United 3-2 at Old Trafford.   Peter Crouch opened the scoring for Stoke from close range, and the England striker doubled his tally on the stroke of halftime.  Scotland forward David Goodwillie pulled a goal back for the home side in the 69th minute, but the defeat left Blackburn second from bottom. Queens Park Rangers are now just one place above the relegation zone after losing 2-1 at home to Norwich. Captain Joey Barton drilled home Clint Hill\u2019s cross to give QPR an 11th-minute lead but the midfielder was then dismissed in the 36th minute after clashing with Bradley Johnson.

The Frenchman\u2019s second-round clash with Canada\u2019s Milos Raonic took three hours 58 minutes to complete, with the final set ending 25-23.  Tsonga drew first blood, comfortably taking the opening set 6-3. But Raonic, who is ranked 23rd in the world game, notched up the reverse score line in the second set and was increasingly looking like the man to beat.  Three match points came and went for the fifth seed before he finally found a volley at 40-15 in game 66 of the match,which was met with a desperate, failing lunge by Raonic.  It ensured the encounter beat the previous record of 48 games in one match between Chile\u2019s Fernando Gonzalez and American Taylor Dent in the Athens Olympics of 2004.  A men\u2019s match at the 1920 Olympics lasted 76 games, but that was played over five sets. It also claimed the record for the longest third set played at an Olympic match. Officials at Wimbledon have become used to rewriting the history books of late. The tennis venue was also the home of the longest game in all competitions when another Frenchman, Nicholas Mahut was beaten by American John Isner in a match lasting 183 games over three days in 2010. Tsonga admitted this was one of the rare chances he had to shine in the tough world of men\u2019s tennis.  \u201cIt\u2019s good because this is the only way to write my name in history for the moment. With Rafa, Roger and Novak, even Andy (Murray), it\u2019s tough to go through big tournaments. So I\u2019m really happy. I hope I will have some more,\u201d he told reporters. Meanwhile, Australian wildcard entry Lleyton Hewitt pulled off the shock result of the day in the second round.  The former world No. 1, now ranked 159th, beat Croatia\u2019s No. 13 Maran Cilic, 6-4 7-5 to set up a last-16 clash with Serbian second seed Novak Djokovic. Djokovic ensured there was no such giantkilling for veteran American Andy Roddick, beating his fellow former world No. 1 6-2 6-1.  British hopes in the competition remain in the hands of Wimbledon finalist Andy Murray, who beat 43rd-ranked Jarkko Niemenen from Finland 6-2 6-4. Third seed Murray will next face Cypriot Marcus Baghdatis, who beat French 16th seed Richard Gasquet 6-4 6-4. Spanish fourth seed David Ferrer also went through, and will play Japan\u2019s Kei Nishikori in round three. But no more Brits remain in the ladies\u2019 singles, as third seed Maria Sharapova edged closer to her first Olympic medal by overcoming Britain\u2019s former junior Wimbledon winner Laura Robson 7-6 (7-5) 6-3.  The English teenager admitted being outplayed by the French Open champion, but also had some less than kind words about the state of the hallowed turf on Center Court. \u201cAt 5-5 she (Sharapova) hit a serve that bounced a bit funny so I was already a bit gone with that one. Then I hit a pretty solid serve and her return just died. But it happens on grass courts, especially when they\u2019re really worn, like Center is at the moment,\u201d she told the UK Press Association news agency. Sharapova, who was the first woman to carry Russia\u2019s flag at the opening ceremony, faces a rematch with German 15th seed Sabine Lisicki \u2013 who beat her in the fourth round at Wimbledon. Heather Watson lost 6-3 6-2 to another Russian, 14th seed Maria Kirilenko, to complete a bad day for the women in Team GB. Kirilenko earned a third-round clash with Germany\u2019s Julia Gorges, who upset Poland\u2019s Wimbledon finalist Agnieszka Radwanska in the opening round. World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka strolled into round three with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of Spain\u2019s Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez, earning a match with Russia\u2019s Vera Zvonareva. Venus Williams joined younger sister Serena in the last 16 as the Sydney 2000 singles champion progressed with a  6-1 6-3 win over Canada\u2019s Aleksandra Wozniak.

I definitely felt like I was inspired by that on an Olympic level,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when I got the call in 2000 to be part of the Sydney Olympics 12 years ago, I got there, I stayed in the village. I was there for over two weeks. I had the best time following sports, being there with the athletes, playing so well.  I almost overachieved in that tournament.

The sixth seeds will next play Israel\u2019s Andy Ram and Jonathan Erlich ahead of a potential quarterfinal against the top-ranked Bryan brothers of the U.S. \u2013 who they beat in the Beijing semis. Former world No. 1 Novak Djokovic crashed out of the doubles competition as he and Serbian partner Viktor Troicki lost 7-6 (10-8) 6-3 to Sweden\u2019s Johan Brunstrom and Robert Lindstedt. However, their third-seeded compatriots Janko Tipsarevic and Nenad Zimonjic won their first-round match, beating Slovakia\u2019s Martin Klizan and Lukas Lacko 6-3 6-3. An Arab springboard for success Tipsarevic also progressed in the singles, coming from behind to beat Germany\u2019s Philipp Petzschner 3-6 6-3 6-4 as he set up a third-round clash with American 10th seed John Isner. Isner ended the hopes of Tunisia\u2019s Malek Jaziri, the only player from an Arab country in the men\u2019s draw. Argentine eighth seed Juan Martin del Potro will play France\u2019s No. 12 Gilles Simon in the last 16, while Spanish 11th seed Nicolas Almagro takes on 75th ranked Steve Darcis of Belgium \u2013 who upset former Wimbledon finalist Tomas Berdych in the first round. Former world No. 1 Andy Roddick set up a second-round clash with Djokovic, while Canada\u2019s Milos Raonic earned a meeting with French fifth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Australia\u2019s Lleyton Hewitt and Marcos Baghdatis battled into round two with three-set wins, while Argentine ninth seed Juan Monaco, Croatian No. 13 Marin Cilic, French No. 16 Richard Gasquet, Russia\u2019s Nikolay Davydenko and Spaniard Feliciano Lopez also went through."

        "content": "A Dutchman has built a replica of Noah\u2019s Ark to biblical proportions, following a dream his homeland would be flooded. Johan Huibers, a wealthy businessman, used the ancient measurement of the cubit \u2013 the length of a man\u2019s arm from elbow to fingertips \u2013 to build the vessel to the dimensions specified in the book of Genesis.  The finished craft \u2013 which has just been opened to the public on the Merwede River in the Dutch town of Dordrecht \u2013 is 300 cubits long (about 450 feet or 137 meters), 50 cubits wide (about 70 feet or 21 meters), and 30 cubits high (about 45 feet or 14 meters). Floods force evacuations in Costa Rica Huibers has filled his ark, which will operate as a \u201cBible museum,\u201d with life-sized plastic animals and an aviary of live birds to give visitors more to interact with. \u201cWe want to tell people about God,\u201d Huibers told AFP. \u201cWe wanted to build something that can help explain the Bible in real terms.\u201d It is not Huibers\u2019 first ark. He completed his first, a half-scale replica of Noah\u2019s Ark, in 2004, and used it to take tourists on canal trips, before beginning work on a full-scale version in 2008.  The origin of the project stems from a dream Huibers said he had in 1992, in which the low-lying Netherlands was flooded by the North Sea. More damage expected after floods in North Korea kill dozens \u201cThe next day I bought a book about Noah\u2019s Ark. That night while sitting on the couch with my kids, I looked at it and said: \u2018It\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do,\u2019\u201d he told AFP. \u201cI have always been a dreamer.\u201d He resolved to build the ark, to inspire children with the biblical story of how Noah and the inhabitants of his Ark survived the flood that, according to Old Testament, washed the world clean of sin. Despite his best efforts, it was impossible to adhere entirely to the biblical description of the Ark. Genesis describes Noah\u2019s boat as made of \u201cgopher wood,\u201d but experts disagree over what this is. Instead, Huibers and his team built the boat by welding together the metal hulls of 25 barges into a single frame, which was then covered with Scandinavian pine. Weighing about 3,000 tons, the boat contains sleeping quarters, a theater, restaurant and conference facilities to seat 1,500 people. Huibers initially wanted to sail his ark to London for the Olympics to share his message with sports fans. But he was forced to abandon his plan to sail across the North Sea after authorities raised safety issues. China doubles Beijing flood death toll "

Police announced the arrest without naming the suspect, while a source close to the newspaper\u2019s publisher, News International, confirmed it was Nick Parker.  The source asked not to be named discussing internal company business. Read more: Timeline of UK phone hacking scandal  The arrest is the latest in a long-running police investigation prompted by illegal eavesdropping at the defunct Murdoch tabloid The News of the World, which has expanded into probes of computer hacking, bribery and corruption. Parker was arrested earlier as part of the corruption investigation, the source close to News International said. He has not been charged. The first charges for phone hacking itself came last week, as prosecutors charged a former aide to British Prime Minister David Cameron and a close confidant of media baron Rupert Murdoch, along with six others. Cameron\u2019s former director of communications, Andy Coulson, and Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of Murdoch\u2019s News International, were charged Tuesday. The announced names of the suspected hacking victims include some of the world\u2019s biggest celebrities, including Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Paul McCartney, soccer star Wayne Rooney and actor Jude Law. Read more: Full CPS statement The phone-hacking accusations have reverberated through the top levels of British politics and journalism, led to the closing of a major tabloid and prompted a parliamentary committee to issue damning criticism of Murdoch. The charging announcement delivers one more public relations blow to Murdoch, who stepped down from a string of company boards of directors earlier this month and further distanced himself from the print business that first brought him fame and fortune. Coulson and Brooks are former editors of The News of the World, which was shut down last year in the face of public outrage at the hacking scandal.  Parent company News Corp.\u2019s multibillion-dollar bid to take over British Sky Broadcasting collapsed as the scandal spread. Brooks, who was charged with conspiracy to intercept voice mails of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, vigorously denied the charges, saying she was \u201cdistressed and angry.\u201d Coulson said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t and, more importantly, that I didn\u2019t, do anything to damage the Milly Dowler investigation.\u201d The scandal exploded with the revelation that the phone of Dowler, a 13-year-old British girl, was hacked after she disappeared in 2002. She was later found murdered. Indications that her voice mail had been accessed had given her parents the false hope she was still alive. Prosecutors allege there were more than 600 victims of phone hacking between 2000 and 2006.

The charge, which carries a potential seven-year sentence, stems from an unusual performance they gave in February. \u201cMother Mary please drive Putin away,\u201d the band screamed, their faces covered in neon masks, inside Moscow\u2019s Christ Savior Cathedral. The anonymous, feminist protest band called it a punk prayer. Three of the women were arrested soon after, and have been in custody ever since. Two of the women have young children.

Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 23, Maria Alyokhina, 24, and Yekaterina Samutsevich, 29, grinned at cameras as police brought them from a van into the court, waving their handcuffed arms behind their backs. They appeared in court in an enclosure that forced them to bend down to speak through small window to be heard. Amnesty International said Monday the trial \u201cnever should have taken place.\u201d John Dalhuisen of Amnesty said the singers had been making \u201ca legitimate protest \u2013 this is not a criminal offense. They must be released immediately.\u201d \u201cThey dared to attack the two pillars of modern Russian establishment \u2013 the Kremlin and the Orthodox Church. While many may have found their act offensive, the sentence of up to seven years in prison they may expect on the charges of hooliganism is wildly out of all proportion,\u201d he said. Pussy Riot member Tolokonnikova is bearing up well in jail, her husband, Peter Verzilov, told CNN earlier this  month. \u201cShe looks very good and she\u2019s taking it as she\u2019s supposed to take it \u2013 as very political and very artistic; as a very solid, creative and powerful person,\u201d he said, based on fleeting glimpses of  her in court. Pussy Riot specializes in sudden, often illegal public performances, including one in Moscow\u2019s Red Square. \u201cWe did realize that at some point, (they) could get arrested. That was always a possibility, but of course no one expected the arrest would come after this particular performance,\u201d Verzilov said. The punk prayer was inspired by the women\u2019s anger about the relationship between the Russian government and the Orthodox Church. The Orthodox leader Patriarch Kyril has been widely reported as saying Putin\u2019s years in power have been a miracle from God. But the band\u2019s behavior in one of Russia\u2019s most sacred cathedrals has outraged many of the country\u2019s faithful. \u201cThis is a disgusting thing to do,\u201d one woman told CNN. \u201cThey should go to jail,\u201d said another. \u201cA year or two. Let them to think about their behavior.\u201d But even some of those who were offended believe the women should not be in jail. \u201cIf necessary, God will punish them,\u201d said one man. \u201cIt must be not be cruel punishment.\u201d The women also have passionate supporters who say they are victims of political persecution. Verzilov says he has told his 4-year-old daughter who\u2019s to blame. \u201cGerra knows that Putin has put Nadia in prison and he\u2019s not letting her out. We have to find a way to defeat him to free Nadia,\u201d he said. The Russian president hasn\u2019t commented on the case. Pussy Riot is only one small part of the recent anti-Putin protest movement. But the decision to jail and prosecute these women has ensured that the band\u2019s colorful face masks have become one of the opposition\u2019s most powerful symbols."

Scotland Yard sent a team of detectives to the site to search for the missing set, but despite determining that they had not been stolen, officers were unable to find them.

With 97% of of the votes counted, officials said just over 46% of registered voters had cast ballots, short of the majority of registered voters needed for the vote to be valid.  Those who did cast ballots voted nearly 9 to 1 to impeach the president, the Central Election Bureau said. Basescu had urged his supporters to boycott the polls, saying, \u201cThe best help today is to stay home.\u201d  After the polls closed at 11 p.m. (4 p.m. ET), he said voters had rejected a \u201ccoup\u201d by Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the interim president, Crin Antonescu. Asked if he was certain about the figures, he told them, \u201cI\u2019m never wrong.\u201d  Exit polls Sunday had shown that the overwhelming majority of those voting favored Basescu\u2019s impeachment.  That led Ponta to say Basescu \u201cshould strongly consider whether he is still legitimate or not in the office.\u201d  \u201cI believe that any politician that says he can ignore the voice of almost 9 million people is totally unrealistic,\u201d Ponta said.  Ponta\u2019s Social Liberal Union (USL) disputed the turnout figures, saying it had estimated 9.2 million people had voted \u2013 slightly over 50% \u2013 which would mean Basescu would be ousted.  Final results are expected later on Monday.  Basescu has been suspended since the USL-led parliament voted to impeach him in early July, saying he overstepped his authority by ordering wage and benefit cuts for public workers.  Basescu said the measures were needed to meet the terms of a $24 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund for the cash-strapped country, but the move soured many Romanians on his leadership.  Romanian president suspended Opponents also accuse Basescu of cronyism. He took office eight years ago and has already survived one effort to remove him, in 2007.  The latest crisis in the southeastern European nation \u2013 slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Oregon \u2013 has sent its currency, the leu, plummeting to record lows.  Romanian president faces impeachment Two pro-Basescu governments have collapsed, paving the way for Ponta\u2019s center-left USL to take office. Ponta succeeded in getting lawmakers to not only suspend Basescu, but to remove both speakers of parliament and replace them with allies.  In voting Sunday, Ponta expressed anger that the prime minister of neighboring Hungary, Viktor Orban, had urged Romania\u2019s ethnic Hungarian minority not to vote.  \u201cI want Romanians to decide their own fate,\u201d Ponta said.  Ponta is dealing with his own controversy: He has been accused of plagiarizing his doctoral thesis. He has dismissed the accusation as a political attack from Basescu."

Hamilton\u2019s teammate Jenson Button finished sixth ahead of Bruno Senna of Brazil in the Williams. Mark Webber in the second Red Bull, Ferrari\u2019s Felipe Massa and Nico Rosberg for Mercedes completed the points scoring. Alonso has a 40 point lead in the championship standings with Vettel two points further adrift in third and Hamilton in fourth. Hamilton led the championship before a recent poor run, but after the mid-season break will clearly be a force in an improved McLaren with nine of the 20 races to go. \u201cI am looking forward to the continuation of the championship. A long way to go and a lot of work to do but we have shown we can compete. It is very, very close but we are going to give it all we can,\u201d he told the post-race media conference. It was the 19th win of his 101-race F1 career and it only came under threat towards the finish as he held off Raikkonen on worn tires. Raikkonen was unhappy that his car\u2019s kinetic  energy recovery system (Kers) was faulty. \u201cWe came second, it\u2019s not enough, but we had some problems with the Kers,\u201d said the former world champion. \u201cWe had some speed and we\u2019ll try to win the next race. At least we are up there all the time and we put ourselves in a good position but we are not happy  until we win.\u201d Seven-time champion Michael Schumacher endured a miserable afternoon, with his Mercedes having to start from the pit lane after its engine cut out on the grid. He was late given a penalty for speeding in the pit lane and came home 24th and last.     "

        "content": "These are tumultuous times for Tunisian tennis player Malek Jaziri. The 28-year-old might be the only player from an Arab country in the men\u2019s draw at the Olympics, but his first-round win over Yen-Hsun Lu 7-6, 4-6. 6-3 has once more showcased the  Tunisian\u2019s remarkable powers of perseverance in the face of injury and political turmoil in his homeland. Professionally Jaziri has never looked back since the Tunisian revolution, which sparked the region\u2019s Arab Spring and toppled the regime of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali.. At the start of the revolution Jaziri was ranked 342nd; by the end of 2011 he was up to 150th; and now, following this week\u2019s release of the latest rankings, the Tunisian has climbed to 67th after recording his first win at Wimbledon. \u201cI decided to come back from living in Barcelona to practise,\u201d Jaziri told CNN, as he recalled the events that led to Ben Ali\u2019s fall. \u201cThe weather is always good and I was close to my family \u2013 then one week after I got back, the revolution happened. It wasn\u2019t easy, but it made me feel better, and my ranking got better. \u201cAt first it was very hard to practize and to travel to play. The airport was closed, there were helicopters and shooting. But now it\u2019s safe, everyone is feeling good. I\u2019m an ambassador for Tunisia and it is my source de l\u2019inspiration. We have history, the desert, the sea, it\u2019s like a paradise, really.\u201d Docteur, Docteur Jaziri\u2019s rise up the rankings is even more remarkable given he missed two years through injury at the age of 22 \u2013 a time when most players are establishing themselves professionally. \u201cA few years ago when I was young, I  was very promising, going very well, 200th in the rankings, being put forward for Grand Slams, and then I had an accident. I injured my knee and I couldn\u2019t play. \u201cI spent the first year here in Tunisia with my family, but my knee wasn\u2019t doing so well.  I told my family that I would take one last chance going to Europe. I went there, saw a French doctor, and after nine months I was running again. It was a very, very tough time for me though.\u201d But a spate of injuries \u2013 he also hurt his ankle and wrist \u2013 badly affected Jaziri\u2019s confidence. \u201cIt\u2019s true, I didn\u2019t get given much of a chance with injuries \u2013 it was not easy for me. With my knee, I was sat at home unable to do anything. I said I would quit and work with my father in the family business. But then I took my last chance in Paris\u2026and thank God for that.\u201d It is not just the intervention of a Parisian doctor that provides fond memories of the French capital for Jaziri, who was born in the Tunisian city of Bizerte. \u201cDuring the war Roland Garros crashed his plane in Bizerte, the town where I play,\u201d said Jaziri, referring to the renowned French pilot, who was a keen tennis player and whom the stadium that hosts the French Open was named after. \u201cThey made a monument here for him. Eighty per cent of clubs in Tunisia have clay courts and everyone watches Roland Garros. So far I\u2019ve played two Grand Slams, and in Roland Garros I won the first round, I\u2019m very happy.\u201d Carrying the hopes of a nation As well as his recent Grand Slam achievements, Jaziri is making the most of his Olympic experience, particularly given he needed a wildcard to enter the tournament. \u201cI had just finished my first match at Wimbledon when they told me that I had made the main draw in the Olympics. To win my first match at Wimbledon and then to have the chance to play at the Olympics was fantastic, I was twice as happy.\u201d \u201cI thank the ITF for giving me the wildcard to play at the Olympic Games, it\u2019s very important for me. I\u2019m very proud to play for my country, for Tunisia, and I hope to do good things. Why Federer\u2019s friend is flying the Swiss flag at London \u201cIt\u2019s a very tough sensation to explain, when you hear the anthem of your country from on the podium. And I\u2019m not just representing my country at the games but also all African and Arabic countries \u2013 I can feel their support, it\u2019s like a dream for me.\u201d Going solo It\u2019s not just revolution and injury that Jaziri has had to overcome. Earlier in his career he was even having to book his own hotels and train tickets as well as having to apply to enter tournaments. \u201cAt first I didn\u2019t have the chance to get a coach or staff. In the beginning it was tough, travelling alone, but then it becomes like a habit \u2013 you\u2019re always alone so you learn to take responsibility. I had to do everything myself. It\u2019s a lot of small things, but it takes up a lot of time.\u201d But his new-found success has brought sponsorship and that has enabled Jaziri to hire a coach and a fitness trainer, which perhaps explains his progression up the tennis ladder. \u201cI\u2019m the new ambassador of tourism for Tunisia, the Minister of Tourism sponsors me,\u201d added Jaziri. \u201cI would welcome everyone to Tunisia, it can be a second home to anyone. We have freedom and safety now. It will be very nice to promote Tunisia all around the world. The Olympics is a dream for everyone, and I will be a part of it.\u201d"

Grosjean\u2019s teammate Kimi Raikkonen took fifth, ahead of the two Ferrari drivers Alonso and Felipe Massa. Australian Mark Webber, who currently sits second in the championship after wins at Monaco and Silverstone, had a miserable day amd will start eleventh on the grid.

Mercedes drivers Michael Schumacher and Nico Rosberg also endured a less than satisfactory qualifying session, with Rosberg qualifying in 13th and Schumacher, a seven-time world champion, only managing 17th. \u201cIt was quite a tough and difficult day for us,\u201d said Schumacher. \u201cWe have to clearly see that we did not have the pace to be in the front.\u201d \u201cYou have to accept the gap is quite big.

        "content": "Embattled Romanian President Traian Basescu declared victory late Sunday after low voter turnout appeared to doom a referendum on whether to remove him from office.  The Central Electoral Bureau estimated turnout at 45.9%, short of the majority of registered voters needed for the vote to be valid. Basescu had urged his supporters to boycott the polls, telling reporters, \u201cThe best help today is to stay home.\u201d  After the polls closed at 11 p.m. (4 p.m. ET), he said voters had rejected a \u201ccoup\u201d by Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the interim president, Crin Antonescu. Asked if he was certain about the figures, he told them, \u201cI\u2019m never wrong.\u201d  Election officials\u2019 estimate was based on a survey of nearly 3,000 polling stations across the country, about 6% of the precincts. They estimated their sampling error at about 3 percentage points.  Exit polls from Romanian television stations indicated turnout was about 44% late Sunday, and that the overwhelming majority of those voting favored Basescu\u2019s impeachment. That led Ponta to say Basescu \u201cshould strongly consider whether he is still legitimate or not in the office.\u201d  \u201cI believe that any politician that says he can ignore the voice of almost 9 million people is totally unrealistic,\u201d Ponta said.  Ponta\u2019s Social Liberal Union (USL) disputed the turnout figures, saying it had estimated 9.2 million people had voted \u2013 slightly over 50% \u2013 which would mean Basescu would be ousted. Final results are expected Monday.  Basescu has been suspended since the USL-led parliament voted to impeach him in early July, saying he overstepped his authority by ordering wage and benefit cuts for public workers. Basescu said the measures were needed to meet the terms of a $24 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund for the cash-strapped country, but the move soured many Romanians on his leadership.  Romanian president suspended Opponents also accuse Basescu of cronyism. He took office eight years ago and has already survived one effort to remove him, in 2007.  The latest crisis in the southeastern European nation \u2013 slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Oregon \u2013 has sent its currency, the leu, plummeting to record lows.  Romanian president faces impeachment Two pro-Basescu governments have collapsed, paving the way for Ponta\u2019s center-left USL to take office. Ponta succeeded in getting lawmakers to not only suspend Basescu, but to remove both speakers of parliament and replace them with allies.  In voting Sunday, Ponta expressed anger that the prime minister of neighboring Hungary, Viktor Orban, had urged Romania\u2019s ethnic Hungarian minority not to vote.  \u201cI want Romanians to decide their own fate,\u201d Ponta said.  Ponta is dealing with his own controversy: He has been accused of plagiarizing his doctoral thesis. He has dismissed the accusation as a political attack from Basescu."

Fellow American and 2005 winner Paula Creamer and another South Korean, Park Inbee, were three shots adrift on nine under at the joint LPGA and Ladies European Tour event.

Lewis shot a course record 63 in the first round and an eagle three on the long seventh left her three under for the day.

In this weather, you have to make  birdies. But it is hard not to push too much.\u201d     Boosted by four birdies in a row from the 13th, Lee carded a 67 to challenge the leader.

        "content": "He\u2019s brought bloodthirsty zombies, squalid junkies and murderous housemates to life on the big screen, but faced the toughest task of his career at London 2012: bringing boogying nurses, bucolic scenes and butterflies on bicycles to a worldwide audience of a billion people. Danny Boyle, the Oscar-winning director \u2013 and east London resident \u2013 best known for hit movies \u201cTrainspotting\u201d and \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d was the man responsible for the Olympic opening ceremony, the show that televisions around the world were tuned in to at the start of London\u2019s long-awaited Games. And while those of his films set in Britain have painted a darkly comic picture of the country, \u201cIsles of Wonder\u201d \u2013 the \u201cTempest\u201d-inspired extravaganza which kicked off the Games \u2013 proved much more of a celebration of the nation. Live blog: Let the games begin A billion people across the globe tuned in for the three-hour, $42.4m show, which featured 10,000 adult volunteers, 900 children, 12 horses, 10 chickens, nine geese, three cows and a flock of sheep. With an uplifting, \u201cpeople power\u201d theme combining references to British history and pop culture, the rambunctious ceremony covered subjects as diverse as the Industrial Revolution, the National Health Service, popular children\u2019s book characters including Peter Pan and Mary Poppins, and pop stars past and present.  It was well received in the United Kingdom and abroad, drawing an average audience of 40.7 million people in the US, topping the previous record of 39.8 million for the 1996 Atlanta Games. \u201cThe Ceremony is an attempt to capture a picture of ourselves as a nation, where we have come from and where we want to be,\u201d Boyle explained in a statement in the run-up to the Games, saying he hoped to tell the country\u2019s story, with the help of a vast army of volunteers who, he said, \u201care the purest embodiment of the Olympic spirit and represent the best of who we are as a nation.\u201d \u201cWe have to celebrate all that is great about the past but also all the potential Britain has in the future,\u201d said British Prime Minister David Cameron.  \u201cThe difficulty is how do you cram in all that is great about our country, whether it is sport, art, literature, history, contribution to world events. I\u2019m confident they have done a good job and there were one or two moments I was really moved by. There\u2019s something for everyone.\u201d Opinion: Is Team USA\u2019s militaristic uniform a problem? Britons are known for their ability to laugh at themselves, and it appears Boyle sought to capitalize on this \u2013 as The Economist noted recently, \u201copening ceremonies are a country\u2019s opportunity to sell itself to the world. Britain appears to be selling irony.\u201d Olympics organizers say that Boyle\u2019s experience, energy and unusual vision made him the perfect man for the job. \u201cHis ability as a storyteller, as a creator of spectacle, his background in both theater and film and the passion he has for this city and this project \u2013 they all just screamed at us,\u201d said Bill Morris, director of Ceremonies for the London Games, when Boyle was appointed to the role. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a difficult choice.\u201d \u201cDanny gets this,\u201d London 2012 Chairman Sebastian Coe told CNN back in 2010. \u201cHe gets the Olympic Games, he gets sports, he lives in London, he\u2019s a stone\u2019s throw from the Olympic Park, and it was just such an obvious fit.\u201d It was not always thus: Boyle, 55, was born into a working-class family in Manchester, northern England, the son of a power plant worker and a cafeteria employee, and as a child had hoped to become a Catholic priest. But after a school trip to see a much-lauded Royal Shakespeare Company performance of \u201cRichard II,\u201d and a visit to the cinema with classmates to see Stanley Kubrick\u2019s controversial \u201cA Clockwork Orange,\u201d his ambitions turned instead to film and theater. Boyle studied English and drama at university, before working at the RSC and at London\u2019s innovative Royal Court Theatre, where he was deputy director in the 1980s.  He moved into television, and then on to movies, making his big screen debut with \u201cShallow Grave,\u201d the darkly humorous tale of three flatmates who discover a suitcase full of cash when their new lodger dies of a drug overdose. Despite being made on a shoestring budget \u2013 Boyle is reported to have said the team behind it were forced to sell off furniture to buy film stock when the $1.55m budget began to run short \u2013 \u201cShallow Grave\u201d became Britain\u2019s biggest grossing film of 1995, earning $20m worldwide, as well as a string of positive reviews. He followed it up with \u201cTrainspotting\u201d (1996) the critically-acclaimed story of a group of Edinburgh heroin addicts, which launched the careers of Ewan McGregor, Kelly Macdonald (\u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d) and Kevin McKidd (\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d), and was hailed by Rolling Stone magazine as \u201ca visionary knockout spiked with insight, wild invention and outrageous wit.\u201d  London welcomes world for Olympics opening ceremony Its success \u2013 the movie, which had cost just $2m to make, earned $72m \u2013 prompted a move towards Hollywood, but Boyle\u2019s career faltered with his first two big-budget projects, \u201cA Life Less Ordinary,\u201d and \u201cThe Beach,\u201d and he briefly returned to television in the UK, before making his movie comeback with 2002\u2019s post-apocalyptic zombie flick \u201c28 Days Later.\u201d He then changed tone, directing the more family-orientated family feature \u201cMillions,\u201d (2004) about two brothers who find a stash of pound notes only days before the UK is set to switch its currency to the euro. Five years later, he scooped the Oscar for Best Director when \u201cSlumdog Millionaire,\u201d the story of a poor Indian teenager who wins a TV gameshow, swept the board at the 2009 Academy Awards. And it is the uplifting, life-affirming mood of \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d that the director brought to the opening ceremony, because despite the dark subject matter of many of his films, and his recent return to theater with a rapturously-received production of Frankenstein, Boyle insists he remains positive, an optimist. Speaking in 2010, he said: \u201cI want it to feel like a very genuine expression of the welcome to the athletes and to the Games of the city, and especially from east London.\u201d As the athletes launch into competition in venues around his home, his ceremony\u2019s combination of novelty, national pride and nuttiness seems to have accomplished exactly that.

        "content": "Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo has warned his team not to get carried away by this season\u2019s remarkable turnaround in form. Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso will take a 34-point lead over Red Bull\u2019s Mark Webber into Sunday\u2019s Hungarian Grand Prix despite having almost written off the Scuderia\u2019s title chances in preseason. After early misgivings over the 2012 car, the Spaniard now has three successes from 10 starts \u2013 two of them in the last three grands prix. Webber, with two victories, is the only other driver to have topped the podium more than once. Alonso\u2019s teammate Felipe Massa is back in 14th overall with only 23 points, meaning second-placed Ferrari trail Red Bull by 53 points in the manufacturers\u2019 standings after last Sunday\u2019s race in Germany. \u201cI am concerned, more so than the day after Valencia (when Alonso won his second race of 2012),\u201d Montezemolo said on the Ferarri website ahead of the final race before Formula One\u2019s month-long break.  Latest Formula One standings \u201cI see very strong opponents: McLaren has made great progress, Red Bull is very strong, Sauber had a race pace that was a match for ours and Lotus is very strong at times.  \u201cTherefore, we have to be very careful. After we had a difficult start to the season, maybe our rivals did not expect to see Ferrari capable of fighting back this strongly, but now they will redouble their efforts to beat us. Therefore, we must stay very focused and continue our efforts to improve continuously.\u201d Alonso was third at the Hungaroring last year as Jenson Button gave McLaren a fifth victory in seven years at the circuit, which is one of the slowest on the F1 calendar. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tight again. It\u2019s a very short circuit, and as we saw this year, in two- or three-tenths there are eight, nine cars,\u201d Alonso said on the F1 website.  \u201cIn Hungary we need to make a perfect preparation again, a perfect qualifying, because you can be starting in 12th or 13th if you make a little mistake, so we need to approach the race in the same way we did the last couple, try to maximize what we have in Hungary and hopefully bring in some new parts that can help us. McLaren chief: F1 teams must unite \u201cAt the moment our car seems okay in all areas, there are not weak points, as maybe we had at the beginning of the season when we were suffering a little bit on traction and top speed. Now I think that we are okay on that.  \u201cIn Hungary with these slow-speed corners, I don\u2019t see any problem with the car. We should be competitive there.\u201d Button returned to form with second place at  Hockenheim, and McLaren hope that last weekend\u2019s upgrades will make the team even more competitive at a track where Lewis Hamilton won in 2007 and 2009 \u2013 and former drivers Kimi Raikkonen (2005) and Heikki Kovalainen (2008) also triumphed. \u201cThe race pace certainly enabled Jenson to stay in touch with the Red Bull and Ferraris,\u201d said managing director Jonathan Neale.  \u201cSo on that day, on that circuit, in those conditions we were there or thereabouts. I don\u2019t think that we are dominant and we need to continue to work very hard. But we\u2019re pleased with it.\u201d Button also won in Budapest for Honda in 2006 for the first victory of his career, after Raikkonen took pole position for McLaren. \u201c(Last year) I celebrated my 200th grand prix there on the Saturday evening with some of my oldest friends and colleagues in the paddock and I went on to win on Sunday. It was the perfect weekend,\u201d the Englishman recalled. \u201cThere\u2019s every reason to believe we can get another good result this year. Our pace at Hockenheim gives us cause for encouragement \u2013 it\u2019s just that, as always, we\u2019ll need to run flawlessly through qualifying and the race if we\u2019re to be in the hunt at the end.\u201d De Villota discharged from UK hospital  Red Bull\u2019s two-time defending world champion Sebastian Vettel was second in Hungary last year, and is aiming to bounce back from last weekend\u2019s disappointment at Hockenheim when he was demoted to fifth for an illegal late overtaking move on Button. However, the UK-based Austrian team will need to make adjustments after ruling body the FIA deemed Red Bull\u2019s engine mapping to change the aerodynamics of the cars and therefore be illegal. \u201cThe track is one of the slowest on the calendar, but as a driver you shouldn\u2019t underestimate it as there are a lot of opportunities to make mistakes,\u201d the German said.  \u201cIt can be very hot and that means the track can be very demanding physically. In addition, the surface has many bumps which shake you around a lot.\u201d Rain is forecast for Friday\u2019s practice sessions, but the weather should be hot and sunny for qualifying on Saturday and the race on Sunday. \u201cA twisty and slippery circuit will often put more heat through the tire than a fast and flowing layout as the tire is moving around more \u2013 particularly when the ambient temperatures are high,\u201d said Paul Hembery, managing director of F1\u2019s sole supplier Pirelli.  \u201cHaving said that, in Hungary last year we saw some wet weather, so it\u2019s important not to make any assumptions. Consequently, we are still lacking some information about the performance of our slick tires under race conditions at the Hungaroring.\u201d Meanwhile, Marussia test driver Maria de Villota has left hospital in her native Spain and will return home to recover from the crash in Britain that cost her an eye. \u201cThe patient\u2019s general conditions are good, which allowed us to release her,\u201d her website reported on Thursday. \u201cIn the last six days, she has been treated by specialists of the plastic and neurological surgery services, and the ophthalmology department, who will continue to follow her as she will need to undergo periodical checks and treatments. \u201cFrom a neurological point of view, the patient does not present any deficit and does not need any surgery.\u201d De Villota, one of two women contracted to an F1 team this year, collided with a stationary support truck after completing her first lap at her first test outing for the UK-based Russian marque."

        "content": "Celebrity comedians were among hundreds who on Friday welcomed a UK court ruling that cleared a man of sending a tweet joking about blowing up an airport. The case has highlighted the arguments for and against the limits of free speech on the internet. Paul Chambers was originally fined \u00a3385 ($603) and ordered to pay thousands in court costs after being found guilty in 2010 of sending a \u201cmenacing tweet\u201d that read: \u201cCrap! Robin Hood Airport is closed. You\u2019ve got a week and a bit to get your s\u2014 together, otherwise I\u2019m blowing the airport sky high.\u201d He claimed it was a joke and sent it during a moment of frustration while the airport in the north of England was closed by snow. The original trial heard that the tweet was discovered when an airport manager, who was not a Twitter member, searched for \u201cRobin Hood Airport\u201d on the social networking site. Thousands of people joined an online campaign to support Chambers, retweeting his message, and recently posting Twitter comments under the hashtag #twitterjoketrial.  The high-profile British actor, broadcaster and prolific tweeter, Stephen Fry, said Friday: \u201cComplete vindication and victory for Paul Chambers in #twitterjoketrial. Well done @DavidAllenGreen and team.\u201d In its ruling, the court said: \u201cThe appeal against conviction will be allowed on the basis that this \u2018tweet\u2019 did not constitute or include a message of a menacing character. \u201cIt was treated and addressed as if it was not a credible threat. The airport police took no action.\u201d  The verdict prompted a grateful response from Chambers who said to his Twitter followers: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done this without you, we wouldn\u2019t have got close.\u201d British comedian Frankie Boyle tweeted: \u201c#twitterjoketrial means comedians will feel more secure tweeting jokes and people making threats will try work in some humour. It\u2019s Win-Win.\u201d  Another British actor and comic, Ricky Gervais, who has notched up major TV successes on both sides of the Atlantic, was more provocative in his reaction, tweeting: \u201cOriginal Judge in The Paul Chambers twitter joke trial admits he was only joking when he convicted Paul.\u201d  Ben Goldacre, a prominent author and scientist, added: \u201cHe may have got off, but after years of angst and expense #twitterjoketrial is a disappointing stain on the credibility of the UK judiciary.\u201d Defense solicitor in the case, David Allen Greene, was equally scathing in his reaction, tweeting: \u201cThis shameful prosecution should never have been brought. The DPP [Director of Public Prosecutions] made the personal decision to oppose the appeal. Disgraceful.\u201d The hashtags  #Paul Chambers and #twitterjoketrial were both trending in the UK Friday, but if anyone was opposed to the verdict they were not immediately visible on the social networking site. In contrast, hundreds of tweets supported the court decision, with one poster calling himself The Sev, summing up the sentiments of many of them: \u201cToday the courts ruled you\u2019re allowed to make jokes on Twitter.\u201d"

        "content": "Some of the world\u2019s top tennis stars will have the honor of carrying their countries\u2019 flags at Friday\u2019s opening ceremony for the London 2012 Olympics, but one of the sport\u2019s biggest names is taking a back seat. Not due to injury, like Beijing 2008 singles champion Rafael Nadal \u2013 who has had to relinquish his role as Spain\u2019s flag bearer \u2013 but because one of the game\u2019s renowned gentlemen thinks it\u2019s time to share the prestigious job. While former world No. 1s Novak Djokovic and Maria Sharapova will lead the way for Serbia and Russia, Switzerland\u2019s team will be led into the Olympic stadium by a gold medalist, and one of the European nation\u2019s finest tennis players \u2013 though he\u2019s not the one that you\u2019d expect to see in the limelight. Stanislas Wawrinka has spent his career in the shadow of Roger Federer, but on Friday the eyes of the world will be on the man known as \u201cStan\u201d \u2013 and not his great friend. Russian Olympic first for Sharapova World No. 1 Federer, the most successful men\u2019s tennis player of any era, declined the chance to carry the Swiss flag for the third time. \u201cI just felt it was important to give someone else a chance. In Switzerland we believe that,\u201d the 30-year-old said. \u201cI told the Swiss Olympic Committee that they should choose someone else and they chose my partner, Stan Wawrinka. It\u2019s a great, great honor for him. I couldn\u2019t have won the gold without him, everybody knows that. I think they chose the right guy.\u201d A tale of two careers Wawrinka has won three tournament titles to Federer\u2019s 75, and $5.5 million in prize money to the 16-time grand slam champion\u2019s $73 million, but they have one thing in common: an Olympic gold medal. Four years ago in Beijing, seeded only fourth, the Swiss duo overcame the odds to win the men\u2019s doubles competition \u2013 cementing a partnership that began when they started practicing together in the late 1990s. Wawrinka, nearly four years Federer\u2019s junior, was just 16 at the time. \u201cHe was already number six in the world \u2013 after 10 minutes I was completely red!\u201d Wawrinka told CNN\u2019s Open Court of his first session with Federer. \u201cI was dead tired, and so nervous to play with him. \u201cHe\u2019s the best, it\u2019s good for any player. We\u2019ll be practicing one week and then playing each other the next, but it\u2019s not the fact that we share nationalities that makes playing him hard, it\u2019s that he\u2019s the best in the world.\u201d American idol Wawrinka, like Federer, idolized seven-time Wimbledon winner Pete Sampras when he was growing up.  \u201cI wasn\u2019t good until I was 17 \u2013 I never even won the Swiss Championship,\u201d the 2003 French Open boys\u2019 champion said. \u201cSampras was a great athlete and I was a big fan. That\u2019s why I focus on being an allrounder.\u201d Federer matched Sampras\u2019 record tally at the All England Club when he beat Andy Murray in this month\u2019s final, and Wawrinka will face Britain\u2019s world No. 4 in the opening round of the Olympic singles competition. Despite slipping down the world rankings from a career high of ninth in 2009 to 25th ahead of London 2012, Wawrinka still holds hopes of success. \u201cI feel I\u2019m playing the best tennis of my career right now \u2013 the top 40 is just so strong, the strongest it\u2019s ever been, maybe. With this top 40 you have to fight for every match. To break back into it is more mental than physical, for sure. It\u2019s about confidence,\u201d he said \u201cSometimes I put too much pressure on myself. It\u2019s not good. I\u2019m too tight, because I want to win. That\u2019s why I need to focus on what\u2019s going on on the court, not off of it.\u201d Family ties His drop in form coincided with the birth of his first child, daughter Alexia, in 2010, while last year he separated from his wife Ilham Vuilloud.  \u201cHaving a daughter and being a tennis pro changes everything. It\u2019s hard to train so much, but it\u2019s great to see she\u2019s interested in what I\u2019m doing \u2013 if I\u2019m playing tennis, she wants to play tennis,\u201d he said. Wawrinka fondly recalls Beijing, where he and Federer beat top-ranked doubles duo Mike and Bob Bryan in the semifinals before winning gold. \u201cWe played our best tennis against the Bryan brothers \u2013 it was the toughest and most important win. Whilst we talked strategy for the finals afterwards, it was made easier knowing we were playing great tennis,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the first game I wasn\u2019t playing well, but Roger really helped me to be comfortable. We\u2019ve known each other for so long, but even we were surprised at how easy we found it on the court. It was so natural, and talking helped a lot \u2013 we\u2019re very honest around the court.\u201d Their close relationship translated well off the court too, particularly in the Olympic Village. \u201cAt night all of the Swiss athletes would play cards. We played a lot against the soccer team \u2013 we were the best though, you can ask them!\u201d Togther for life If Federer\u2019s inclusion for China was a foregone conclusion, Wawrinka\u2019s presence was anything but guaranteed. \u201cRoger had a lot of great players to choose from (as a partner). It was a tough choice but in the end he chose me. We were having a great time and I think that\u2019s part of the reason we won \u2013 I was happy for him and he was happy for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI was almost crying at the medal ceremony. We had to joke around to stop the tears and start laughing instead. We used our friendship to stop from crying in front of everybody! \u201cIt was the best moment of my career because it wasn\u2019t just about tennis. It was about sport, it was about Switzerland, it\u2019s a dream for everyone and to share it with someone added to the enjoyment.\u201d Federer will go into London 2012 seeking the one major title that eludes him \u2013 Olympic gold in the singles. He begins his campaign against Colombia\u2019s Alejandro Falla, the man who took him to five sets at Wimbledon in 2010. Federer reached the semifinals as a teenager at Sydney 2000 but lost in the playoff for the bronze, then crashed out in the second round in Athens and the last eight in Beijing. \u201cThe day before the (doubles) quarterfinals Roger lost to James Blake in the singles and I had to prove to him that he could trust me,\u201d Wawrinka said.  \u201cOnce we started playing well I could tell he got over the loss and said to himself, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s do something in the doubles now.\u2019 That was the moment, and now we have a gold medal \u2013 together, for life.\u201d"

        "content": "Chelsea captain John Terry was charged by the English Football Association (FA) Friday over his verbal clash with Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand during a Premier League match last year. Terry was cleared by a London court last month of racially abusing Ferdinand in the incident, but the FA has decided to take its own action after seeking independent legal advice. \u201cIt is alleged that Terry used abusive and/or insulting words and/or behavior towards Queens Park Rangers\u2019 Anton Ferdinand, contrary to FA rules,\u201d read an FA statement.  \u201cIt is further alleged that this included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or color and/or race of Anton Ferdinand.  \u201cThis charge is the result of The FA\u2019s long-standing enquiries into this matter, which were placed on hold pending the outcome of the criminal trial, and relates to rules governing football only. \u201c Terry said Friday that he denied the charges and would be requesting a personal hearing.  He was found not guilty after a five-day trial at Westminster  Magistrates Court which went into precise detail about the circumstances of the disagreement between the two players during the televised match on October 23 last year. Terry was stripped of the England captaincy in February over the allegations, leading to the subsequent resignation of national team manager Fabio Capello, just months before Euro 2012. Terry played in the finals under new manager Roy Hodgson while awaiting his criminal trial. Meanwhile, Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri was given a three-match international ban by the French Football Federation over his behavior at Euro 2012. Nasri mouthed an obscenity to a television camera after scoring France\u2019s equalizer in the 1-1 draw against England in the group stages.  He also insulted a journalist after France lost in the quarterfinals to Spain. He will miss World Cup qualifiers against Finland and  Belarus in September, but will be available for a rematch against Spain in October.

The 21-year-old is currently on international duty with Brazil at the London Olympics and has joined the English Premier League club on a five-year deal. Oscar, who has been compared to compatriot Kaka, came through the youth system at Sao Paulo and was part of the Brazil side that won the Under-17 World Championships in 2008. He moved to Internacional in 2010 and made his debut for the national side in September 2011, having represented his country at every level from Under-15 upwards. Oscar\u2019s first international goal came in a 4-3 friendly defeat to South American rivals Argentina, played in the United States last month. He is the third high profile signing of the close season by Chelsea, who secured their first ever European Champions League triumph last season. Belgium international Eden Hazard joined the London club from French side Lille for a reported fee of $49 million, while Marko Marin was also signed from German side Werder Bremen.

And to reflect the growing trend of footballers waxing lyrical on the micro-blogging site \u2013 and occasionally overstepping the mark \u2013 the English Premier League has now released their first ever set of guidelines on the subject. Only this week Chelsea and England defender Ashley Cole caused a storm when he joined Twitter and responded to the barbs from fans of his former club Arsenal by mocking them as to how many trophies he had won since leaving. And on Tuesday the English Football Association charged Arsenal\u2019s Emmanuel Frimpong for bringing the game into disrepute for something he posted on Twitter. The Premier League were quick to trumpet the benefits of having their stellar names on social media sites, like Twitter and Facebook, as it allows for interaction with numerous fans, but stressed it must be used responsibly. \u201cSocial media is doing a good job of allowing fans to feel closer to the players,\u201d Premier League chairman Richard Scudamore was quoted as saying on their official website.  \u201cThere is a more human side now to some of the players and the public can communicate more directly with them. \u201cClearly it isn\u2019t the same as texting your best mate or talking to someone in person and sometimes there can be abusive comments, but generally the internet, online chat rooms, and the way people are communicating is healthy.\u201d According to the Premier League, their Facebook page and that of the 20 clubs in England\u2019s top division have attracted an aggregate of 60 million \u2018likes.\u2019 The figures underline the increasing importance of social media in sport, and the changing way in which people consume the action presented to them. More and more fans are not only watching the matches they attend, but filming them on mobile phones and uploading them to Twitter, Facebook or YouTube. \u201cThe pleasure of sport lies not so much in witnessing an event as talking about it,\u201d Ellis Cashmore, professor of Culture, Media and Sport at England\u2019s Staffordshire University, told CNN recently. \u201cWe\u2019ve all at some point sat at home and watched a fight or a tennis match in isolation and it\u2019s never as enjoyable as when we are in company, talking about the competition as it unfolds.  \u201cMobile phones have opened out the possibilities. We can talk to anyone, anywhere while the action is taking place.\u201d This new trend will be emphasized by the upcoming Olympics, with the number of users on Facebook having risen to 900 million \u2013 nine times the figure it was for the Beijing Games of 2008. With a wealth of action taking place during the Games fans from across the globe can interact with each other via various platforms. Sebastian Coe, chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, thinks the strides made in technology means that by the 2020 Games there will be no such thing as a passive armchair fan. \u201cThey (the armchair fans) are part of the action,\u201d he told reporters at the launch of a study by technology firm Atos. \u201cThey can comment on content, interact with the athletes, create and publish their own content. Never before has there been such a channel to interact with the world, especially with young people.\u201d"

Watson\u2019s attempts to disrupt Japanese whalers at sea gained him fame through Animal Planet\u2019s \u201cWhale Wars\u201d TV show. Video: South Korea back on the whaling hunt? The Higher Regional Court in Frankfurt ordered him detained but freed him on a bail of 250,000 euros (about $302,000), according to a court news release, but required him to report regularly to authorities.  He stopped doing so Sunday, the court said. Watson has \u201cshown by fleeing that the trust placed in him was not justified,\u201d the court said, explaining why the extradition orders were reinstated. The Frankfurt court had originally given Costa Rica 90 days to make its case before deciding whether to extradite him. Video: Debate over killer whales in captivity Watson, leader of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, has defended his actions against the Costa Rican vessel, saying \u201cI had to take action with my crew a decade ago to protect hundreds of sharks, and of course, those shark poachers have very powerful allies in government and other places.\u201d The U.S.-based Sea Shepherd has denied wrongdoing in the Costa Rica case and urged supporters through its website and social media to write to German officials, arguing that the charges have less to do with law than with Watson\u2019s anti-conservationist enemies and that it doubts he would get a fair trial. Opinion: Even after attacks, sharks should be protected In the 2002 incident, Sea Shepherd ship operations officer Peter Hammarstedt said, the Ocean Warrior found the Costa Rican crew killing sharks for their fins in Guatemalan waters. It initially had permission from Guatemalan authorities to stop it and tow the vessel into port, he said. The Ocean Warrior used water cannons on the fishing vessel, but \u201cthere were no injuries and no physical damage to any ship,\u201d Hammarstedt said. The Ocean Warrior did stop the ship, but Guatemalan authorities eventually asked Watson to release it, Hammarstedt said. The confrontation is detailed in part of a 2007 documentary, \u201cSharkwater,\u201d Hammarstedt said. Shark finning is the practice of cutting the fins off sharks and throwing the sharks back into the sea, where they die. The fins are used for expensive soup, mostly in China.

The remains were in plastic barrels in a remote woodland near Yekaterinburg, about 1,800 kilometers (1,100 miles) east of Moscow, according to the official news agency RIA Novosti. The drums contained medical waste from several clinics in the city that a company had been hired to destroy, the agency reported, citing regional authorities.  Local residents discovered the barrels, which contained the fetuses ranging in age from 12 weeks to 16 weeks, RIA Novosti reported. The Russian Health Ministry has launched an inquiry, and a member of the Duma, Russia\u2019s parliament, says lawmakers want to investigate the discovery as well.  \u201cI hope that the Investigation Committee will establish where this happened: in what residential area, in which hospital and who organized these criminal activities,\u201d Olga Batalina, the deputy leader of the Duma\u2019s Women, Family and Children Committee, told the Russian newspaper Izvestia."

        "content": "McLaren boss Martin Whitmarsh has called on Formula One\u2019s notoriously argumentative teams to unite and guarantee the future of the sport. F1\u2019s commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone told CNN that the teams had agreed a deal until 2020 to replace the existing Concorde Agreement, which expires at the end of this year, but it has yet to be formally put in place. \u201cMy fear is that at the moment the deal hasn\u2019t been done and therefore it adds some volatility to the situation,\u201d Whitmarsh said on the official F1 website.  \u201cAt times Formula One has lost opportunities because of inner frictions. We create dramas out here between us rather than saying, \u2018Hey, this is a fantastic sport, a world sport, and we should all work together and point in the same direction.\u2019 \u201c Whitmarsh revealed that most of the teams had signed individual contracts, but he warned that a new Concorde deal was needed to tie in motorsport\u2019s ruling body the FIA and dispel rumors of a breakaway competition. Ecclestone: I\u2019ll run F1 until I die \u201cWe must to come to the point of saying Formula One is big and important to all of us, so in large areas we should be aligned, and if we just can put aside our individual differences and focus on what we all want \u2013 for example to be successful in America \u2013 then that reflects on all of us,\u201d he said.  \u201cI hope that there will be a Concorde Agreement that ties it all together because at the moment there are individual contracts. If we were not happy with our contract we wouldn\u2019t have signed it, but the danger is that if we all have individual contracts that is probably not aligning us and bringing us together.  \u201cThe Concorde is a tripartite agreement \u2013 teams, commercial rights holder and FIA. It has never been perfect, but it\u2019s a model that before we abandon it we should be very cautious. Why reinvent something if it functions? Let\u2019s use it.\u201d McLaren, Ferrari and Red Bull are expected to be represented on F1\u2019s new extended board but Whitmarsh said the English team would not take part until all have signed up. \u201cI don\u2019t think that it is a secret anymore that nine teams have signed the contract \u2013 and I really hope that the silver team next door (UK-based Mercedes) will sign very shortly and it will be then that we will take up our board position,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe\u2019d like to see that all the teams have signed before we join the board. I think it has to be clear that anyone joining this board isn\u2019t there to represent their team interests but try to contribute to Formula One and take a broader view.  \u201cIt is a phenomenally interesting opportunity. We have to come together more effectively \u2013 then we can make it an even better sport in the future.\u201d Mayor of London open to capital grand prix Whitmarsh is head of the Formula One Teams Association, which was involved in a bitter row with Ecclestone and the FIA over the future of F1 before finally signing the last Concorde Agreement in 2009. Ferrari, Red Bull and Sauber pulled out in December 2011, raising the prospect of fresh division among the teams. McLaren and Ferrari are the two most successful teams in F1 history, but Whitmarsh said he was confident they could overcome their differences for the good of the sport. \u201cI have a very good relationship with Ferrari. We\u2019ve known them for 30 years now and have been fighting them on the track, in the pit lane, in the paddock, in FIA meetings, in court \u2013 everywhere,\u201d he said.  \u201cI respect that Ferrari is the biggest brand in Formula One. And for McLaren to say that is not something that comes easy. But it\u2019s a fact.  \u201cAnd the second largest brand in Formula One is McLaren. Maybe in 50 years we will be bigger than Ferrari, but at the moment I respect what they represent. Of course we want to beat each other \u2013 that will never change \u2013 but consent should be possible.\u201d Alonso extends lead with victory from pole in Germany Ferrari, without a world title since 2008, has been dominant this year as Fernando Alonso has overcome the Italian marque\u2019s early-season performance problems to lead the championship with three victories from 10 races. McLaren made a strong start as Jenson Button won the opening grand prix, but then had to wait until the seventh in Canada for the next success when Lewis Hamilton came home first. The two former world champions are well off the overall pace. Hamilton trails by 62 points in fifth while last season\u2019s runnerup Button is 86 points adrift in seventh ahead of this weekend\u2019s Hungarian Grand Prix, after which there will be a month-long break.. McLaren\u2019s lack of race pace has led to speculation that Hamilton will not sign a new contract, but Whitmarsh is confident the English driver will continue his career-long association with the team. \u201cBased on what I\u2019ve been told and what I\u2019ve observed, Lewis wants to stay with this team and McLaren very much wants Lewis to stay,\u201d he said.  \u201cMaybe we are over-comfortable with each other, but we haven\u2019t had the urgency to resolve that contract issue, so we all said, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s sort it out in the break.\u2019 And we are only one week away from the break. I suspect that we can resolve it during that period and come back with clarity for the rest of the season.\u201d Latest F1 standings McLaren\u2019s hopes of a first constructors\u2019 crown since 1998 seem slim, trailing Red Bull by 70 points and second-placed Ferrari by 17 at the halfway point \u201cThere is a tough development battle going on. Right now you have to say that Ferrari is the most improved team,\u201d Whitmarsh said. \u201cI think it is also fair to say that sometimes we have severe problems with the tires. I would not say that there is anything wrong with the tires, it\u2019s just that we are right at the knife-edge and sometimes it falls the wrong way.  \u201cThere is no doubt that tires have an enormous effect this year \u2013 probably too much in my view \u2013 but, on the other hand, for the fans it has been an incredibly intriguing season so far.\u201d Whitmarsh believes the unpredictability of results \u2013 there were an unprecedented seven winners from the first seven races \u2013 has made the sport more appealing as it looks to enter new markets. \u201cWe have to connect to younger people, who have got lots of entertainment options apart from sitting in front of the television,\u201d he said.  \u201cFormula One is a world sport, of which there are only two \u2013 soccer and Formula One \u2013 so it is fantastic to see what\u2019s been achieved over the last 30 years. And we should be aiming to do it again in the next 30 years.  \u201cI hope we can capture the imagination in North America. They are such a huge market, they love cars, and we are the premier motor racing in the world. So when we can provide them with entertainment \u2013 and we have a product that is massively exciting \u2013 then I\u2019m sure we can make it.\u201d"

Hollande laid a wreath during the ceremony, and a commemorative plaque was also erected.  In one of the darkest chapters in French history, more than 13,000 Jews were rounded up in their homes on July 16 and 17, 1942, and detained by police on orders of the Vichy government, who were collaborating with the Nazis. The Vichy regime was the French government at the time. Unmarried Jews and couples without children were detained in Drancy, a suburb north of Paris. Families were detained at the Winter Velodrome in Paris for five days in insufferable conditions, with children separated from parents, before they were sent to the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp.  \u201cThese women, these men, these children could not have expected the fate which was reserved for them. They could not have even imagined it. They trusted in France,\u201d Hollande said. Hollande also vowed to fight anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial, calling for more efforts to educate younger generations about the Winter Velodrome incident. \u201cThere cannot be a single school where this story is not fully heard, respected and reflected upon,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the French Republic, there cannot be \u2013 there will not be \u2013 memory that is lost. I will see to it personally.\u201d In total, some 76,000 French men, women and children were deported to Nazi extermination camps during World War II, Hollande said. Only 2,500 came back to France."

Hotels in the Black Sea coastal city of Varna say police have been asking for video showing a particular suspect and are giving a sketch of the suspect to management. Investigators also have questioned workers at a car rental agency near the Black Sea coast where the man attempted to rent a car before Wednesday\u2019s attack, the agency\u2019s owner told CNN. Five Israeli tourists were killed and more than 30 other Israelis were wounded when a suicide bomber blew apart their bus at Burgas International Airport. Explainer: Bulgaria explosion amid growing Iranian-Israeli tension Bulgarian authorities still have not been able to identify the bomber, who was seen on airport security videos about an hour before the attack. They have taken fingerprints and DNA samples and given that information to their counterparts in Israel, the United States and Interpol. The Bulgarian Interior Ministry says it is not ruling out the possibility that the suspect had help, though it won\u2019t comment on reports that authorities are looking for a second suspect. The owner and an employee of the Afrodita Car Rental Agency told CNN a suspicious man wanted to rent a car the Sunday before the attack and tried to use the Michigan driver\u2019s license later found at the scene of the attack. When the owner said he wanted to photocopy the license, the man grew nervous and refused to have it copied. At that point, the owner said he refused to rent the man a car and the man walked out. The car rental owner described the man as having short dark hair and speaking English with an accent. The woman who conducted the forensic reconstruction of the suspected bomber\u2019s face and body, told Bulgarian TV the man had a white face, light eyes and thick dark hair."

The 30-year-old Spaniard was claiming his third victory of the season for Ferrari after wins in Malaysia and the European Grand Prix. He came home just under four seconds clear of the two-time defending champion Sebastian Vettel in his Red Bull. But Vettel was demoted to fifth for running off the track as he overtook McLaren\u2019s Jenson Button on the penultimate lap of 67. He was handed a 20 second penalty by race stewards to leave Britain\u2019s Button in second place and Finland\u2019s Kimi Raikkonen (Lotus-Renault) in the final podium position. Kamui Kobayashi of Japan was promoted to fourth, with Mexican teammate Sergio Perez (Sauber) in sixth. Home hero and seven-time champion Michael Schumacher was seventh for Mercedes ahead of Red Bull\u2019s Mark Webber, who lost ground in the title race. German Nico Hulkenberg, who was ninth for Force India, and his compatriot Nico Rosberg, in the second Mercedes, completed the points scoring. 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton (McLaren) saw his title chances further recede after being forced to retire after a puncture picked up from track debris. It followed an early collision between Ferrari number two Felipe Massa and Frenchman Romain Grosjean of Lotus. For Alonso, a third world title beckons after stretching his lead to 34 points over Australia\u2019s Webber, with Vettel in third, but 10 points further adrift. \u201cWe\u2019ll enjoy the win,\u201d said Alonso. \u201cStarting on pole was the key factor  because it was difficult to overtake and we were not the fastest but we kept the position.\u201d Vettel told the post-race press conference that he had not intended to hinder Button as he overtook the Briton. \u201cThe last thing you want to do is make contact.  When we were side-by-side, I tried to give him enough room \u2013 but it\u2019s difficult to see. \u201cI went wide.

        "content": "Veteran golfer Ernie Els took advantage of a remarkable collapse by long-time leader Adam Scott to win the British Open for the second time at Royal Lytham and St. Annes Sunday. The 42-year-old South African posted a two-under 68 in testing conditions on the links course in North West England to go into the clubhouse on seven-under 273, but Australia\u2019s Scott still looked set to claim his first major title. However, a disastrous run of four straight bogeys from the 15th saw the 32-year-old finish one shot adrift of former world No. 1 Els, who won his fourth major title and his first since claiming the British Open in a playoff in 2002. Son\u2019s autism gives veteran star Els added spur Scott, who had led by four shots going into the final round, pulled his tee shot on the 18th into a bunker, but a fine third left him with an eight-foot putt to force a playoff. It went agonizingly wide of the hole to leave him with a final-round 75 and his hopes of glory cruelly dashed. By contrast, Els finished with a birdie on his final hole and had been on the practice putting green preparing for a possible playoff. He had immediate words of sympathy for the beaten Scott. \u201cFirst of all I feel for Adam. He is a great friend of mine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe both wanted to win very badly but it\u2019s the nature of the beast.\u201d  A stunned Scott, who had started the day four shots ahead of American Brandt Snedeker and Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland, admitted he had blown it. \u201cI\u2019m pretty disappointed. I had it in my hands and managed to hit a poor shot on each of the closing four holes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I played so beautifully for most of the week I certainly should not let this get me down.\u201d The expected challenge from Tiger Woods petered out after he made a triple bogey on the par-four sixth. He eventually carded a three-over 73 to end three under alongside playing partner Snedeker in a tie for third. McDowell, the 2010 US Open champion, also disappointed and fell away with a 75 to tie for fifth at two under with England\u2019s world number one Luke Donald, who raced up the leaderboard with a 69.  Els is the 16th different winner of a golf major in a row, but it looked an unlikely scenario when he was six behind Scott after dropping two shots to the turn. But he picked up birdies at the 10th, 12th and 14th before his last-hole flourish to put the pressure on the Australian, which eventually paid dividends. Els has slipped down the world rankings in recent years and did not qualify to play in this year\u2019s U.S. Masters at Augusta. He had gone without a win in 36 major starts since his 2002 British Open triumph at Muirfield, but had never lost faith. \u201cIt was my time for some reason,\u201d Els said. \u201cA lot of people never thought I would win another one. I started believing this year.\u201d He is the same age as last year\u2019s surprise British Open winner Darren Clarke, who missed the cut in his title defense.  "

So when Els won his fourth major crown on Sunday after Australian Adam Scott capitulated on the closing holes of the British Open, the 42-year-old knew who to thank. \u201cA lot of the Olympic theme this year has got President Mandela in it, so he\u2019s been very much in my thoughts,\u201d Els said of the celebrated former anti-apartheid activist, who turned 94 last week. \u201cBelieve it or not, I was lying watching cricket (South Africa against England) and I was just kind of day-dreaming and that thought came through me in a split second. Scott\u2019s collapse hands British Open crown to Els  \u201cIf I win, I told myself, I\u2019d better thank President Mandela because I grew up in the era of the apartheid, and then changing into the democratic era President Mandela was right there. \u201cRight after the change I was the first one to win a major, so there\u2019s a lot of significance there in my life. In a way we intertwined together in a crazy way and I just felt he\u2019s been so important for us being where we are today as a nation and as sports people.\u201d Els has joined an elite group of golfers \u2013 including Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Bobby Jones, Walter Hagen and Lee Trevino \u2013 who have won two Opens on either side of the Atlantic.  His earlier successes led the way for compatriots Retief Goosen, who won the U.S. Open in 2001 and 2004, Trevor Immelman (2008 Masters winner) and two players he has helped develop through his golf foundation \u2013 Louis Oosthuizen (2010 British Open) and Charl Schwartzel (2011 Masters).

He gets really excited and I wanted to keep him excited, so I made a lot of putts for him.\u201d Els was supposed to have headed straight to Canada for a PGA Tour event, but has delayed that so he can celebrate with Ben, wife Liezl and daughter Samantha. \u201cBen\u2019s coming through now nicely. He\u2019s a wonderful boy now and he\u2019s a bright boy, so we\u2019re going to have a lot of fun.\u201d Els has now won major titles in three different decades, but not along ago it appeared that the former world No. 1\u2019s days as a contender were over. He failed to qualify for this year\u2019s Masters after throwing away a winning position during a PGA Tour event in March, but he rebounded with a ninth-place finish at last month\u2019s U.S. Open as he was again in the title mix on the final day. \u201cNot too many people win majors at my age, it means so much more, it feels so special,\u201d he told CNN.  \u201cYou\u2019re almost blase in a way when you\u2019re young.

He has now moved back up to 15th, and paid tribute to his coach Claude Harmon \u2013 the latest in a line of top instructors from that family, including his father Butch (who also worked with Els) and his namesake grandfather. \u201cHe\u2019s helped me immensely with my game, with confidence and so forth. I\u2019m very grateful to Claude, he\u2019s one of many in that circle around me,\u201d Els said.  \u201cHe\u2019s one of many I want to thank, but obviously Claude is right at the top of the list.\u201d"

        "content": "British prosecutors have charged a former aide to British Prime Minister David Cameron and a close confidant of media baron Rupert Murdoch with illegal eavesdropping on voice mail, authorities said Tuesday. Cameron\u2019s former director of communications Andy Coulson is among eight journalists facing charges, as is Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of Murdoch\u2019s News International. The names of the suspected hacking victims announced include some of the world\u2019s biggest celebrities, including Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Paul McCartney, soccer star Wayne Rooney and actor Jude Law. Read more: Full CPS statement The phone-hacking accusations have reverberated through the top levels of British politics and journalism, led to the closing of a major tabloid and prompted a parliamentary committee to issue damning criticism of Murdoch. The charging announcement delivers one more public relations blow to Murdoch, who last week stepped down from a string of company boards of directors and further distanced himself from the print business that first brought him fame and fortune. Coulson and Brooks are former editors of the defunct Murdoch tabloid the News of the World, which was shut down last year in the face of public outrage at the hacking scandal. That preceded News Corp.\u2019s decision to withdraw a multi-billion-dollar bid to take over British Sky Broadcasting. Likewise, Tuesday\u2019s developments add further potential embarrassment for Cameron, who hired Coulson to run his communications team in May 2010.  Coulson quit the post in Cameron\u2019s office last year when police opened a new investigation into phone hacking. It\u2019s the first time anyone has been charged with phone hacking in the 18-month investigation. Brooks, who was charged with conspiracy to intercept voice mails of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, vigorously denied the charges, saying she was \u201cdistressed and angry.\u201d \u201cThe charge concerning Milly Dowler is particularly upsetting, not only as it is untrue, but also because I have spent my journalistic career campaigning for victims of crime,\u201d she said in a statement released by her lawyers. Coulson said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t and, more importantly, that I didn\u2019t, do anything to damage the Milly Dowler investigation.\u201d He said his tabloid \u201cworked on behalf of the victims of crime, particularly violent crime, and the idea that I would then sit in my office dreaming up schemes to undermine investigations is simply untrue.\u201d He said he was disappointed by the charges and would fight them in court. Another of the suspects named Tuesday appeared to point the finger at others. \u201cI have always operated under the strict guidance and advice of News International\u2019s lawyers and under the instructions of the newspaper\u2019s editors which will be abundantly clear when this matter comes to court,\u201d one-time News of the World chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck said on his blog. Cameron\u2019s office and News International declined to comment, as did McCartney and a number of other celebrities named as potential victims. British law places tight restrictions on what can be reported about people facing criminal charges.  Former British Home Secretary David Blunkett was one of several suspected phone-hacking victims who cited fear of interfering with the prosecution when declining to comment on the charges. Five other journalists were charged, the Crown Prosecution Service announced, while three will not be prosecuted. The CPS said it is still waiting to decide about two other cases. The journalists facing charges include former top News of the World staff, including Thurlbeck, former managing editor Stuart Kuttner and editor Ian Edmondson. Private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, who is suspected of carrying out the hacking, is also among the eight. They are next due to appear in a magistrates court on August 16, the Crown Prosecution Service said. Prosecutors allege there were more than 600 victims of phone hacking between 2000 and 2006.

They were sent to prison for hacking into the voice mails of staffers working for Prince William and Prince Harry. Coulson said he knew nothing about the hacking but resigned because he was editor of the paper at the time. Brooks went on to become chief executive of News International after her time at News of the World and is seen as personally close to Murdoch. She quit News International, the British newspaper publishing arm of News Corp., amid the scandal last summer. Murdoch recently resigned from a number of positions within News Corp., his global media empire, as the company began moves to separate its entertainment and publishing arms following the scandal. News Corp. shares trade in New York, where markets were closed when the CPS made its announcement.  British police have been investigating phone hacking by people working for Murdoch since January 2011 and have arrested dozens on suspicion of phone hacking, computer hacking and corruption.

She was later found murdered. The Met Police continues to investigate claims of phone hacking in their investigation, known as Operation Weeting. A parallel police operation is investigating claims of inappropriate payments to police and public officials.  Cameron established a separate independent judge-led inquiry into media ethics, the Leveson Inquiry, after the news of the hacking of Dowler\u2019s voice messages. Cameron and other senior current and former government figures have been called to testify before the inquiry, as have Murdoch and Brooks. Dowler\u2019s parents told the inquiry in November how phone hacking on behalf of News of the World had given them false hope their missing daughter was still alive. In fact, the messages had been accessed by a private investigator working for News of the World, Dowler\u2019s father, Bob, told the inquiry panel. The young girl had already been murdered.

        "content": "To see Usman Raja before a cage-fight is to see a man in his element. As scantily clad dancing girls parade around and fast paced techno-music blares through the venue, and rows and rows of mostly white working class spectators eagerly await the contest, Raja is in a side room prepping his fighters, sparring with them, and reminding them of the importance of technique. It is a brutal and intensely physical sport. One of his fighters, a towering muscular Pole reaches the heavyweight title match that day, during which he pulverizes his opponent with a volley of powerful kicks and punches, soon knocking him to the floor. \u201cKnee to head,\u201d Raja exclaims as he enters the ring to hug the victorious fighter. Raja is also behind what UK officials say is the most successful effort they have seen to de-radicalize some of the most hardline Islamist extremists being released from UK jails, including around a dozen convicted terrorists who recently completed their prison sentences. He has used cage-fighting as a key tool in this work.  Raja says teaching the former terrorists cage-fighting skills has proved a remarkably effective way of breaking them out of their al Qaeda mentality, opening up their minds to his counter-extremist message, and providing them with a sense of discipline and purpose.  Read how Raja\u2019s controversial technique works, is changing lives, and getting noticed Raja knows how to connect with his charges. Like several of them he is from the tough neighborhoods of east London, once subscribed to fundamentalist views himself, and Raja says he came close to fighting Jihad in Bosnia in the 1990s.  His life story shows the young men he is working with that they can transform their own lives by embracing a spiritual, humanistic, and tolerant Islam.  As a teenager Raja, by his own account, had run wild. He had at first lived in east London but after his father left the family when he was 11, he and his brother Suleiman were brought up on a public housing estate by his mother in Farnborough, a white working class town south west of London dominated by the presence of nearby military barracks. As a single parent, she struggled to provide for them. Raja, as one of the only non-white kids in town, often suffered racial abuse. It started, he said, when he was about eight. \u201cOne guy once asked me \u201chas someone spread excrement on your face?\u201d When I was 13 another guy came up to me and threatened to smash a milk bottle on my head,\u201d Raja said. His response was to fight back. \u201cThe reaction was if I punch him in the face he tastes his own blood \u2013  it\u2019s going to stop him being racist,\u201d Raja recalled. His father came back into his life when he was 16. For a period he and his brother moved up to Huddersfield in northern England to live with him. \u201cIn order to civilize us he got us involved in Thai boxing,\u201d Raja said. The 16-year-old Raja had quite an attitude but, he says, he soon got a reality check, which saw him learn the virtue of self-discipline. \u201cI remember in my third session my Thai boxing coach lifted his elbows, allowed me to kick him as hard as I could in the ribs while sparing, grabbed my head, kneed me in the head and broke my nose and that woke me up,\u201d Raja told CNN. From then on he trained six days a week. \u201cGoing into that reality makes you check yourself,\u201d he said.  At around the same time Raja became inquisitive about Islam for the first time. Though his mother prayed five times a day, religion had never been an important part of his life.  \u201cI had looked at Islam and thought wait a minute, you\u2019ve got a messed up religion where women have to cover their heads and stay at home, while men are out doing what they want,\u201d he recalled.  Like many born again into Islam with little exposure in their youth to Islamic teaching but a desire to deepen their faith, Raja gravitated towards Salafist-fundamentalism. \u201cThat\u2019s just what was out there,\u201d he said. Salafism is a literalist approach to Islam that has taken on different forms across the Muslim world but followers seek a return to what they say are the true values of the religion before these were corrupted by Western modernity and other influences. While many Salafists are Amish-like in focusing all their energies on living their religion, a small but significant number, particularly in the West, have in past decades become politicized. Convicted terrorist calmed by cagefighting \u201cIt was all about Jihad in Afghanistan, Chechnya and Bosnia,\u201d Raja said. There was widespread anger in the Muslim community about the massacres of Muslims by Bosnian-Serbs in the Balkan country.   \u201cI found myself feeling that injustice and wanting to go there and fight that injustice,\u201d Raja recalled. \u201cMy dad was willing to fund that but the mosque committee stopped him,\u201d Raja said. He channeled his energy into fight training, eventually becoming one of the UK\u2019s top cage-fighters. He attended a graphic design course at a college back in Farnborough and earned occasional money as a bouncer, but his priority was fighting.  \u201cYou start to glorify yourself,\u201d Raja recalled. \u201cOver time you realize that ego is the biggest opponent.\u201d The sport was fast taking root and its leading lights were beginning to become lionized like gladiators in Rome. Many of his friends from fighting were white working class who in the early days made up the majority of the sport\u2019s fan base and fighters. Many of them also lived hedonistic life styles: women, nightclubs, and cars. \u201cThough I was a Salafist, it wasn\u2019t like I was puritanical,\u201d Raja said. \u201cFor me it was always more about the oppression of Muslims overseas than Sharia law.\u201d His hand-combat skills also gave him street-cred with young British Salafists who were inspired by mujahideen exploits overseas. Hardly any of the immigrants from Pakistan in his grandfather\u2019s generation had espoused Salafist views. After arriving in the UK, his grandfather founded one of the first mosques in east London, which espoused the tolerant, traditional Islam of his homeland. \u201cBut then the Salafists came along, rolling up their trousers, criticizing jeans,\u201d said Raja. The Millennium was approaching when Raja got what he calls his biggest wake up call. His grandfather fell gravely ill and he visited him in hospital in his final hours. \u201cHe said his only regret in life was not providing more charity, kindness, and generosity to people. This was like a hammer blow to my head; he was the most kind, giving person I knew. His death made me think what are we here on earth to do?\u201d Raja was training in an east London boxing gym when he saw the twin towers collapse in Manhattan on a television monitor. One of his Muslim friends training next to him expressed little surprise given the rising anger against the United States in the Muslim world. But for Raja what had happened was just plain wrong. Check out CNN\u2019s Security Clearance The death of his grandfather had slowly set in motion a change in his religious views. As he learned more about Islam, be became increasingly frustrated by what he saw as the hypocrisies and contradictions of Salafist teaching. In 2003 he met a Malaysian religious teacher Sheikh Aleey Qadir, who had come to the UK in the 1990s to spread a spiritual interpretation of Islam.  Qadir\u2019s religious authority \u2013 and that of several other preachers who developed a global following \u2013 derived from being able to trace a lineage of learning, passed down from teacher to student that stretched back directly to the Prophet Mohammed. They argued that because this unbroken line of knowledge predated the codification of the revelation into text, they had the authority to interpret its true essence. And they rejected what they saw as the slavish anti-modernist literalism of Salafism in favor of Islam as a spiritual pathway, which they accepted was one of different ways, including other religions, to God. \u201cThe message of my teacher was that humanity is all part of one body. If one part of the body is hurt we are all hurt - if one human is killed then we are all killed,\u201d Raja said.  This, Raja says, was the Islam he had always been searching for: tolerant, humanistic, open-minded, and one in which \u2013 because he felt instinctively both British and Muslim \u2013 he could feel comfortable.  Inspired by the Sheikh\u2019s message, Raja felt it was now his mission to help troubled youngsters salvage their lives by making them understand what he had. In his late 20s Raja called time on his own fighting career and began trying to help others.  In 2005, he carried out his first community outreach work with Kurdish Muslims involved in London\u2019s violent criminal underworld, whom he had encountered through his coaching in London gyms. \u201cI had grown up with violence but I\u2019d never seen anything like this,\u201d he said.   Raja says he came to learn their criminality originated from a \u201cdeviant Jihadist subculture\u201d which he says has also been the most fundamental driver of terrorism in the UK. Read about some of Raja\u2019s success stories He says that for too many young Muslims, religious hostility to the West, as well as encouraging terrorist plotting, has justified all manner of crimes, including theft, fraud and tax evasion. \u201cFor these Kurdish mafia guys, their Islamic service was their criminality. It was very odd to me at the time,\u201d Raja recalled.  His rehabilitation work with the Kurds led to him working to prevent youngsters from becoming radicalized by al Qaeda\u2019s ideology. At first he worked with a number of Muslim organizations involved in these efforts, but frustrated by their lack of impact and what he felt was their lack of understanding for the street, he decided to strike out alone. One of the things Raja tried to confront was what he calls an \u201cinsular community mindset\u201d and a \u201cmono-culture\u201d hostile to mainstream British values.  Raja says he was particularly distressed by the widespread homophobia in the Muslim community.  As he describes it, the final piece of the puzzle was meeting his wife Kadija in 2008, a British-Indian Muslim convert, a recently qualified doctor, and the love of his life. She helped mellow him and re-order his priorities. \u201cWith Khadija you\u2019ve got an example of a true Muslim woman,\u201d he says. Together they founded the Unity Initiative in August 2009 and worked in tandem to rehabilitate some of the most hardened Islamist extremists emerging from British prisons by focusing on both the ex-convicts and their wives.  \u201cMost people would probably not like to be in that situation but it the best thing that could have happened - he is my best friend,\u201d Khadija told CNN. Usman and Kadija Raja\u2019s full integration into mainstream British community has provided a stepping stone for the former terrorist convicts they are working with to re-engage with society. In July 2010 the Rajas attended the marriage ceremony of his long-time friend, celebrity cage-fighter Alex Reid to Katie Price, a British glamor model. It was a suitably extravagant affair.  \u201cMy wife wore a hijab,\u201d Raja said, amused by the incongruity. \u201cThe fact that a friend of mind is a high profile fighter allows young Muslims at the street level to know that we are engaged in British society,\u201d Raja told CNN.  When the ex-con-terrorists come to his gym to train, they also mix with fighters who are mostly white working class, broadening their previously insular mindsets. The Rajas still regularly turn to Sheikh Aleey Qadir for guidance, and the cleric often counsels the former terrorist prisoners they are working with.  \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a wishy-washy well-meaning community [initiative]. This is something that has been set up, that is supported by the world\u2019s foremost Islamic scholars,\u201d Raja told CNN. \u201cIt is so exciting because we are actually seeing the results and there is change happening,\u201d said Khadija.

Nikitin was in a heavy metal band as a young man, and got the swastika tattoo then, said festival spokesman Gunther Philipowski. \u201cThat is a problem in Bayreuth,\u201d Philipowski said.  \u201cBayreuth has a bad history with the Nazis. It\u2019s clear that Bayreuth has to be careful about this terrible part of history and has to take a position against it.\u201d The festival is dedicated to the works of Richard Wagner, one of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler\u2019s favorite composers. Hitler attended the Bayreuth Festival regularly, according to the Holocaust Encyclopedia, which describes Wagner as \u201can artist long associated with anti-Semitism\u201d and the racist-nationalist volkisch tradition \u201cfrom which the Nazis drew much of their ideology.\u201d Nikitin, 38, a bass-baritone, has \u201cpainted over\u201d his Nazi tattoo, and it would not have been visible during his performance in \u201cThe Flying Dutchman,\u201d Philipowski said. But there are videos of him online where the tattoo is visible, he said. \u201cI had the tattoos made when I was young. It was a big mistake in my life and I wish I had never done it,\u201d Nikitin said in a statement released by the festival. Nikitin canceled his appearance after discussions with Bayreuth management,  the spokesman said. He had already been in Germany rehearsing for his premiere on Wednesday, Philipowski said.

        "content": "The conservation group World Wildlife Fund ousted Spain\u2019s King Juan Carlos as its honorary president after his Botswana hunting trip sparked an outcry for its extravagance during an economic crisis.  The king\u2019s private visit came to light this year when he was rushed back to Madrid to undergo hip surgery after falling during the trip. A firestorm ensued, forcing the 74-year-old king to apologize in April.  \u201cI am very sorry. I made a mistake and it won\u2019t happen again,\u201d the king said on Spanish state television as he left the hospital.  Spain\u2019s king apologizes for African hunting trip The Spanish chapter of the WWF voted Saturday to abolish the honorary post, which the king has held since 1968. \u201cAlthough not illegal, the hunting was widely viewed as incompatible with the King\u2019s position at the head of WWF-Spain,\u201d the group said in a statement.  There was no immediate response from the royal palace.  Spaniards hold the king in high regard for his service to the nation and his defense of democracy after the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975.  The criticism of the trip initially focused on the expensive safari amid the nation\u2019s 23% unemployment rate and austerity measures to make up for budget shortfalls. Some critics also wondered how much public money was spent for security during the king\u2019s private trip. As the economic crisis was unraveling, the king expressed concern over the impact on Spaniards and urged them to come together to get through the tough times. The royal household has a budget of 8.26 million euros ($10.8 million) this year \u2013  2% less than last year \u2013 and has announced cuts in salaries of some of its staffers. The safari was the latest in a series of scandals for the royal family this year.  In April, the king\u2019s 13-year-old grandson shot himself in the foot with a shotgun during target practice with his father. The legal age in Spain to handle firearms, even when accompanied by an adult, is 14. And the king\u2019s son-in-law, Inaki Urdangarin is a suspect in a financial fraud scandal in which public funds earmarked for his foundation allegedly were diverted for private use.

        "content": "Since 9/11 around 250 Islamist extremists have been imprisoned in the UK after being convicted of terrorism-related charges.  But in the last few years, dozens have been released after completing their prison terms, some of whom have been angered and hardened by their time in prison, creating a major security headache for British authorities in the run up to the Olympic Games. British newspapers have run full page stories on this threat with pictures of several high profile convicts being released back onto UK streets: \u201cGames Fear Over Evil Fanatics,\u201d stated one headline last year.  But now, in an unprecedented interview, one of the released terrorists whose picture was featured in the newspaper reports is speaking out, describing to CNN not only how his life was turned around by an inspirational veteran cagefighter with a pioneering approach to deradicalization, but how under his guidance he has begun to confront al Qaeda\u2019s extremist ideology on the streets of London.  It is the first time a convicted Islamist terrorist in the UK has provided a television interview in the post 9/11 era, and one of the first interviews of its kind anywhere in the West.  Read how Raja\u2019s controversial technique works, is changing lives, and getting noticed Abu Bakr Mansha, now 28, a British Muslim of Pakistani descent, was convicted of terrorism in 2005 in a plot to kill or severely harm a British soldier, and served time in some of Britain\u2019s highest security prisons. But several weeks ago, we sat down with Mansha, a heavily bearded young man with a wiry athletic frame and a gap tooth grin, in a former British army gym in a military barracks town just outside London, which is now used by his new mentor Usman Raja to coach cage-fighting. The two first met in Woodhill High Security prison in early 2011, Raja says, after Mansha wrote a letter asking for his help. By then Raja had developed a reputation among convicted Muslim terrorists \u2013 and British authorities\u2013 as a man dedicated to helping them find a new life and with a success rate that demanded respect. \u201cWe clicked straight away. We got on very well because we have got a lot of things in common. Our family backgrounds are the same, we come from the same place back home,\u201d Mansha told CNN. They had quickly established that both their fathers had known each other in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Mansha had heard of Raja\u2019s work via the imam at the jail, north of London.  He was also intrigued by Raja\u2019s record in cage fighting, or Mixed Martial Arts, a discipline Mansha had already started inside jail.  But at that time what Mansha most needed was someone with the ear of British authorities to help ease conditions for him in prison.  Read about some of Raja\u2019s success stories Raja vividly remembers his first meeting with Mansha.  \u201cJust going into the prison it always shocks me. You never become desensitized to the high fences, the security doors. I had to wait the extra 10 minutes while they went away and got Abu Bakr from segregation,\u201d he told CNN.  Mansha had been sent to solitary confinement after fights with other inmates, which he claims were provoked by hostile prison wardens. \u201cStraight away there was a good connection,\u201d said Raja, who was also struck by Mansha\u2019s almost hyperactive energy. \u201cI was dealing with an individual who came from the real streets of east London,\u201d he recalled.  Mansha was due for release about two months later. Raja promised himself he would do what he could to help him. \u201cThe thought came in to my mind. \u201cLet\u2019s plan, let\u2019s do something constructive and get a support structure there. How can we use that God given energy to do something positive?\u201d\u201c Raja knew he would have a challenge on his hands. He said Mansha had already been released once from jail in 2009 under strict conditions. But his attitude towards probation officers had been so bad that just a few months later he was assessed as still dangerous and recalled back to prison. Mansha started training with Raja immediately after he was released the second time from prison in March 2011.  Like with other young convicted terrorists being released into his care, Raja used mixed martial arts to give him something else to focus on, and as a way to break him out of his radical mindset. Mansha soon set himself a goal to become a coach like Raja. \u201cI could channel my energy straight away and build something for myself,\u201d he told CNN. Read how Raja became an anti-terror inspiration Mansha\u2019s family background was by most definitions middle class. Raja says Mansha grew up in Tower Hamlets, an immigrant neighborhood in east London. His parents and extended family owned a row of houses along their street. His father ran a travel company organizing trips for pilgrims to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. But Mansha, like a significant number of other British-Pakistanis growing up in east London, was drawn into a \u201cgangster\u201d street culture hostile to mainstream Britain, according to Raja. That hostility intensified when U.S. and UK troops invaded Iraq in 2003.  Mansha said: \u201cI left college, left my studies, just went out with my friends on the streets, messing around, not going home. We loved getting in to fights \u2026 that was east London.\u201d Acquaintances told CNN, during this period he became increasingly religious, growing a thick beard.  In 2005, at the age of 21 Mansha was convicted of terrorism. Authorities called it a thwarted plot to kill or severely harm Corporal Mark Byles, a subsequently decorated British soldier who had returned home from fighting in Iraq. When police raided Mansha\u2019s east London residence they found a blank firing gun being converted to live rounds, a balaclava, and a newspaper article with Mansha\u2019s fingerprints on it, featuring the soldier with a paragraph circled which read \u201cCorporal Byles of Portsmouth, Hants, reckons he killed between 15 and 20 insurgents during the war.\u201d They also found a piece of paper with Corporal Byles\u2019 former address and the word \u201chero\u201d written on it in Mansha\u2019s writing, and DVDs featuring anti-Western propaganda, including footage of Osama bin Laden and a video of a British hostage being beheaded by al Qaeda. Mansha still maintains he never plotted to attack the British soldier.  \u201cThe flat at that time, there was a lot of junk there \u2026 no one ever cleaned up. Police picked up little pieces. I understand how they saw it, they put all this stuff together, therefore something was going on.\u201d Mansha told CNN. All Raja knew for sure was that he was dealing with a young man who had become radicalized. In prison Mansha had had time to reflect, making him more open to Raja\u2019s message on his release. Check out CNN\u2019s Security Clearance Once he had won Mansha\u2019s trust, Raja impressed on him that true Islam was spiritual, tolerant, and humanistic, and nothing like the narrow-minded divisive message he had been previously exposed to.  After his release, Raja and his small team spent countless hours counseling Mansha at a variety of locations in east London, including after prayers at mosques and after martial arts training sessions at gyms. During these sessions, Raja encouraged Mansha to ask deep searching questions about his faith. Raja says that like most of his cases, there were moments of frustration, and he has sometimes had difficulty getting Mansha to focus. \u201cMy transformation came over time,\u201d Mansha told CNN. Mansha says he has been strengthened by his new religious understanding. \u201cI didn\u2019t know much about my faith. When I was younger I went to the mosque, I studied the Quran but it was in Arabic so I didn\u2019t know what it was saying,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a big change, a big change, what I know now, my knowledge and my studies, what I know now, how I feel and how I think now.\u201d Mansha\u2019s beliefs are reinforced in talks with Raja\u2019s spiritual teacher Sheikh Aleey Qadir, a Malaysian cleric in east London from a school of Islamic learning that traces its lineage of learning directly to the Prophet Mohammed. \u201cA real transformation comes over him when he sits down with the Sheikh - he becomes all quiet, very much the model pupil,\u201d Raja\u2019s wife, Khadija, said. Raja also got Mansha to re-engage with the British value system. \u201cTake away someone\u2019s hate and they feel liberated,\u201d Raja told CNN. \u201cOnce these guys are given back their sense of belonging to society they want to give back that energy.\u201d Mansha\u2019s horizons were widened by his MMA training sessions. Most of the other fighters being trained by Raja were white working class; joshing around with them in the gym, and being accepted by them, helped change Mansha\u2019s worldview. Mansha\u2019s loyalty to Raja\u2019s message was illustrated when one day Anjem Choudary, a prominent east London radical Islamist who helped build up al Muhajiroun one of the UK\u2019s most notorious pro al Qaeda groups, came over to shake Mansha\u2019s hand to congratulate him on his service to the cause, according to Raja. \u201cI\u2019m not with you. I\u2019m with Usman Raja now,\u201d Mansha replied, according to what he later told Raja. \u201cIf he has changed his views and he does stand with Usman Raja obviously that is his choice. At the end of the day this is a grave mistake because these people don\u2019t represent Islam,\u201d Choudary told CNN. Choudary added: \u201cPeople like Usman Raja have apostated from Islam \u2026 they have gone outside of the fold of Islam because of their allegiance with the British government against their community.\u201d The new Mansha is trying to stop other youngsters going down the path he did. \u201cI learned the hard way,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI see the youngsters now, their understanding is very limited, narrow minded,\u201d Mansha told CNN. \u201cWe have to get out there \u2026 put ourselves out there. I\u2019m doing that in my community. I\u2019ll do anything for them youngsters \u2026 put them in the right line.\u201d One example of his outreach work was persuading a British radical who had unceremoniously set fire to a large paper poppy, the British symbol of remembrance for their war dead, to see the error of his ways. The stunt, which was captured on film, had been organized by Choudary\u2019s group, then operating under the name Muslims Against Crusades, on November 11, 2010 - Armistice day - while Mansha was still in prison, and had caused outrage. \u201cIf someone burned the Quran, I know what I\u2019d be thinking, what I\u2019d feel, every Muslim would be feeling. I did speak to that brother when I came outside \u2026 he realized his mistake,\u201d Mansha told CNN. Now Raja believes Mansha, and other rehabilitated terrorists he has worked with, could be effective in carrying a message of tolerance to east London streets. \u201cTheir whole future is going to be marked by being a convicted terrorist. So we tell them if they had never gone down that path they would never have met us and been given the chance to help others. The key is to give them a sense of purpose.\u201d"

The 32-year-old finished on 11-under par, four clear of overnight leader Brandt Snedeker, who struggled to a 73 and Northern Ireland\u2019s Graeme McDowell (67) with Tiger Woods lurking a shot further back on six-under par.  In benign conditions on the Lancashire coast, Scott put together a composed round, picking up two birdies on the opening nine before bagging another at the par-five 11th.   A bogey at the 13th checked his progress but the Australian, who is bidding to win his first major championship, came home in even par \u2013 aided by a stunning bunker shot at the 17th.    \u201cA four shot lead doesn\u2019t seem to be very much this year on any golf tournament that I\u2019ve watched. That doesn\u2019t mean a lot,\u201d Scott said.  \u201cThe good part is if I play a solid round of golf tomorrow, it will be very hard for the others to beat me, and that\u2019s all I\u2019m thinking about,\u201d he added.  Snedeker, who hadn\u2019t dropped a shot in the opening 36 holes, saw shots slip away in a hurry on Saturday, arriving at the turn three-over par for his round.    Further shots went at the 11th and 14th before two birdies in the closing three holes dragged the 31-year-old back into contention.    Woods who is bidding to win a 15th major title, recovered from a bogey, par, bogey start to finish with an even-par 70.  \u201cI turned it around. I got off to an awful start and battled back and got myself right back in the mix again going into tomorrow, and I\u2019m right there,\u201d Woods said.  \u201cI\u2019m five back. So Adam is in a great spot right now, he\u2019s got a four shot lead and he\u2019s playing really well. He\u2019s going for his first major title. So he\u2019s in a very good spot,\u201d the 14-time major champion said. America\u2019s Zach Johnson\u2019s round of 66 was the lowest of the day and lifted him to joint fifth alongside South Africa\u2019s Ernie Els (68) on five-under par, while 22-year-old Dane, Thorbjorn Olesen is four-under after a one-over 71.  Reigning Masters champion Bubba Watson is currently locked in a three-way tie for 10th place with former Open winner\u2019s Louis Oosthuizen and Mark Calcavecchia on two-under par.   World number one Luke Donald is a shot further back after a one-over par 71.  Northern Ireland\u2019s Rory McIlroy continued his stuttering form of late, carding a three-over 73 to leave him tied for 64th on five-over par while Scotland\u2019s Martin Laird had a day to forget.  The 29-year-old started the day one-under par, but slumped to a 12-over par 82 leaving him in last place, one shot behind America\u2019s John Daly who struggled to a 77. "

        "content": "A year after Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people in a bomb and gun rampage in Norway, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg urged Norwegians to \u201chonor the dead by celebrating life.\u201d Breivik, a self-declared ultranationalist who raged against Muslim immigration and multiculturalism, failed to achieve his goals, Stoltenberg said Sunday. \u201cThe bombs and bullets were intended to change Norway. The Norwegian people responded by reasserting our values,\u201d Stoltenberg said. \u201cThe perpetrator failed to achieve what he set out to do. The people triumphed.\u201d He called on people to remember their murdered loved ones with joy. Norway massacre, mourners pay respect \u201cNo one can take the warm memories away from you. A father\u2019s reassuring hand. The sounds from a child\u2019s playroom. The memories of goodness and joy cannot be erased,\u201d he said. And he asked Norwegians to respond to the horror by reaching out to people who may be suffering and in need of help. \u201cWe will not forget you when the long days of summer give way to autumn darkness,\u201d he said at a ceremony marking the anniversary. \u201cReach out. Show that you care. A chat about everyday things could help someone regain their will to live.\u201d Norwegians observed a minute of silence to mark the worst atrocity on Norwegian soil since World War II, as Americans reeled from an enormous mass shooting two days earlier.

Holmes, 24, is accused of killing 12 people and wounding 58 in the suburban Denver community of Aurora during a midnight screening of the Batman movie \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d on Friday. In Norway, Breivik is on trial on charges of voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror in the July 22, 2011 attacks.  He admits bombing a government building in Oslo before heading to an island summer camp, where he opened fire as terrified youth jumped into water to escape the hail of bullets.  The twin attacks killed 77 people, including 69 at the Labour Party summer camp. Many of the victims there were teenagers. The court must determine whether Breivik was sane at the time of the killings. Mental health experts have given conflicting opinions. Breivik gave chilling details of the gun rampage during his trial this year. Without apparent emotion, he recounted firing more bullets into teenagers who were injured and couldn\u2019t escape, killing those who tried to \u201cplay dead\u201d and driving others into the sea to drown. Some survivors and relatives of victims in the courtroom wept as they listened to his detailed account of the attack on the youth camp on Utoya Island.  Breivik told the court he had made use of lessons learned from al Qaeda in planning his attacks, and was inspired by the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center bombings.  He boasts of being an ultranationalist who killed his victims to fight multiculturalism in Norway, and says he acted out of \u201cnecessity.\u201d Experts\u2019 assessment of Breivik\u2019s sanity will be a factor in determining what punishment he receives if convicted. Sentencing options could include imprisonment or confining him to a mental facility. His verdict is expected August 24. Numerous events are scheduled nationwide Sunday to mark the first anniversary of the killings, including religious services and wreath-laying ceremonies to pay tribute to victims of the attacks.

The former double world champion and current championship leader sped to his second consecutive pole of the season in a time of one minute 40.904 seconds, holding off Red Bull\u2019s Sebastian Vettel who joins the Spaniard on the front row of the grid. \u201cWe made a good strategy call to do a pit stop in Q3 so we could have fresher tires in the last minute.

        "content": "Bulgarian police have been alerted to the possibility of a second suspect in a bomb attack that killed five Israeli tourists in Burgas,  a high-level source in Bulgaria\u2019s Interior Ministry told CNN.   Investigators have determined that the bomb was detonated by a man caught on airport security videos about an hour before Wednesday\u2019s attack at Burgas International Airport. But they are now looking at the possibility that he had help.   According to the source, investigators have spoken to several eyewitnesses in attempt to identify the bomber. They describe a man with short hair who spoke English with a \u201cdistinct\u201d accent. This is different from the man seen on the security video who has long hair, however, leading investigators to look into the possibility that a second person may be involved, a source said.  Police in Burgas have been given an identikit photo of the man and told to look out for anyone matching this description. Bulgaria investigators seeks clues to suicide bomber\u2019s identity Earlier, a lower-level source at the Interior Ministry told CNN that police were looking for a second suspect, possibly an American.   That was later corrected by a higher-level source, who said a second suspect was a possibility, but had not been confirmed.   At least two hotels in Burgas told CNN that police had come with an identikit photo looking for a man in connection with the attack.  Five Israeli tourists and the Bulgarian bus driver died in the blast, as well as the bomber. More than 30 other Israelis were injured, some seriously. Israel has said it suspects Iran or an Islamist militant group such as Hezbollah is behind the attack, a claim that has added to tension between Israel and Tehran. Iran, which has condemned the attack, has rejected Israel\u2019s claims. The man who carried out the suicide bombing was carrying what the Interior Ministry has said was a fake Michigan driver\u2019s license. Amidst global instability, travel and tourism affected Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak on Saturday reiterated Israel\u2019s claim that Hezbollah, which has close ties to Iran, was responsible for the bombing in remarks aired on CNN affiliate Channel 10.  \u201cWe know that Hezbollah is behind the attack. We know he had a fake driver\u2019s license from Michigan. We know he had a Western appearance and not the look of someone from the Middle East,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment we don\u2019t know exactly who he was, but the truth is that it doesn\u2019t matter. The trend is that terror bodies are taking people with European looks, in order to get past the immediate eye-contact test of the face. This is known and it is not the first time it has happened.\u201d Asked how Israel would respond, he said it would first find out who sent the bomber and then, \u201cwhen the time comes, we will act in the appropriate way.\u201d Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said Friday in a news conference broadcast on Bulgarian National TV that investigators were working round the clock to find new leads in the case, in collaboration with their Israeli counterparts and international organizations such as Interpol and Europol. The suicide bomber was a foreigner who entered the country with fake identification documents and had been in Bulgaria for at least four days, the minister said. But authorities still don\u2019t know from where he came, where he stayed or what he did while in Bulgaria, he added. The bomb is believed to have been concealed in a backpack placed by the bomber on a bus in a parking lot outside the airport. How Bulgaria became a terrorist target Tsvetanov said Friday that he was not excluding the possibility that a second person might have been involved. Experts are certain from DNA analysis of body parts found at the scene that the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber, he added. The flag-draped coffins of the Israelis killed in the attack were flown in a military aircraft early Friday to Tel Aviv, where they were greeted with a ceremony. Thirty-six of those injured have also been transferred back to Israel for treatment. The airport bus targeted by the attacker was to have taken 47 passengers to a beach resort. Bulgarian officials have sought to reassure those worried by what is an unusual attack in the nation, saying security has been boosted wherever needed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that the attack was \u201cperpetrated by Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s leading terrorist proxy,\u201d as part of a global campaign that has reached a dozen countries on five continents, but he offered no evidence. Israel\u2019s U.S. Embassy said a day earlier that it had no proof that Iran was the instigator of the attack. Pentagon Press Secretary George Little said Friday that the attack \u201cdoes bear the hallmarks of Hezbollah.\u201d He refused to elaborate. Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, said Israel was engaging in \u201cbaseless accusations against other countries in order to distract the attention of the international community from its terrorist activities being carried out throughout the world,\u201d according to a statement from the state-run IRNA news agency.

        "content": "Brandt Snedeker leads the British Open after Friday\u2019s eventful second round. The American matched Adam Scott\u2019s incredible opening round of 64 to claim a one stroke lead over the  Australian.  Tiger Woods was a further three strokes behind on six under par. The 14 time major winner holed a tremendous chip shot out of the bunker at the 18th to end his round with a birdie. Snedeker\u2019s impressive five under par opening round was overshadowed by Scott\u2019s record breaking first day. However, the Nashville native leapfrogged his rival who posted a 67 stroke round.  Following his near faultless second round, Snedeker is now the only player in the competition who has not dropped a shot. Snedeker also matched Nick Faldo\u2019s long standing halfway record score of 130 - which has been unmatched since 1992.  \u201cI\u2019m in shock right now,\u201d the world number 29 told the British Open website.   \u201cI feel pretty good not to have dropped a shot so far this week and am proud to tie the championship 36-hole record. \u201cAll I\u2019m trying to do is to hit the middle of the greens and not get in any trouble.\u201d Woods, who has failed to add to his 14 majors since winning the 2008 U.S. Open, dropped a stroke with a bogey at the 11th, but stayed in contention with four birdies. His sumptuous chip on the final hole had the crowd cheering, but Woods claimed the shot \u201cwasn\u2019t as hard as it may have looked.\u201d \u201cOverall I\u2019m very pleased at where I\u2019m at - I\u2019m right there in the mix,\u201d the three time British Open winner said. \u201cI figured I had a game plan that I thought would fit well on this golf course and I figured I could execute it. \u201cIt\u2019s just patience on a golf course like this. I\u2019m hitting the ball in the fairway. You can take your chances, but you\u2019d better pull it off or be conservative and play to different spots.\u201d Dane Thorbjorn Olesen was one shot behind Woods, with 2010 U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell and Americans Jason Dufner and Matt Kuchner one shot behind on four under par.  Why U.S golf has a healthy future Current world number one Luke Donald rescued his championship with a roller coaster round that ended with the Englishman two under par. Donald opened with a bogey at the third, but regained his form with four birdies that put the current European golfer of the year back in contention. A further two bogeys at the start of the back nine looked to have ended the comeback but a birdie at the 15th meant Donald finished tied for 11th.  \u201cI\u2019m certainly feeling more comfortable,\u201d Donald said at the end of his faltering round.  \u201cObviously, where I am in my career I need to be contending,\u201d said Donald, whose best finish at a major is third. World number two Rory McIlroy struggled to find his game as he struggled to a 75, leaving him two over par and little to play for with the final two rounds. A double on the ninth looked to be the turning point for the Northern Irishman, who admitted \u201cit wasn\u2019t the best day out there.\u201d \u201cI was doing pretty well just to hang on in there around par on the front nine. Making a double on the ninth was sort of the turning point in the round and I couldn\u2019t really recover from that,\u201d said the 2011 U.S. Open champion.  There will be some notable absentees from the weekend\u2019s action, with reigning British Open champion Darren Clarke one of those heading home.  American Phil Mickelson, a four time major winner, former world number one Martin Kaymer and three time Ryder Cup winner Sergio Garcia also missed the cut.  Northern Irishman Clarke admitted he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with his defense of the title won at Royal St. George last year.  \u201cI would have liked to have come here and put up a good score in defense,\u201d said Clarke.  American Mickelson, who has spent over 700 weeks ranked inside golf\u2019s top ten, struck three double bogeys and three bogeys as he carded a round of 78.  \u201cI hit it solid but I didn\u2019t hit it straight, and I found a lot of bunkers off the tee,\u201d Mickelson complained.  \u201cI thought I was going to have a little bit of a better round than I did.\u201d Play continues on Saturday, with the concluding round on Sunday.

        "content": "Do you need to be a jockey to ride a horse? Do you need to be a doctor to run a hospital? Maybe not in all cases, but a new study suggests that you will be more successful in management if you have skills specific to your realm of operations. These days the trend is very much toward professional managers \u2013 executives who swap industries as they please. However, in the rarified world of Formula One at least, it appears that it pays to employ from within. And with an average annual team budget of $173 million, there is pressure to get it right. \u201cFormer top drivers, such as Jean Todt, consistently turn into successful Formula One bosses \u2013 even when we account for factors such as the resources available to each team,\u201d says Amanda Goodall of Britain\u2019s Cass Business School. Webber: F1\u2019s joker in the pack? Goodall co-authored a study which discovered that F1 teams managed by individuals who know the sport inside out win twice as many races as their general manager counterparts. Examining all 18,000 F1 races from 1950-2011, the study revealed that former drivers and mechanics are significantly more successful than those with degrees in engineering or who were managers by trade. Todt, for example, is now president of motorsport\u2019s ruling body the FIA. Following a 15-year rally driving career and a stint as Peugeot\u2019s director of racing, he joined Ferrari\u2019s F1 setup. Having been responsible for bringing Michael Schumacher to the team, the Frenchman later became the Scuderia\u2019s chief executive. While he presided over multiple world titles, his 2008 replacement Stefano Domenicali \u2013 a business school graduate \u2013 has struggled to repeat the success of the Schumacher era, winning nothing. \u201cWe can see why comparative newcomers like Red Bull and Sauber are doing so well in Formula One. These teams may not have a 50-year history like Ferrari but they are led by hands-on experts with deep intuition,\u201d Goodall said. Red Bull, formed from the Jaguar team in 2005, has dominated the past two years with world titles in both driver and manufacturer categories.  The Austrian-owned marque is led by Christian Horner, who started out as a racing driver in F1\u2019s development  divisions before running his own team in his mid-20s. Sauber\u2019s restored fortunes have come since founder Pete Sauber rebought the team from BMW in 2009 \u2013 though the 68-year-old is gradually handing over control to chief executive Monisha Kaltenborn, whose background is in law. The authors of the Cass report say the study shows that being a capable general manager may no longer be sufficient, and that employees respond better to leaders who have a deep understanding of their trade. In fact, a previous study conducted by the same authors discovered that hospitals headed by doctors perform better than those led by professional managers. \u201cFrom an early age, driver-leaders develop technical knowledge about the underlying activity of grand prix racing,\u201d the F1 study states. \u201cThey acquire extensive experience in formulating driving tactics, and are able to make decisions under time pressure and stress. This inherent knowledge and industry expertise may, we suggest, inform organizational strategy when drivers become principals.  \u201cWe also argue that former drivers may appear more credible to their F1 team colleagues, which extends their influence. Finally, because of a shared value system between the team and leader, driver-leaders may create a more appropriate work environment for the team.\u201d"

        "content": "The Olympic torch is set to make a dramatic entry to London Friday, descending via a 180-foot line from a helicopter to the historic Tower of London. The torch\u2019s arrival in the capital begins the final week before the Games open and the final stage in its long journey. More than 10 million people have already lined the streets of more than 1,000 communities around Britain to see the torch, which has been carried by more than 7,000 torchbearers, Olympic organizers said. Nearly 1,000 more will carry the torch along nearly 200 miles of London streets over the coming week, before it takes a starring role at the opening ceremony at the Olympic Park on July 27. Read about Greece passing the Olympic flame to Britain Eighteen torchbearers will carry the flame on the final day of the relay, with seven of them traveling with it down the River Thames on the royal barge Gloriana, which played a central role in the Diamond Jubilee river pageant for Queen Elizabeth II. The torch\u2019s arrival at the Tower of London on Friday evening promises to be eye-catching. A Royal Marine commando, carrying the flame in a lantern, will abseil \u2013 the technique known as \u201crappel\u201d in the United States \u2013 180 feet from a Royal Navy Sea King helicopter into the grounds, where London Mayor Boris Johnson will be waiting to greet it. The torch will be carried around the Tower, which dates back to the 11th century, before spending the night in the safekeeping of the Jewel House, home of the Crown Jewels. The buildup to the Olympics has been overshadowed by a security fiasco caused by the failure of contractor G4S to supply enough guards for the Games. 2012 Olympic flame lit in ancient stadium But Johnson told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson that while London authorities are not complacent, he is confident in their ability to keep visitors safe. \u201cWe do everything in our power to maximize security at the venues and that\u2019s working well now \u2013 the army, the military as well as G4S are providing very safe conditions on the site, plus there is a huge amount of work that nobody has seen involving the intelligence service,\u201d the mayor said  \u201cThat\u2019s something about an event like this \u2013 you listen out for what may or may not be happening on the Internet, you try as hard as you possibly can to monitor the potential suspects.\u201d Johnson said it is impossible to guard against all \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d and that\u2019s why strong security is needed at venues. \u201cAt no stage can you guarantee that someone won\u2019t do something moronic, stupid, violent and tragic, not just in London but the whole of the UK is a potential target in this period,\u201d he said. But at the same time, he said, \u201cthe intelligence is as reassuring as it could be under the circumstances. The threat level as far as we are aware has slightly come down in the last 12 months, but you can never be certain.\u201d Look at photos of the journey of the Olympic flame Authorities said Thursday that an additional 1,200 British troops were being placed on standby for the Olympic Games. The company\u2019s recruitment shortfall had already forced the government to call in 3,500 extra military personnel to help. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, the minister in charge of overseeing the Games, said that there was no need to deploy extra troops but that putting 1,200 on standby means they can be moved within 48 hours rather than seven days if required. G4S has a \u00a3284 million ($444 million) government contract to provide 10,400 security staff for the Olympic Games, but only about 4,000 guards are trained and ready. It expects to provide at least 7,000 by the time the Games start, chief executive Nick Buckles told lawmakers earlier this week. Home Secretary Theresa May gave more details on how the fiasco unfolded in a letter sent to the head of Parliament\u2019s Home Affairs Committee on Thursday. Although the Home Office did not become aware of the full extent of the shortfall until July 11, G4S had alerted the government to \u201cscheduling problems\u201d affecting staff numbers on June 28, she said. Once it became clear how large the shortfall would be, the government put its contingency plans into operation, she wrote. \u201cG4S will still be making a substantial contribution to venue security,\u201d she wrote.   \u201cAll G4S personnel working on venue security duties will have had training for the role they are undertaking,\u201d May added. The G4S recruits are supposed to perform tasks including venue perimeter security, such as manning X-ray machines, searching people, searching vehicles and operating closed-circuit television systems, the company said."

Okay, it won\u2019t be like it was with Michael Schumacher between 1996 and 2006 when he was the undisputed number one in the team, but whoever ends up there will be playing \u2013 at best \u2013 second fiddle.  Perhaps that\u2019s one of the reasons why Mark Webber, who was touted as a possible Ferrari driver, has signed up to race alongside two-time Formula One champion Sebastian Vettel for another year at Red Bull.  Webber led for much of the 2010 world championship only to lose out to Vettel at the season\u2019s end, but last year he was completely overshadowed: one win to the German\u2019s 11, and that came in the final grand prix when his younger teammate had a gearbox problem and let him through. This year, though, he\u2019s had the measure of Vettel \u2013 he\u2019s 16 points ahead in second place overall after heading off Alonso and Vettel to win the British Grand Prix, and he\u2019s arguably getting on better with this year\u2019s Red Bull.  Webber pips Alonso to take British Grand Prix  You\u2019d put your money on the Australian having a better race than his 25-year-old colleague at this weekend\u2019s German Grand Prix. And that\u2019s before you look at Vettel\u2019s record in his home event, which consists of two podiums, but no win.  Rewind to 2009, and this race is where Webber won his very first grand prix at the age of 32 \u2013 though that year it was held at Nurburgring; this weekend it will be at Hockenheim, as the venues alternate.  Red Bull\u2019s designer Adrian Newey admitted that Webber was absolutely gutted to miss the championship in 2010, so much so that he brought some of that negative feeling into the next season. However, the reason for his troubles last year were even more basic than that.  The winning Formula for success? 2011 was the year of the exhaust-blown diffuser \u2013 a system whereby the designers managed to get the exhausts to \u201cblow\u201d over the rear diffuser even when the driver didn\u2019t have their foot on the throttle. This created a significant amount of downforce and extra grip, meaning the cars cornered like they were on rails and the drivers got less feedback through the steering wheel.  Webber wasn\u2019t a fan, unlike Vettel \u2013 who changed his style to suit the new characteristics.  Not only did Webber struggle to get the best out of the super-grippy car, but he also found the Pirelli tires difficult. If you\u2019re up against one of the best drivers in the world as your teammate, you don\u2019t need problems like that. Sure enough he was regularly over half a second off Vettel\u2019s pace, and that \u2013 in F1 terms \u2013 is an age.  Webber signs one-year Red Bull extension This year the exhaust-blown diffusers have been banished from the sport, as have Webber\u2019s troubles. Yes, the Pirelli tires continue to confound the drivers because of their complexity, but what the 35-year-old does have is that \u201cfeel\u201d back from the steering wheel.  It may sound like a weak excuse, but in order to gain that last percent of performance in F1, drivers need to balance the car on a knife-edge. If you aren\u2019t aggressive enough you\u2019ll tumble down the time sheets; if you fall the other side of the blade, you\u2019ll rumble into the barriers. Part of that balance is being able to feel every minute detail of what the car is. Unlike 2011, this year is not all about the speed of the Red Bull, though. The German Grand Prix will not just be a two-horse race between Webber and Vettel.  Webber wins Monaco Grand Prix  Ferrari has managed to transform its car into a competitive machine after a slow start to the season, and McLaren should improve following a \u201ccrisis meeting\u201d after the British Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button finished down in eighth and 10th at Silverstone, soundly beaten by both the Lotus cars, which is not where they expected to be. There\u2019s a limit to what a team can do in two short weeks in order to turn their fortunes around, but McLaren is the best in the business when it comes to in-season development.  When the lights go out at the start of the race on Sunday, Webber will \u2013 qualifying problems aside \u2013 be feeling confident. And rightly so."

        "content": "Investigators in Bulgaria are working around the clock to identify the man suspected of killing five Israeli tourists and their bus driver in an airport suicide bombing, the country\u2019s interior minister told reporters Friday. Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said police were trying to piece together the movements of the suspect, who was carrying a fake Michigan driver\u2019s license. Investigators are also working to analyze the bomb, believed to have been located in a backpack placed Wednesday on the bus in a parking lot outside Burgas International Airport, Tsvetanov said. Israel has said it suspects Iran or an Islamist militant group such as Hezbollah is behind the attack, a claim that has added to tension between Israel and Tehran. Iran, which has condemned the attack, has rejected Israel\u2019s claims. The bodies of the five Israelis arrived Friday morning in Israel, said ZAKA, the volunteer emergency search-and-rescue organization that had gone to Bulgaria to recover them. The coffins, loaded onto a military plane at Burgas airport, were greeted with a ceremony on arrival at Ben Gurion airport outside Tel Aviv. Israeli Tourism Minister Stas Misezhnikov said at the service: \u201cThis is a cruel, deliberate and well-orchestrated wave of terror. Its aim is to target Jews and Israelis, to take down human lives, to kill the freedom.\u201d Among the victims was Kochava Shriki, who was on the bus with her husband and had learned that morning that she was pregnant, CNN affiliate Channel 10 reported. Childhood friends Maor Harush and Elior Priess also died, as did Itzik Kolongi and Amir Menashe, two men who were on holiday with their wives. As Israelis grieved Friday, Bulgaria continued the hunt for clues as to who was responsible. \u201cAt the moment, we are focused on finding the identity of the suicide bomber, and of course from the moment of the blast every single minute and every single hour of his being on the territory of Bulgaria,\u201d Tsvetanov said in a news conference broadcast on Bulgarian National TV. Explosion amid growing Iranian-Israeli tensions The suspect was a foreigner who entered the country with fake identification documents and had been in Bulgaria for at least four days, he said. Experts believe the attack was planned for the precise moment and place that it happened, he said, and they are certain from DNA analysis of body parts found at the scene that the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber. But Tsvetanov said he was not excluding the possibility that a second person might have been involved. Bulgarian authorities are working with their Israeli counterparts and international organizations like Interpol and Europol to identify the suspect, Tsvetanov said. Authorities still don\u2019t know from where the suicide bomber came, where he stayed or what he did, Tsvetanov said. A witness has said the suspect tried to rent a car from him but didn\u2019t have a proper driver\u2019s license, so was turned away, the minister said. FBI officials have said the man\u2019s Michigan license was fake. See latest photos of the explosion scene Security footage aired by Bulgarian National TV shows the suspect, \u2013 a white man with long hair and wearing khaki shorts, a baseball cap and sneakers \u2013 looking relaxed as he walks among other travelers, carrying a backpack and a smaller bag. In addition to the fatalities, the bombing wounded more than 30 Israeli tourists, some seriously. Israel\u2019s military flew 36 of the wounded back Thursday to Tel Aviv, where they were taken to Israeli hospitals.  The airport bus targeted by the attacker was to have taken about 47 passengers to a beach resort. Bulgaria, whose Black Sea resorts are a popular destination for Israelis, has not speculated on who may have been responsible for the attack. Bulgaria received nearly 8.4 million visitors in 2010, the last year for which U.N. World Tourism Organization figures are available. The vast majority of the country\u2019s visitors that year, more than 8 million, came from Europe. About 25,000 visitors came from the Middle East. U.S. President Barack Obama spoke with Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov by phone on Friday. He condemned the \u201cbarbaric attack,\u201d gave his condolences and offered support for the investigation. Bulgarian officials have sought to reassure those worried by what is an unusual attack in the nation, saying security has been boosted wherever needed. Read Netanyahu\u2019s statement here Burgas airport has reopened and is functioning normally, Tsvetanov said, but access was restricted to passengers. In a televised statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that the attack was \u201cperpetrated by Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s leading terrorist proxy,\u201d as part of a global campaign that has reached a dozen countries on five continents. But he offered no evidence. Israel\u2019s U.S. Embassy said Wednesday that it had no proof that Iran was the instigator of the attack. Pentagon Press Secretary George Little said Friday that the attack \u201cdoes bear the hallmarks of Hezbollah.\u201d He refused to elaborate. Netanyahu said Hezbollah and Iran have been trying to foment terrorism in countries that include Kenya, India and Cyprus, as well as in the United States, where an Iranian is accused of trying to kill the Saudi diplomat. Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, said Israel was engaging in \u201cbaseless accusations against other countries in order to distract the attention of the international community from its terrorist activities being carried out throughout the world,\u201d according to a statement from the state-run IRNA news agency. The Iranian Embassy in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia said earlier that Israeli suggestions that Tehran was involved in the attack were \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d and that the assertion was politically motivated."

        "content": "Hailed as the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest golf course\u201d by its owner before it had even opened, Trump International Links has a lot to live up to. The statement would have been ridiculed by the golfing community had it not been made by a man who has pumped $150 million into his dream to date, with plans to spend over $1 billion by the time the controversial Scottish project is completed.  It has already bulldozed past environmentalists\u2019 concerns, but Donald Trump is reluctant to continue development due to a planned offshore wind farm. The fact that some of the key names in European golf attended this month\u2019s opening \u2013 surrounded by bagpipers and the miles of towering sand dunes along its Aberdeenshire coast site \u2013 is testament to the power of his brand. The American billionaire owns a dozen luxury golf resorts \u2013 including Florida\u2019s faded Doral and its renowned \u201cBlue Monster\u201d course which he plans to renovate \u2013 but can his UK venture be considered a contender for top spot so early on?   Blowing in the wind? Trump threatens to ditch $1B Scottish golf resort Of course, criteria for judging the \u201cgreatest\u201d vary from golfer to golfer, with emphasis ranging from degree of challenge to spectacular views or history. For Trump International to be considered as one of the greats, it first has to establish itself as a venue among Scottish links courses. That will be no mean feat, with illustrious company including \u201cthe home of golf \u201cSt. Andrews and other current Open venues Muirfield, Turnberry, Royal Troon and Carnoustie.  Turnberry stands out as the most picturesque of those courses, while Muirfield hosts the world\u2019s oldest golf club and Carnoustie is often regarded as the toughest. On the other side of the Irish Sea, there are the two outstanding links courses currently vying to host an Open; Royal County Down and Royal Portrush.  There\u2019s also hot competition south of the border in England, including the traditional highly-rated links of Royal St. George\u2019s and this year\u2019s Open venue, Royal Lytham and St. Annes. The latter has seen the great amateur golfer Bobby Jones in 1926 and flamboyant Spaniard Seve Ballesteros in 1979 and 1988 among its victors. Trump International is starting on the back foot against its British rivals, but with broadcast cables already running beneath the course and a plan in place for several thousand spectators, it has a strong case to one day host major tournaments. Perhaps a fairer match for the new course would be against eight-year-old Cape Kidnappers in New Zealand, which runs along and around ridges on a secluded stretch of jagged coastline. It has already jumped up magazine rankings and attracted visitors from around the world with its spectacular views.  The edge that Trump International possesses is that it can be classed as links golf, which is favored by purists as the \u201ctrue\u201d setting for the game.  Acclaimed English golf architect Martin Hawtree has skilfully routed holes around and between the massive dunes, some measuring 80 feet in height. His family business has worked on course designs for a hundred years and put its hand to several British Open venues. To get to the very top, Trump\u2019s new creation must surpass several private and exclusive courses in his home country, which have dominated magazine rankings for decades.  Cypress Point in California boasts some of the most dramatic holes in the world, playing over Pacific Ocean bays where seals bask on the rocks amid crashing waves. The course was styled by Alister MacKenzie \u2013 a renowned architect who also designed Augusta National, the lush and colorful Georgia setting for the annual Masters Tournament since 1934. Most golfers can only dream of setting foot on these courses, along with Pine Valley in New Jersey, often considered the most perfect example of golf architecture on land that \u2013 unlike the stunning natural beauty that awaits players at Trump International \u2013 was previously unremarkable. The notable exception to the top-ranked private clubs in the U.S. is Pebble Beach, the picturesque Californian coastal course which is a video-game favorite and open to the public. It\u2019s not cheap though, with a round costing $495 per person. One venue that every other struggles to compete with is St. Andrews\u2019 Old Course, which is at the top of every golfer\u2019s bucket list. It might not be the most dramatic or challenging course but it will always be the home of the game, where hard wooden balls were thrashed around wasteland almost six hundred years ago. Trump International cannot compete with the history of its Scottish neighbors and it won\u2019t echo the exclusivity and originality of some of its American cousins.  Unlike many of its iconic rivals, it has no \u201csignature\u201d hole, but is comprised of a series of stern but fair tests that will suit different players according to personal preference.  However, as it matures into its \u201cchampionship course\u201d billing with the backing of the professional game\u2019s organizers, it certainly has a fighting chance of one day becoming the most dramatic of tournament venues.

Staffordshire Police says it is the first force in the country to use the new technology with its dogs. The hi-tech digital camera will send back pictures to a color monitor watched by the dog\u2019s handlers. \u201cThis bit of kit is fantastic \u2013 it attaches to the dog\u2019s head and we can get a live view of what they are seeing,\u201d said Insp.

        "content": "Veteran cagefighter Usman Raja has so far worked to deradicalize 10 convicted terrorists after they completed their prison terms in the UK. His work combines teaching Mixed Martial Arts skills and a humanistic and tolerant interpretation of Islam that traces its roots back to the Prophet Mohammed. His success has been noted by British officials who are trying to work out if it can be replicated on a larger scale.  Read how Raja\u2019s controversial technique works, is changing lives, and getting noticed. Here are some of his cases: Abu Bakr Mansha, a British-Pakistani, who is now 28, was in 2005 convicted of terrorism in what prosecutors alleged was a thwarted plot he embarked on that year to track down and kill or severely harm a British soldier who had returned from Iraq. He had pleaded not guilty to a charge of possessing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism.  Mansha was released in 2009 under strict conditions but recalled to prison several months later because he was assessed as still dangerous. After he was again released in March 2011, he entrusted himself to Raja, under whose mentorship he appears to have shed his radical views. Mansha\u2019s police mug shot was used in British newspaper stories warning of a threat from released terrorist convicts to the Olympic Games. He says he now wants to stop other young Muslims from repeating his mistakes. \u201cI learned the hard way,\u201d he told CNN. Raja said his first terrorist case was Yassin Nassari, now 33, a British-Syrian resident of London, who was arrested by police after he landed in Luton airport in 2006 after a trip overseas. Police say they found instructions on how to make a viable rocket on his hard-drive, and at his home violent videos of terrorist attacks and beheadings. The following year Nassari was found guilty of possessing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism.  According to Raja, when he was released in 2008, Nassari was very reluctant to work with Muslim community groups enlisted by probation services to rehabilitate offenders. But Nassari heard about Raja through friends who had trained with him in mixed martial arts and agreed to meet him.  In the early summer of 2009 they met in a probation office in London and from there Nassari wanted to work with Raja.  He said Nassari was interested in getting mixed martial arts training, and the instruction he gave him in cage fighting allowed him to build up a mentoring relationship.  The two had wide-ranging discussions about Islam, during which time Raja was able to impress upon Nassari his humanistic approach to the religion. \u201cWhat I think he recognized was our sincerity - that we were doing this for the infinite good,\u201d Raja told CNN. The former convict is now working at a charity providing a support structure for Muslims convicted of criminal offenses after their release from prison, according to Raja. Andrew Rowe  Raja described how another one of his early success stories was Andrew Rowe, a  radicalized British-Jamaican convert who was 34 when convicted in 2005 of terrorism offenses after instructions on how to fire mortars, a coded list of methods of attack, possible targets, and traces of explosive were found on his possessions.  Rowe had travelled to several  Jihadist fronts, including Bosnia, Chechnya, Pakistan and Afghanistan and was described as \u201ca global terrorist [who] has been trained and knows how to use extreme violence,\u201d by a senior British counter-terrorism official.  Raja says Rowe began training on mixed martial arts whilst in prison. On his release Raja provided him with further martial arts instruction, which helped him forge a mentoring relationship. Raja said Rowe was already looking to improve his religious understanding, making him open to Raja\u2019s message. Other Cases  Raja has also worked with two men convicted of terrorism offenses  in relation to the failed July 21, 2005 bombing attack on London, a man convicted of a terrorist arson attack, as well as several other former terrorist convicts. He is set to take on several more released terrorist convicts in the coming months."

        "content": "In the shadow of London\u2019s Olympic stadium, home of the Summer Games, is a hotbed of radical fundamentalism dubbed Londonistan, from where al Qaeda has already recruited for some of its most ambitious plots. In past months, dozens of convicted terrorists have been released in the UK, including onto the same London streets. Seldom since 9/11 has al Qaeda, though weakened, had such an opportunity to create carnage on the global stage. At the same time a no-holds barred fight for security is under way. It is unorthodox, but British officials say it is working, producing results which have never been seen before \u2013 and at its epicenter is a veteran Muslim cagefighter. Over the last six months Usman Raja gave CNN exclusive access to his pioneering work; speaking for the first time about his work with former terrorists. In the past two years more than 50 convicted terrorists have been released from British jails after serving their sentences, producing a major headache for British security services. Read about some of Raja\u2019s success stories \u201cUnfortunately, we know that some of those prisoners are still committed extremists who are likely to return to their terrorist activities,\u201d Jonathan Evans, the director of British domestic intelligence service MI5, warned two years ago. The task of managing the re-integration into society of these young men has proved beyond the capabilities of most Muslim community groups. But one east Londoner, proud to be both British and Muslim, has felt religiously compelled to take on the fight. Raja, the 34-year-old grandson of a Pakistani immigrant is not tall but he is built like an ox, with a close shaven head, short beard, and otherwise pure muscle. On his thumb he wears a ring with a curving metal spike, a legal form of self-protection, which he says is extra insurance if extremists try to physically confront him. Raja is one of the UK\u2019s most renowned cage-fighting coaches, having fought in arenas across the UK during the early gritty years of the now fast growing sport, also known as mixed-martial arts (MMA). He is also a man of deep ideas, including harnessing Islamic teaching to defeat the ideology of the terrorists. Three years ago, Raja began taking under his wing some of the most dangerous offenders being released from the highest security wings of the British prison system; men convicted of carrying out terrorism on behalf of al Qaeda in murder, assassinations, bombing, and arson plots. His aim was to rehabilitate them into mainstream society. Last year pictures of several of the men appeared in full page splashes in British newspapers warning of the threat posed by released terrorists to the Olympics. \u201cGames Fear Over Evil Fanatics\u201d declared one headline. A \u2018humiliating\u2019 security failure The release of dozens of convicted terrorists was reflective of lower sentences under British law for a range of terrorist offenses, compared to the United States and some other countries.    Of the 250 convicted of terror offenses in the years after 9/11 relatively few received sentences of 15 years or more, says Michael Clarke, the Director General of the Royal United Services Institute and an advisor to the UK government on counter-terrorism.    Clarke told CNN that it was not unusual for terrorism suspects to be charged with more minor offenses than their plots merited, because British intelligence services were hesitant about intelligence emerging in court which could be useful to al Qaeda. Raja tried a novel approach with some of the most challenging freed convicted terrorists; he coached them cage-fighting skills. Raja says it proved a remarkably effective way of breaking them out of their pro al Qaeda mentality and opening up their minds to his counter-extremist message. It has almost literally involved knocking sense into them in the fighting gym. Convicted terrorist calmed by cagefighting When the released convicts meet Raja to train in gyms in and around the capital, including one in east London within sight of the Olympic park, they are very much on his territory. Sparring in the cage, he says, has a way of focusing the mind. \u201cAny idea you\u2019ve got of yourself will be challenged as soon as you come in here,\u201d Raja said. \u201cOnce that idea of yourself is challenged and that opening happens we are able to go in and start dismantling that perception.\u201d He says he has used cage-fighting sessions in about one-third of his intervention cases. As well as working with released convicted terrorists he has worked with dozens of young Muslims radicalized in jail. The MMA gym, he says, has been a big draw for the previously jailed terrorists, for whom physical training was both an outlet and a form of protection in prison. And he says his coaching naturally allows him to develop a mentoring relationship. Once he has their attention, he impresses on them that true Islam is spiritual, tolerant and humanistic, and not the narrow-minded, divisive message of hate peddled by self-serving radical preachers. \u201cI try to unravel their Jihadist identity. Previously that identity was being validated. I say to them let\u2019s question that validity,\u201d Raja said. That identity, Raja says, is the result of a \u201cdeviant Jihadist subculture\u201d that has been accepted by too many young British Muslims which justifies all manner of criminal activity, including terrorism, out of hostility to the British state. Read Raja\u2019s path to anti-terror inspiration British officials say Raja\u2019s approach is working. The former cagefighter has worked with 10 of the dozens of convicted terrorists released from prison and says that his approach has been successful so far in every single case. \u201cHe\u2019s the most successful guy out there doing this sort of work,\u201d said a UK Home Office official, aware of Raja\u2019s work but who did not want to be named given the sensitivity of ongoing cases. \u201cHe has that ability to inspire; that personality X-factor.\u201d Clarke told CNN: \u201cRaja\u2019s 100% success rate is based on his own skill, his acknowledged skill, his understanding of what people are motivated by but also because he has got the time, effort and commitment to spend on individual people.\u201d The Probation Service\u2019s Central Extremism Unit, the lead UK government agency dealing with released terrorist convicts, now regularly channels cases towards Raja. The young men are not required to meet him, but are encouraged to do so. Other terrorist convicts up for release, having heard about his work, reach out to him directly. Several of those Raja is working with are still considered potentially dangerous. But Raja knows how to connect. Like several of them, he is also from the tough neighborhoods of east London, once subscribed to fundamentalist views himself, and says he came close to fighting Jihad in Bosnia in the 1990s. \u201cThey see someone who is coming from the same type of background who can understand what may have brought them to the place they are in,\u201d Raja told CNN. Raja says they are impressed by his martial arts pedigree and sense he sincerely wants to help them. What adds to his credibility is that he has not been beholden financially to the British government. Almost all his work is self-financed under the auspices of the Unity Initiative, an organization which he runs with his wife and a small band of helpers. Funds have been so scarce he says he finances the work from his cage-fighting coaching and his wife\u2019s student loans. Check out CNN\u2019s Security Clearance But theological fire-power also has a crucial role in his success. When he and his wife Khadija founded Unity in August 2009 they created a systematic approach for working with radicalized Muslims, which they based on the teachings of Raja\u2019s guru Sheikh Aleey Qadir, a Malaysian cleric resident in east London from a school of Islamic learning that says it traces its lineage of learning directly to the Prophet Mohammed. The cleric\u2019s backing has provided crucial religious legitimacy to their efforts and Qadir has played a hands-on role supporting Unity, including counseling several of the released men. One of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Wael Zubi, a young British-Libyan theologian, is also an instrumental volunteer member of Unity. \u201cI don\u2019t look at it as de-radicalization. What we are doing here is a 1,400-year-old methodology,\u201d Raja told CNN. \u201cThe reason they haven\u2019t slipped back is because of the legitimacy of the message. You can\u2019t argue if you say through my teacher we have a lineage going all the way through Islam back to Prophet Mohammed,\u201d Raja added. While he focuses on the men, Khadija, a Hindu convert to Islam, is working with young women who have become radicalized, including some released from jail after being convicted in terrorism cases. One was convicted in connection to a failed London bombing attack. Often the Rajas work in tandem: he works to de-radicalize the husband, she to change the views of the wife. Sometimes when radicalized men are reluctant to meet Raja, Khadija has been able to reach out to their wives. \u201cYou have to have a joined up approach,\u201d said Khadija, who has a beaming optimism and eloquence. \u201cI really believe the women aspect has been totally overlooked mainly through short sightedness because that is where the future of this is going to be with the children, with the mothers.\u201d The stakes in Raja\u2019s work are high because if those being released from prison maintain their radical views they could become magnets for pro al Qaeda extremists. Michael Clarke, the UK government counter-terrorism advisor, said: \u201cThe biggest problem we have with radicals coming out of prison is not that they will commit another act but they will act as an inspiration for clean skins \u2013 people who have not committed terrorist acts in the past \u2013 to then go and do something.\u201d He added: \u201cThe fact that we have the Olympics in 2012 was never thought about when people were being locked up for terrorist offences in 2005 or 2006 and there is no way under the British system you can keep them in prison because the Olympics is on.\u201d The east London neighborhoods just beyond the Olympic village are where a significant number of the ex-con terrorists call home. The al Qaeda cell that plotted to bring down nine transatlantic airliners in 2006 planned their operation from these streets, as did the ringleader of a 2010 plot to target the London Stock Exchange and other London buildings. In late June, two east London Muslim converts were arrested on suspicion of plotting an attack against the Olympics canoeing venue, but were subsequently released without charge. Earlier this month seven London residents, including three brothers in the Olympic area of Stratford, were arrested in an ongoing investigation into a suspected terrorist plot.  Three of those arrested, including one of those living in Stratford, were charged Wednesday with preparing for acts of terrorism. At least one of those arrested in July was a follower of one of Britain\u2019s most notorious Islamist extremist groups,  which is based in the east London area, and whose followers openly sympathize with al Qaeda. Some of them have been tied to terrorist plots to bomb London.  Known for many years as Al Muhajiroun, the organization has operated under a variety of names in recent years because of successive British government bans, but is still active. In recent weeks followers have been distributing radical leaflets outside the London Underground stop adjacent to the Olympics. The group\u2019s controversial leading figure is Anjem Choudary, 45, a British-Pakistani from east London, who trained as a lawyer and has been careful to stay on the right side of the law. Several of the recently released terrorist convicts, including at least one Raja is working with, moved in al Muhajiroun circles before their arrest, and the concern is they may be drawn back. Choudary told CNN he believes militants who have already served prison time may be more difficult to deter and he insists that terrorist convicts are an inspiration even before they get out of jail. \u201cThey have a huge amount of respect in prison. People want to listen to them, people want to embrace Islam at their hands,\u201d stressed Choudary. Raja is under no illusion of the challenge as he takes on new cases and visits convicted terrorists in some of Britain\u2019s highest security jails. \u201cThey are in a reactionary mind-set. Some of them are very angry,\u201d he told CNN. Raja says if Unity can successfully expand the model, it may be possible to wean a generation away from the lure of extremism. But fail and the potential for terrorist attacks in the UK could increase and tensions grow between Muslim communities and mainstream British society. Clarke, the government advisor, says the scale of the challenge means that Raja can only be part of the solution. \u201cThere is no question the Unity Initiative is known for its success, and of course all credit to it for that, but that success is at very low numbers, and the sheer commitment of time for every single individual being addressed means the initiative would have to be much wider. You\u2019d have to do it on an industrial scale to have any hope of success,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cThe numbers defeat you \u2013 if the numbers we are talking about being radicalized are in the hundreds, the numbers being de-radicalized are in the dozens,\u201d Clarke added. \u201cWhat is not clear is the degree to which it depends on his inspirational personality: the question is can it be scaled up?\u201d a UK Home Office official told CNN.  Usman and Khadija Raja are looking for backing from British Muslim businessmen and other donors for funding because they believe it is important to keep autonomy from the British government. They believe that if they can get more backing over time they can build up the efforts of Unity significantly, and provide others around the world a blueprint to rehabilitate even the most extreme of Islamist militants. \u201cThere is a real problem here and it\u2019s growing and it would be incredibly sad that we have the cure and then it\u2019s not delivered and it\u2019s not given the platform it needs to be dispersed. At the end of the day I\u2019m still a mother and I don\u2019t want to live a world where there is this very real fear,\u201d Khadija Raja told CNN. "

In Friday\u2019s dryer first session, McLaren\u2019s Jenson Button led teammate Lewis Hamilton at the top of the time sheets.  Seven-time champion Michael Schumacher had a day to forget at Hockenheim, crashing his Mercedes into a wall in the final few minutes of the second session.  The German driver, known for his ability to handle wet track conditions, had been going well at his home race.  \u201cThe way I ended the second session was obviously not part of the plan,\u201d Schumacher told the official website.  \u201cI simply slid off track because I lost a little concentration, we were talking on the radio and I was altering some settings at the same time. \u201cOverall the session went ok. I think that qualifying will probably be wet tomorrow, so today\u2019s weather was useful in that respect.\u201d The Mercedes team suffered a miserable end to the day as it was confirmed that Schumacher\u2019s teammate Nico Rosberg will start five places back from his qualifying position as punishment for replacing his gearbox.  Defending World Champion Sebastien Vettel enjoyed a much improved second session. The German moved from twelfth in the morning to third in the afternoon. \u201cWe just got used to the conditions, as there may be rain tomorrow and also on Sunday. The forecast isn\u2019t looking great,\u201d he told the Formula 1 website.  Vettel\u2019s Red Bull teammate Mark Webber described the conditions as \u201cunreal\u201d, as he endured a mixed day. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect the rain to be this bad today, but it was quite heavy at times - we even used the extreme full wet tire,\u201d the Australian, who won the previous grand prix at Silverstone, told the official website.  \u201cThat\u2019s two races in a row now with tricky conditions.\u201d Current championship leader Fernando Alonso was happy with the way his car handled the conditions. The Ferrari driver, who has won two races this season declared himself \u201cpleased with how things went.\u201d \u201cThe car behaved well in all conditions, which is always a good thing and we were also able to see how the various types of tire worked.\u201d McLaren unveiled a number of upgrades to their car as they attempt to rescue a disappointing season. Former world champions Button and Hamilton rewarded their team\u2019s efforts with a good first practice session.   \u201cThe men and women back at the factory did an incredible job to get all the upgrades to the track this weekend. It\u2019s definitely a step forward,\u201d Hamilton told the official website.  \u201cThe car doesn\u2019t feel bad at all. It\u2019s tough in the wet out there, like driving around on an ice rink, but I feel positive that we can do something good this weekend.\u201d Button echoed Hamilton\u2019s comments, as he declared to the official website that the team can be happy with the new parts, \u201cmost of them worked correctly - so it\u2019s nice to see the improvement. I want to say a big \u2018well done\u2019 to the guys at the factory.\u201d The weather forecast suggests the track will be damp for qualifying tomorrow, with similar conditions likely for the race on Sunday.

Nadal, gold medallist four years ago in Beijing admitted he was \u201cnot in the right physical condition to compete\u201d and that he had to \u201cthink about Spanish sport.\u201d  The world number two, who was due to carry Spain\u2019s flag at the opening ceremony, had already taken two weeks off in the buildup to the Olympics to recover from tendinitis in his knee  \u201cI\u2019ve waited until the final moment of my preparation and my training, but I cannot do it,\u201d Nadal said in a statement released to the Spanish press on Thursday.  \u201cToday is one of the saddest days in my career. Carrying the flag for Spain at the opening ceremony was set to be one of the biggest honors, one of the most special moments for me. \u201cFor this reason I hope you can understand how difficult it has been for me to take this decision. One of my teammates who is better prepared than me can take my place and compete to the best of his ability.\u201d The Spanish Tennis Federation announced that world number 30 Feliciano Lopez would take Nadal\u2019s spot in the singles competition. Marc Lopez, who has won doubles titles with Nadal on the ATP tour, will take his place in the doubles competition.  The Spanish Olympic Federation have chosen basketball star Pau Gasol as the new flag bearer.   Former world number one Nadal recorded his 11th grand slam win at June\u2019s French Open, but crashed out of Wimbledon in the second round to unfancied Czech player Lukas Rosol.  Nadal had only two weeks to make the transition from the clay courts of Roland Garros to Wimbledon\u2019s grass courts, but in future he will have longer to adapt. Wimbledon organizers announced on Thursday that from 2015 there will be an extra week between the two slams. \u201cThe best interests of tennis will be served by allowing the players more time to recuperate and to adjust from the clay of Roland Garros to the grass at Wimbledon,\u201d said All England Club chairman Philip Brook. \u201cWe think most players welcome the prospect of a longer grass court season and spending more time on the softer surface of grass. \u201cIn making this change from 2015 we recognize that there will be some important consequences for the overall tennis calendar, and enough time needs to be given to allow us all to plan accordingly.\u201d "

        "content": "Forget the extreme environmental campaigns involving chaining oneself to an oil refinery or egging local politicians. The next big thing of environmental campaigning? Aesthetics.  A group of 20 artists decided to step away from slogans and campaigns and unveiled a sculpture exhibition designed to make suggestions, rather than demands. Called \u201cPertaining to Things Natural\u201d the show at London\u2019s Chelsea Physic Garden puts together art pieces that respond to the environment and the current ecological debates.  Cathy Ward and Eric Wright are among the artists involved in the show. Their sculpture \u201cSkyfield\u201d addresses the issue of sustainability.  \u201cAs populations expand, pressure increases to produce more food on the limited and shrinking land that is available for cultivation,\u201d Ward explains.  \u201cScientific advances in the genetics of plants as well as increased knowledge on the effects of diet on health are opening new and vital debates on our future,\u201d she says.  Her bright pink, double deck structure might not convey that message straight away, but a closer look shows that the sculpture could be used as a corn grower, suggesting a solution to the lack of cultivated land.  James P. Graham\u2019s  \u201cGolden Cage\u201d is one of those more metaphoric pieces. The cage-like structure of volcanic rocks wrapped in gold wire symbolizes man\u2019s \u201cattempts to imprison and control nature,\u201d a much discussed theme within the environmental debate. The connection between art and environment is not a new one. From the pioneer Friedensreich Hundertwasser, who designed underground highways lined by trees and rooftop gardens, to sculptures made of recycled materials, creative souls have long tried to send out the environmental message.  But this latest addition to the dialog between art and environment carries more subtle message.  Sculptor Michael Shaw installed large inflatable balloons on trees.  \u201cThere is no \u2018Greenpeace message\u2019 in the piece,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it relates to environment, it is responsive to it. Where the sculpture is depends on the wind.\u201d The curator of the show, David Worthington, says this is the way art can add to the environmental debate \u2013 even without straightforward messages.  \u201cWe can affect people\u2019s consciousness about environment on intellectual level, through campaigns and information,\u201d he says and points out environmental groups around the world.  \u201cBut we can also do it on emotional level through art and creativity,\u201d he says. \u201cThe emotional level is more powerful.\u201d"

        "content": "It is an unwritten rule in soccer \u2013 once you nail your colors to the mast you must never even think about switching allegiances. But for one diehard UK football fan, his disillusionment with his beloved club is so great he is offering his support to the highest bidder on eBay. \u201cWith selling history and tradition the latest trend within football, I have decided to get on the bandwagon,\u201d writes lifelong Cardiff City fan Ben Dudley on his eBay page. The straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for Dudley was the decision by the Welsh team\u2019s Malaysian owners to rebrand the club by insisting they play in red rather than their traditional blue to boost their appeal to Asian audiences. So much so that Dudley is willing to trade his dedication to the Bluebirds\u2019 cause to whoever stumps up the most cash in the internet auction, whether it is Premier League champions Manchester City or lowly Ross County in the far north of Scotland. Can PSG\u2019s big bucks buy world football domination? \u201cIt feels like the club have abandoned their local supporters,\u201d Dudley told CNN. \u201cWhile they play in red with a dragon on the badge I\u2019ve had my season ticket refunded and I\u2019m not going to go to anymore games until they\u2019ve reversed the branding. \u201cI believe the board has thrown away the club\u2019s history on a gamble that is not guaranteed to make any money anyway. They don\u2019t understand the idea behind Cardiff being the Bluebirds and playing in blue. Cardiff have played in blue since 1908.\u201d The rebranding move was met with outrage by supporters of the club, who play in the second tier of the English league, when it was announced last month. Cardiff\u2019s Malaysian owners said the marketing exercise was part of a significant investment package that would help secure the club\u2019s immediate financial future after a debt-laden few years and help broaden their appeal in \u201cinternational markets.\u201d The club\u2019s chief executive Alan Whiteley acknowledged it would not be a universally popular plan and Dudley is living proof that resentment is still simmering. \u201cI\u2019ve had a season ticket for the last nine years and I go to most away games as well so it wasn\u2019t something I have taken lightly, but the thought of watching Cardiff play in red at home wasn\u2019t something I could live with,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the players come out or we score a goal we all chant \u2018Bluebirds\u2019 and obviously the bluebird has now been replaced by a dragon.  \u201cThe nickname is the Bluebirds but the team will now be playing in red. It will look silly, a stadium of blue seats, fans in blue shirts and a team playing in red.\u201d But after following Cardiff the length and breadth of the country last season, when he watched his team in action 51 times, is he not apprehensive of the distance he might be required to travel to back his new team?  \u201cIt would be a bit of a trek up to Newcastle (some 322 miles away). I\u2019m just hoping someone from Sydney FC doesn\u2019t see it and try to sign me up. \u201cA non-league team would be good but our local rivals Swansea and Bristol fans can\u2019t buy me \u2013 anyone apart from that is fine.\u201d The fan is dead, long live the phone? However, it\u2019s not just Cardiff\u2019s rebranding initiative that has upset Dudley. Aggrieved at the change football has undergone in recent years, with the huge amounts of money sloshing around the game through TV and sponsorship deals leading to exorbitant wages for players and a big increase in foreign owners, Dudley argues the sport is unrecognizable from the game he started to follow as a teenager. \u201cI wasn\u2019t around in the 1970s or 1980s but people who knew football at that time wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize the sport now and see the wages players are on. It\u2019s not the sport I loved when I was 14 and started to go to Cardiff games,\u201d he added. \u201cFans aren\u2019t really the priority in football anymore; it is all about money and trying to make money from TV deals. I think (the owners) are trying to get a TV deal in Malaysia to show all our games as part of the whole making Cardiff the team of choice for Malaysia. \u201cThey said the color red is marketable in Asia, they think Asian fans and Malaysian fans won\u2019t care about Cardiff in a blue shirt but if they play in red at home they will suddenly take Cardiff as their team instead of Real Madrid or Barcelona. It doesn\u2019t seem very likely to me.\u201d Bidding for Dudley\u2019s football soul is currently running at over $300, which has come as something of a shock to him. \u201cWith the price going far beyond anything I had expected, this is now a full charity auction. 50% will go to Help for Heroes charity and 50% to the Ty Hafan charity. The only money I will take from this auction is enough to pay the eBay fees.\u201d"

        "content": "Australian golfer Adam Scott took the first-round lead at the British Open after carding a spectacular six-under-par 64 on Thursday, narrowly missing out on making history.  The world No. 13 looked set to card the first 62 in a major championship after eight birdies in his first 17 holes but a bogey at the last meant he had to settle for the lowest opening round in an Open championship at Royal Lytham & St. Annes and matching the overall course record.  The 31-year-old finished the day one shot ahead of Scotland\u2019s 1999 British Open champion Paul Lawrie, in-form 2007 Masters winner Zach Johnson \u2013 who won on his last PGA Tour start to earn a place in the field \u2013 and Belgium\u2019s Nicholas Colsaerts. Why U.S. golf has a healthy future Three time British Open champion Tiger Woods finished three shots behind Scott, tied for fifth, after a mixed opening round in his bid to win his first major since 2008.  The 14-time major winner was joined on three under by 2002 British Open champion Ernie Els, former U.S. Open winners Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell plus reigning Masters champion Bubba Watson.   British Open leaderboard The buildup to the tournament was dominated by talk of the playing conditions, as Woods described the course as \u201calmost unplayable\u201d after his first practice round due to its thick rough.  However, after several days of strong wind and heavy rain, benign conditions allowed the players to attack the English links course. \u201cIt was like a walk in the park today, and not like what we\u2019ve been experiencing in the practice rounds,\u201d Scott told the official website. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s going to be some weather elements thrown at us the next three days so I\u2019m just going to have to knuckle down and handle that.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m confident. My ball striking is good and I think I can get round no matter what the conditions are.\u201d  Woods was leading the field before Scott began his impressive run, as the American reached four under after seven holes \u2013 but he missed several birdie putts and dropped a shot on the 15th.  \u201cIt was a good start,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI hit the ball well all day but just lacked a bit of pace on the greens coming home. Every putt was right on line, they were dying off the front of the lip. \u201cI played practice rounds on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and they were completely different clubs based on the winds. \u201cI was shaping the golf ball both ways. Sometimes I rode the wind; sometimes I held it against it.\u201d British hope McIlroy also endured a mixed opening round. The Northern Irishman was going well on three under when he suffered a double bogey on 15. His tee shot struck a spectator and rolled out of bounds, forcing him to return to the tee.  The former world number one picked up two birdies from the remaining three holes to pull himself level with tournament favorite Woods.  \u201cIt was an eventful last four holes. Everything was going along pretty nicely,\u201d the 2011 U.S. Open winner said. \u201cI hit it slightly right and got an unfortunate break. I thought I did well to keep my composure after that. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize there was an out of bounds over there. It went 20 yards off his head. He could have headed it the other way! \u201cThe most important thing was that he was okay and the birdie at 18 will make dinner taste very nice.\u201d World number one Luke Donald ended the day on level par after a subdued round. A birdie at the par-four third proved the highlight, while the Englishman dropped a shot on the final hole to be tied for 33rd.  Defending champion Darren Clarke had a miserable opening round, finishing on six over par. Clarke has been out of form since his victory and, bar a birdie at the 10th, the veteran Northern Irisdman showed no sign of last year\u2019s winning form.  \u201cI played poorly and I putted worse. It was very disappointing because at practice I hit really, really well,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cBasically, I\u2019m disgusted with myself.\u201d  World No. 3 Lee Westwood, still seeking his first major win, failed to live up to pre-tournament hopes as he ended on three over par. A double bogey on the third and five more dropped shots ended the Englishman\u2019s chances of threatening the top of the leaderboard.  The forecast is for a mostly clear day on Friday, which should help the leaders continue their impressive start to the championship. "

        "content": "Two of the world\u2019s top golfers have backed the R & A\u2019s decision to embrace technology by allowing spectators to bring mobile phones into this week\u2019s British Open. The R & A, golf\u2019s rulemakers outside of the United States and Mexico and organizers of the sport\u2019s oldest major, have relented on a ban on phones which had been in place since 2006. World No. 3 Lee Westwood, searching for his first triumph in one of golf\u2019s four majors in front of his home fans, says the ban was unrealistic in the modern age. \u201cWe live in times when the mobile phone is a key tool in business affairs so I think we might deter people from attending if there is a ban,\u201d the 39-year-old, who has over 450,000 followers on Twitter, said in quotes released to CNN ahead of the 141st British Open. \u201cObviously you don\u2019t want them ringing when you are about to take a shot, but in general golf followers tend to be mindful of a player\u2019s needs.\u201d Australia\u2019s Adam Scott has also backed the R & A\u2019s decision, but warned that fans will need to use their phones responsibly. \u201cCell phones or smart phones are a part of life these days,\u201d said the world No.13 ahead of the tournament at The Royal Lytham and St. Annes Golf Club on England\u2019s west coast. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with it. I just hope all spectators at the Open are considerate towards the players and put them on silent.\u201d R & A head of communications Malcolm Booth explained how mobile phone use will only be allowed in specific zones, and that the move is part of the British Open welcoming new technology. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely something we\u2019re embracing,\u201d Booth told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re not na\u00efve or blind to the potential issues it could cause or the challenges which come with this policy.  \u201cBut we\u2019re excited our spectators will have access to more information than they\u2019ve ever had on a golf course before. That can only heighten the experience of the Open championship.\u201d The subject of mobile phone use during golf tournaments was raised after both four-time major winner Phil Mickelson and 2012 Masters champion Bubba Watson complained of spectators taking pictures during June\u2019s Memorial Tournament. Despite the complaints from high-profile players, PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem outlined how no ban on phones at events would be implemented. Booth is hoping new technology designed for the British Open, which was won by Northern Ireland\u2019s Darren Clarke in 2011, will enhance the spectator experience. \u201cNew for this year we have an ipad application,\u201d added Booth. \u201cAllowing our spectators to have handheld devices on the golf course allows them to have up-to-the-minute scores.  \u201cThere is a new course guide we have for this year which uses GPS technology to show spectators and people who aren\u2019t at the event exactly where different groups are on the golf course.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re also going to have live coverage available in the UK through our apps, which is an exciting development.\u201d The first round of the British Open tees off on Thursday, with the champion being crowned on Sunday.

        "content": "Even at the age of 82 the work ethic still burns bright in Arnold Palmer, the man who inspired a generation of baby-boomers to take up golf and whose support of the British Open proved pivotal for its future success. The elite of world golf gather at Royal Lytham and St. Annes this week on the 50th anniversary of Palmer\u2019s crushing victory at Scottish links course Troon in 1962 \u2013 and \u201cThe King\u201d still exerts a significant influence on the sport he once dominated.     \u201cI would like to be remembered for bringing golf to a worldwide audience,\u201d Palmer told CNN. \u201cPlayers today have no boundaries.\u201d   As part of golf\u2019s \u201cBig Three,\u201d Palmer helped pioneering player agent Mark McCormack take the sport around the globe in the 1960s, capitalizing on the ever-growing reach of television. Why U.S. golf has a healthy future The tournament Palmer still proudly hosts in the last week of March, at his Bay Hill course in Florida, attracts a stellar international lineup and was won this year by Tiger Woods.  He is a very hands-on host, making sure the course is in top condition and appearing daily on the television coverage of the event. This year, he suffered a health scare after leaving the TV tower on the final day  \u2013 a blood pressure problem, according to his family \u2013 and could not give out the prizes as has been tradition. But Palmer has made a full recovery and now, half century on from his second British Open triumph, the spotlight has again fallen on his trailblazing achievements. A leader of men When he first played golf\u2019s oldest tournament in 1960, it had fallen out of favor with American pros. Ben Hogan in 1953 was the last from the U.S. to win it, and only three entered in 1959 \u2013 put off by the long journey and comparatively low prize money on offer. Again there were only three Americans in the 74-man field at St. Andrews, one being the legendary Gene Sarazen \u2013 still playing late into his 50s on a lifetime exemption dating back to his 1932 success. Palmer failed to emulate Hogan\u2019s triple-major feat, falling one shot short of Kel Nagle following earlier victories at the Masters and U.S. Open, but  he returned to the UK the next year and claimed the coveted \u201cClaret Jug\u201d at Royal Birkdale. Palmer had already won his third Masters crown before romping to victory at Troon in 1962. \u201cI got it going in the final round and it was very enjoyable,\u201d he told CNN.  Ever modest, Palmer\u2019s margin of victory over Nagle was six shots and he was a remarkable 13 strokes clear of third place. His 1961 exploits had inspired a young Jack Nicklaus to make his British Open debut at Troon, and the \u201cGolden Bear\u201d won it for the first time in 1966 \u2013 two years after compatriot Tony Lema also triumphed at St. Andrews. By then Palmer had been represented by McCormack for several years, and their partnership helped changed the face of golf and modern sports.  Famous deal McCormack was a Cleveland attorney, only a year older than Palmer, and they famously struck their deal in 1960 with just a handshake. McCormack had seen his client\u2019s potential, and the increased television coverage of golf was extending his appeal to a wider audience. \u201cHe was very smart. He was a motivator and went after it, and that was something I enjoyed,\u201d recalled Palmer. McCormack later persuaded Nicklaus and South Africa\u2019s Gary Player to join Palmer at his International Management Group (IMG) and the \u201cBig Three\u201d was born, popularizing golf worldwide in a series of made-for-television events. But Palmer held a very special place in the affections of the golfing galleries and it is easy to see why with his attacking play and flamboyant style. He was the first golfer to attract his own special following \u2013 \u201cArnie\u2019s Army\u201d \u2013 diehard fans who surrounded every green to cheer him on, win or lose.  Woods in his pomp had a similar fan base decades later, but Palmer was the first and he appreciated their support. \u201cThey only encouraged me to continue to do the things I was doing and gave me the confidence I needed,\u201d he said. Charismatic star  But it was not only his fine play which drew them in. He had that \u201csomething\u201d \u2013 an aura, charisma combined with good looks. A hitch of his tightly fitting pants followed most shots, and his stylish outfits made him stand out from the average pro. \u201cIt was not something I really planned,\u201d Palmer admitted. \u201cI liked a sharp crease in my slacks, my shoes polished to shine, while my shirts were conservative with a straight collar. \u201cIt was a style I stuck with for most of my career.\u201d Intentional or not, it has proved popular. GQ Magazine named him one of the \u201c50 most stylish men of the past 50 years\u201d and Esquire had him in a list of the \u201c75 best-dressed men of all time.\u201d Golfers are rarely remembered for their fashion sense, usually the exact opposite, but the outfits he wore in 1962 have been recreated for a new range of Arnie Apparel. Palmer wanted promising PGA Tour player Ryan Moore to don the outfits \u2013 \u201cI took a particular liking to him when he won the U.S. Amateur, a very polite young man\u201d \u2013 and he has got his wish. Moore has won once on the lucrative U.S. calendar, in 2009, but if he can achieve a fraction of Palmer\u2019s achievements in golf, he will count himself lucky.  Seven major wins, 62 in all on the PGA Tour, not to mention his later exploits on the Seniors circuit \u2013 which he more than any other golfer helped publicize and give legitimacy to the idea of golfers aged 50 plus still competing at the top level. Endorsing success With the business acumen of McCormack promoting his off-course activities, Palmer lent his image to a host of products and services, becoming the first sportsman to show that income from commercial endorsements could outstrip prize-money earnings. \u201cMark was very good at marketing,\u201d Palmer said, and where he led, others were quick to follow. With the \u201cBig Three\u201d dominating golf, McCormack branched out into other sports such as tennis and then into the world of showbiz. He even marketed a papal tour of Britain in 1982. By the time McCormack died in 2003, IMG was the most powerful sports marketing company in the world and had Woods as its star client. Palmer\u2019s own commercial activities have helped him amass an estimated $675 million fortune, which is still growing despite his retirement from competitive golf in 2006.  He is proud of his legacy on and off the course, and is optimistic for the future, particularly with golf winning inclusion to the 2016 Olympics in Rio. \u201cWe will see more Third World countries participating. I think that\u2019s important, and we will see interest getting to the point when we can rival soccer and tennis,\u201d he predicted. Palmer may well get his wish, but he has already forged his place in golfing history as a true trailblazer.     "

        "content": "The lifetime ban imposed by global governing body FIFA on the former head of Asian football has been annulled. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld Mohamed bin Hammam\u2019s appeal against the punishment handed to him after being found guilty of bribery by FIFA\u2019s ethics committee in July 2011. The Qatari was accused of issuing bribes to members of the Caribbean Football Union (CFU), including former North American soccer head Jack Warner, in exchanges for votes during his ill-fated FIFA presidential campaign against current chief Sepp Blatter. The CAS decision to lift the sanction imposed on Bin Hammam was based on a lack of evidence, though the body stressed the 63-year-old had not been found innocent. \u201cThis conclusion should not be taken to diminish the significance of its finding that it is more likely than not that Mr. Bin Hammam was the source of the monies that were brought into Trinidad and Tobago and eventually distributed at the meeting by Mr Warner,\u201d said the CAS statement. \u201cHis conduct, in collaboration with and most likely induced by Mr Warner, may not have complied with the highest ethical standards that should govern the world of football and other sports. \u201cThe panel is doing no more than concluding that the evidence is insufficient in that it does not permit the majority of the panel to reach the standard of comfortable satisfaction in relation to the matters on which the Appellant was charged. \u201cIt is a situation of \u2018case not proven\u2019, coupled with concern on the part of the panel that the FIFA investigation was not complete or comprehensive enough to fill the gaps in the record.\u201d The CAS verdict was greeted with unease by FIFA. \u201cFIFA has noted with concern the decision announced today by CAS in the Mohamed Bin Hammam case,\u201d read a statement from the Zurich-based body, which recently appointed two crimefighters as part of ongoing reforms aimed at improving the organization\u2019s governance. Former United States attorney Michael J Garcia and German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert have been put in place to tackle the allegations of wrongdoing which have plagued FIFA in recent years. \u201cThe CAS panel notes that \u2018FIFA was in the process of reforming its ethics committee and that, in the event new evidence relating to the present case was discovered, it would be possible to re-open the case, in order to complete the factual background properly and to establish if Mr Bin Hammam has committed any violation of the FIFA Code of Ethics,\u2019\u201d added FIFA\u2019s statement. Earlier this week, Bin Hammam was provisionally suspended by the Asian Football Confederation, the organization of which he was president between 2002 and 2011, following an audit of the body\u2019s accounts. The suspension related to payments in and out of AFC bank accounts during Bin Hammam\u2019s tenure."

        "content": "McLaren team boss Martin Whitmarsh expects Lewis Hamilton to extend his stay with the Formula One marque, despite his contract expiring at the end of the current season. The 2008 world champion has been at McLaren for the entirety of his F1 career but has expressed his disappointment at the performance of the team\u2019s car this campaign. Hamilton has just one grand prix win to his name in 2012 \u2013 in Canada \u2013 and trails drivers\u2019 championship leader Fernando Alonso, from Ferrari, by 37 points. But despite speculation linking the 27-year-old with a move away, Whitmarsh says McLaren and Hamilton are entirely relaxed about his situation. Marussia F1: Car was not a factor in De Villota crash \u201cI think we will (agree a new deal),\u201d Whitmarsh told the sport\u2019s official website. \u201cWe\u2019ve known Lewis a long time.\u201d Whitmarsh rejected the notion that poor performances from McLaren in the next two Formula One races \u2013 in Germany and Hungary \u2013 would strengthen Hamilton\u2019s negotiating position. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to the next two races to try and win, as we do with every race,\u201d he added. \u201cI think Lewis is more intelligent than that and I hope the same applies to the media.\u201d After finishing eighth in his home grand prix at Silverstone Hamilton said McLaren needed a quick change in fortunes if they were to stay in the world title race. But faced with the prospect of going through a fourth F1 season without adding to his solitary drivers\u2019 championship crown, Hamilton has been linked with a move away from the team. Whitmarsh said that although speculation in the media had reached fever pitch, McLaren were focused on the rest of the season and not Hamilton\u2019s contract. \u201cWe have been concentrating on the season and I think there has been more speculation, more concern and more interest about Lewis\u2019s situation in the media than there has been perhaps within the team or within Lewis\u2019s mind,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are often asked questions about it but I don\u2019t think it occupies as much time in our minds as it does in column inches. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should put any timeframe on it. I think it\u2019s something that\u2019s got to be determined for both parties preferably before the end of the season. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need to do so against any tight timeframe for that resolution.\u201d Both Hamilton and his teammate Jenson Button have cut dejected figures at times as they have struggled to keep pace with the likes of Alonso and Red Bull pair Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber. But Whitmarsh says there will be a range of improvements to the car for the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim this weekend. \u201cOur focus is always to keep developing the car,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe will have quite a lot of quite noticeable updates on the car in Germany.  \u201cI think for everyone, not just McLaren, trying to understand how to work the tires correctly is quite a substantial challenge.  \u201cSo eliminating mistakes, improving the performance of our car and understanding the tires and seeing if we can exploit them better are all on the top of our to-do list.\u201d"

        "content": "A bus bombing that killed five Israeli tourists, the bus driver and the suspected bomber in Bulgaria was probably carried out by a male suicide attacker who had a fake Michigan driver\u2019s license, Bulgaria\u2019s interior minister said Thursday. Israel said it suspects Iran or an Islamist militant group was behind the attack, which occurred Wednesday in a parking lot outside Burgas International Airport in Bulgaria. Tensions between Israel and Tehran have been escalating in recent months. Explainer: Explosion comes amid growing tension In a televised statement Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attack was \u201cperpetrated by Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s leading terrorist proxy,\u201d as part of a global campaign that has reached a dozen countries on five continents. But he offered no evidence. Israel\u2019s U.S. Embassy said Wednesday that it had no proof that Iran was the instigator of the attack. Netanyahu said Hezbollah and Iran have been trying to foment terrorism in countries that include Kenya, India and Cyprus, as well as in the United States, where an Iranian tried to kill the Saudi diplomat. He urged world powers to expose Iran as \u201cthe premier terrorist-supporting state that it is\u201d and prevent it from developing \u201cthe world\u2019s most dangerous weapons,\u201d a reference to its nuclear program. \u201cWe will continue to fight against the terrorists and exact a heavy price from those that support them,\u201d Netanyahu said. Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, said Israel was engaging in \u201cbaseless accusations against other countries in order to distract the attention of the international community from its terrorist activities being carried out throughout the world,\u201d according to a statement from the state-run IRNA news agency. \u201cThe Zionist regime as master of state and organized terrorism has its hands in (the) blood of innocent Lebanese, Palestinian and other nationalities,\u201d Mehmanparast said. The Iranian Embassy in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, said earlier that Israeli suggestions that Tehran was involved in Wednesday\u2019s attack were \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d and that the assertion was politically motivated. The identity of the man thought to have put a backpack bomb on the bus remained a mystery, but he was carrying a Michigan driver\u2019s license that FBI officials say was fake, Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said. Fingerprints were being checked, and investigators were at the scene to collect evidence, he said. Meanwhile, a third and final Israel Air Force aircraft left Bulgaria Thursday for Israel, this one carrying coffins holding the bodies of the victims, the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement. The aircraft was to land at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv, where the coffins were to be received in an official ceremony. Thirty-three Israelis wounded in the blast arrived earlier Thursday in Tel Aviv. Maj. Gen. Itzik Kreis of the Israel Defense Forces said at the airport that one of the wounded was in critical condition. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak warned of consequences for those responsible. \u201cWe will find those who executed this attack and those who sent them,\u201d he said. At the United Nations, the Security Council issued a statement condemning the attack. In all, 32 people were hospitalized, some of them in critical condition, said Bulgaria\u2019s permanent representative to the world body, Stefan Tafrov. Two Russians, an Italian and a Slovak national were among the victims of what he called \u201cthe largest terrorist attack against Bulgaria in our modern history.\u201d Asked if Iran or Hezbollah was responsible, he said, \u201cAs of today, we don\u2019t know. We simply haven\u2019t identified the responsible country or organization or entity. We can\u2019t exclude anything, but we haven\u2019t identified the force, the organization behind this attack.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t get into the details of the investigation, which, of course, is still going on,\u201d Israel\u2019s deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, Haim Waxman, told reporters. \u201cWe know the fingerprints are very clear: The hands of Iran and Hezbollah are all over this attack.\u201d Regarded by the United States and Israel as a terrorist organization, Hezbollah is a Shiite militant group that holds power in the Lebanese government. It is financed and armed by allies Iran and Syria. Bulgaria, whose Black Sea beach resorts are a popular destination for Israelis, has not speculated on who may have been responsible for the attack. Bulgaria received nearly 8.4 million visitors in 2010, the last year for which U.N. World Tourism Organization figures are available. The vast majority of the country\u2019s visitors that year, more than 8 million, came from Europe. About 25,000 visitors came from the Middle East. Tsvetanov sought to reassure those alarmed by the attack. \u201cI can assure you that we\u2019re doing all we can to strengthen security in all the areas where it might be necessary to do so,\u201d he told Bulgarian station TV7. The Iranian Embassy statement said Iran condemns all terrorism. \u201cIran and Bulgaria are friends, and they follow their relationship on the basis of mutual respect and interests,\u201d it said. \u201cThe rotten tricks of the enemies can never shake the stability of this friendship.\u201d Iran\u2019s state-run Press TV also quoted Iranian spokesman Mehmanparast as telling the Arabic-language Al-Alam television network that Iran condemns the attack. \u201cThe Islamic Republic of Iran, which itself is the biggest victim of terrorism, considers any act that endangers the lives of innocent people in order to fulfill illegitimate political objectives as inhumane and strongly condemns it,\u201d Mehmanparast said. Bulgarian authorities believe that the bomber was carrying the bomb in a backpack, which he placed in the luggage compartment underneath the carriage, Tsvetanov said. The bus was to have taken about 47 passengers to a resort. Security footage aired by Bulgarian National TV shows the man believed to be the bomber, who is white with long hair and wearing khaki shorts, a baseball cap and sneakers. He appears relaxed as he walks among other travelers, carrying a backpack and a smaller bag. Tsvetanov had earlier said another person died overnight from the blast, but he subsequently said the Israeli ambassador had misinformed him. Read Netanyahu\u2019s full statement According to a U.S. State Department International Religious Freedom Report, released in September, more than 80% of Bulgaria\u2019s 7.6 million residents are Orthodox Christian, with Muslims making up the largest minority at about 13%. Jews make up fewer than 5% of the country\u2019s population, the report says. U.S. President Barack Obama condemned the \u201cbarbaric terrorist attack.\u201d \u201cAs Israel has tragically once more been a target of terrorism, the United States reaffirms our unshakeable commitment to Israel\u2019s security, and our deep friendship and solidarity with the Israeli people,\u201d said Obama, who called Netanyahu to express his condolences.

        "content": "A deadly explosion on a bus carrying Israeli tourists outside an airport in Bulgaria was \u201cclearly a terrorist attack,\u201d Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said Wednesday. Key Israeli politicians pointed to Iran as the likely instigator, but Israel\u2019s U.S. ambassador acknowledged they had no proof. Vania Valkova, director of the Bulgarian Interior Ministry press office, said that at least seven people were killed and about 30 wounded in the explosion in a parking lot outside Burgas Airport, on the Black Sea. The Foreign Ministry said six died and 32 people were wounded, with three in intensive care. The attack was probably initiated by a group under the auspices of \u201ceither Iran or other radical Muslim groups,\u201d according to Barak, who cited Hezbollah and Hamas as likely suspects. \u201cWe are in a continued fight against them. We are determined to identify who sent them, who executed (the attack) and to settle the account,\u201d Barak said. Bulgaria\u2019s foreign minister, Nikolay Mladenov, told CNN he presumes the explosion was a terrorist attack. But he said it was not time to \u201cstarting assigning blame.\u201d Bulgaria will ask the U.N. Security Council to condemn the attack, perhaps Thursday, said Mladenov, who traveled to the blast scene. The bus was scheduled to carry about 47 passengers to a resort. Bulgaria is a popular destination for Israelis. Another spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry said an explosive device may have been on the bus, but authorities cannot be sure. A forensic team has begun an investigation, she said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pointed to Iran, saying it has been behind a string of recent attempted attacks on Israelis in Thailand, India and Georgia, among others. \u201cAll the signs (are) leading to Iran,\u201d he said, according to a statement from his office. \u201cThis is a global Iranian terror onslaught and Israel will react firmly to it.\u201d Michael Oren, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States, said his country was investigating the circumstances. \u201cWe don\u2019t have proof of Iranian involvement but it is part of this pattern\u201d of plots around the world, he told CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d The Iranian government had no immediate comment on the incident. Read Netanyahu\u2019s full statement Bulgarian authorities also vowed to find out what happened. Israel\u2019s intelligence minister told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour that Israel has \u201cvery good indications\u201d Iran was involved. \u201cThey are after us, Israelis, wherever they can find them,\u201d said Dan Meridor.  Venelin Petkov, a reporter for bTV in Bulgaria, said that three of the wounded were in critical condition. The Bulgarian bus driver was among the dead, according to Valkova of the Bulgarian Interior Ministry. The Israelis had just arrived from Tel Aviv and were to have traveled to a beach resort about 50 kilometers (30 miles) away, he said. Security expert Ivan Boyadjiev told Bulgarian National Television that Israel had warned several months ago of the possibility of an attack on Israelis in Bulgaria.  Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev said he met the head of Mossad, Israel\u2019s intelligence service, about two months ago. \u201cIf we\u2019d received any kind of information about this, it would have been taken very seriously,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThe fact that such an attack was carried out here and now should not be interpreted as to say that Bulgaria is not a safe country for tourists.\u201d Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said he was not excluding the possibility that the explosion was a terrorist attack. \u201cI can assure you that we\u2019re doing all we can to strengthen security in all the areas where it might be necessary to do so,\u201d he said. U.S. President Barack Obama condemned what he called a \u201cbarbaric terrorist attack.\u201d \u201cAs Israel has tragically once more been a target of terrorism, the United States reaffirms our unshakeable commitment to Israel\u2019s security, and our deep friendship and solidarity with the Israeli people,\u201d said Obama, who called Netanyahu to express his condolences. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States was prepared to assist Bulgaria and Israel in bringing those responsible to justice. Neither she nor Obama mentioned Iran in their statements. The tourists\u2019 plane from Tel Aviv landed in Bulgaria at 5 p.m., the Israeli Foreign Ministry said. The flight carried 154 passengers, eight of them children. Oren Katz, who was with his wife and three children on a bus near the one that blew up, described a bloody scene. \u201cThe moment we got on (the bus), we heard a very loud explosion. It was the third bus next to us. Everyone started running in all directions. There was a big chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cWe took our children with us and ran as far as we could away from the explosion. My oldest daughter is handicapped, so I decided to run back in order to pick up her wheelchair.  \u201cThere was a big blaze of fire, and we were not allowed to come near. Suddenly, I noticed an unconscious woman laying next to me, very close to the burning bus. I picked her up together with another man, and we managed to drag her out of the fire that was about to catch her body in seconds. \u201cI cannot forget the sight of body parts scattered around the bus.\u201d The travelers were on seven buses outside the terminal; they had arrived on the same flight from Israel, Katz said. The Israeli military said it would send a medical team to Bulgaria, which Oren called a hospitable vacation destination. Bulgarian President Rossen Plevneliev: \u201cThe fact that such an attack was carried out here and now should not be interpreted as to say that Bulgaria is not a safe country for tourists,\u201d said * The explosion came on the 18th anniversary of an attack on a Jewish community center in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, in which 85 people were killed. Argentina\u2019s top prosecutor last year blamed Iran for the 1994 attack, which also wounded about 300 people. Israel also holds Iran responsible for the attack; Tehran has denied any connection to the bombing, which it has condemned. Tension between Iran and Israel has increased over the past year. Iran hanged a man who was convicted of killing one of its nuclear scientists, state-run Press TV reported in May. Majid Jamali Fashi was convicted of the January 2010 killing of Massoud Ali Mohammadi, an Iranian university professor and a nuclear scientist. He was also convicted of spying. Prosecutors accused him of working for the Mossad, and said he was paid $120,000 by Israel to carry out the hit. Israel typically does not comment on such claims. The killing was among a series of attacks against Iranian nuclear scientists in recent years. In January, Iran sent a letter to the United Nations secretary-general alleging that the killings of the scientists were terrorist attacks that followed a pattern. \u201cThere is firm evidence that certain foreign quarters are behind such assassinations,\u201d the letter said. Iran\u2019s efforts to build a nuclear program have unnerved many world leaders, resulting in condemnation and sanctions from the United Nations. Tehran insists the program is for peaceful purposes. Israel, which is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal and has expressed alarm over Tehran\u2019s hostility toward the Jewish state, has said it may attack Iran to try to stop the country from developing nuclear weapons.

        "content": "It is the breakthrough signing that has confirmed Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s arrival as a potent force in European football as they unveiled Swedish superstar Zlatan Ibrahimovic on Tuesday. The striker has been tempted away from Italian giants AC Milan to ply his trade in the French league, signing on a three-year contract for a reputed fee of $24.5 million. Ibrahimovic\u2019s capture again underlines the intentions of PSG\u2019s owners, Qatar Sports Investment, who have repeatedly stated their intention to transform the club into one of the world\u2019s biggest and best. And they have certainly put their money where their mouth is in the transfer market, signing Brazilian defender Thiago Motta as well as Argentina playmakers Ezequiel Lavezzi and Javier Pastore for enormous fees. Putting pride back into PSG: Qataris aim to be world\u2019s best But none of those who have joined the fledgling project can match the profile of Ibrahimovic, who was top scorer in Serie A last season with 28 goals. \u201cI want to thank Paris Saint-Germain and (sporting director) Leonardo for  the great work they\u2019ve done,\u201d Ibrahimovic told a press conference at the club\u2019s Parc des Princes stadium. \u201cI think they\u2019ve made something that looked impossible, possible. I\u2019m very happy to be sitting here. After lots of talks, I\u2019m finally a PSG player. It\u2019s a big step in my career, another dream come true. \u201cI think this is a very interesting project and I had no doubts. In my mind I was very clear, and I knew what I wanted. \u201cI want to be part of this club\u2019s history and I\u2019m pretty sure we will make history. I came here to win, not for anything else, and I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ll win some trophies.\u201d Ibrahimovic has played for many of Europe\u2019s top clubs in his glittering career to date. He won two Dutch titles during a three year stay at Ajax Amsterdam before moving to Juventus in Italy. He then moved to Internazionale where he helped the Nerazzurri claim three league titles before he moved to Barcelona, winning five trophies in his two seasons at the Spanish club. Ibrahimovic left after falling out with former coach Josep Guardiola and returned to Italy to play for AC Milan. There he won the Italian Cup and Serie A title. French football\u2019s $56M man: PSG poster boy Pastore His decision to leave Italy for a league many believe to be inferior could prove a watershed moment for PSG and the domestic French competition. But the Swedish star denied some press reports that he was pushed out of Milan because the club were keen to trim their wage bill.  \u201cNo-one at Milan influenced me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my choice and my choice alone. I was very happy to be at Milan. They gave me my smile back. \u201cIt\u2019s a club that will stay in my heart. They helped me and my family, and I don\u2019t want to put a shadow over my time there. They made it easy for me to come to PSG so I thank them and I wish them all the best.\u201d PSG also announced the signing of 19-year-old midfielder Marco Verratti from Serie A club Pescara and the club\u2019s sporting director Leonardo said that their transfer business had now been completed. \u201cThe market is closed for new arrivals,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Zlatan we\u2019ve finished in the transfer window this year.\u201d"

        "content": "An elderly man suspected of Nazi war crimes has been arrested in Hungary, prosecutors said Wednesday, after a worldwide Jewish rights organization discovered him living in Budapest.  Laszlo Csizsik-Csatary is accused of sending more than 15,000 Jews to the Auschwitz concentration camp in the spring of 1944, the Simon Wiesenthal Center said. The center considers him its most-wanted Nazi war criminal. The Simon Wiesenthal Center found Csizsik-Csatary as part of its Last Chance project, said Efraim Zuroff, director of the center\u2019s Israel office.  Csizsik-Csatary served as a senior Hungarian police officer in the city of Kosice, which is now in Slovakia but was under Hungarian rule in the 1940s, the center said. \u201cHe was a commander of a ghetto,\u201d Zuroff said. Csizsik-Csatary participated in the deportation of 15,700 Jews to the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1944, witnesses have told the center. He also played a role in \u201cdeportations to the Ukraine to be killed: 300 Jews,\u201d Zuroff said. \u201cWe found eyewitnesses on three different continents,\u201d Zuroff said. Those witnesses told the center about Csizsik-Csatary\u2019s cruelty to Jewish detainees and his role in the deportations to Auschwitz and Ukraine. Csizsik-Csatary denied the allegations to a reporter from the British tabloid The Sun.  A witness to the August 1941 Ukraine deportations had nine family members who were deported, Zuroff said. Csizsik-Csatary made sure four of them were brought back from forced labor with the Hungarian army so they would be deported and killed, according to Zuroff. During the Auschwitz deportations, Csizsik-Csatary \u201cforced these girls to dig a ditch with their hands \u2013 young Jewish girls.\u201d Two of the center\u2019s witnesses were survivors of that deportation, he said. Using the last name Csizsik, Csizsik-Csatary arrived in Canada in 1949, telling immigration officials he was Yugoslavian, according to The Toronto Star newspaper. Canadian authorities later investigated allegations that he had lied to immigration authorities about his past when he arrived there. Canada revoked his citizenship in 1997 and initiated an investigation.  As deportation proceedings were under way, Csizsik-Csatary voluntarily left the country. Csizsik-Csatary returned to Hungary upon leaving Canada, Zuroff said.  \u201cHungarian authorities knew that he was back,\u201d he said.  Authorities in Hungary launched an investigation in September 2011 after receiving information from Zuroff regarding Csizsik-Csatary\u2019s residence in Budapest and his role in the Auschwitz deportations, the center said.

        "content": "FIFA has employed a pair of high-profile crimefighters to help tackle corruption in the game, after a wake of scandals that have engulfed soccer\u2019s world governing body. President Sepp Blatter announced that former United States attorney Michael J Garcia and German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert had joined the organization to probe allegations of wrongdoing. Their first task will be to investigate a Swiss court document after an investigation into alleged illegal payments made by FIFA marketing partner International Sports and Leisure (ISL) to former FIFA president Joao Havelange and former executive committee member Ricardo Teixeira. The report found that Havelange had received at least 1.5 million Swiss francs ($1.53 million) and Teixeira was paid at least CHF 12.4 million ($12.64 million) from marketing partner ISL. Blatter: I knew about \u2018illegal\u2019 payments Last week Blatter admitted that he did know about the alleged bribes handed to former FIFA executives, but insisted he didn\u2019t think they were illegal at the time. As well as the new appointments, Blatter also announced a new FIFA Code of Ethics which includes provision to remove time limitations for the prosecution of bribery and corruption cases. He said the new two-chamber court would help to prosecute cases more quickly and could look retrospectively at old cases, including the process surrounding the decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively. \u201cI don\u2019t see any limitation if anything has happened,\u201d he told a press conference at FIFA\u2019s headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, when asked about the ISL case.  \u201cWe have a new set of rules and regulations, we have new regulations for the Ethics Committee, we have no statute of limitations there. \u201cWhat you are mentioning right now, this is a case that has been taken to the Supreme Court in Switzerland, where a decision was taken, so FIFA will now look into only moral and ethical issues.\u201d Garcia was appointed head of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency in the Department of Homeland Security by former president George W. Bush. He has prosecuted a number of high-profile cases including the 1993 terrorist bombing of the World Trade Center in New York. Eckert is a specialist when it comes to big bribery charges, and presided over an investigation into German telecommunications giant Siemens that uncovered billion-dollar payments. Blatter spoke of his delight at the dual appointment on his official Twitter page, writing: \u201cMajor milestone for our governance process: Ethics Code approved, independent chairmen for investigatory & adjudicatory chambers. \u201cI remain 100% committed to reforms and FIFA fully backs Michael Garcia and Hans-Joachim Eckert, the two new independent chairmen. \u201cOn my request, ISL file will be given to the new Ethics Committee. ISL is settled legally \u2013 now it will be settled also morally.\u201d Meanwhile, Mohamed bin Hammam, a former challenger to Blatter for the FIFA presidency, has been suspended for 30 days over new corruption allegations. The Qatari was banned from soccer for life after a FIFA probe found him guilty of offering bribes in return for votes during his challenge to Blatter, which he withdrew hours before his ban. He was temporarily replaced as head of the Asian Football Confederation, after serving for nine years as president. Bin Hammam has repeatedly protested his innocence and has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport with a verdict due this week. But the AFC announced on their website that he had been suspended after an inspection of the organization\u2019s accounts. The audit concerned \u201cthe negotiation and execution of certain contracts and with the financial transactions made in and out of AFC bank accounts and his personal account during the tenure of Mr Bin Hammam\u2019s presidency,\u201d it said."

        "content": "New Orleans Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma is asking a federal court for a hearing this week over the football player\u2019s yearlong suspension stemming from the \u201cbounty\u201d investigation: allegations of financial bonuses being paid to hurt opposing players. The time-sensitive request for a public hearing Thursday is opposed by the National Football League. Vilma\u2019s lawyers want a temporary restraining order preventing enforcement of the suspension before the team\u2019s training camp starts early next week. U.S. District Court Judge Helen Ginger Berrigan was expected to issue an order shortly on the hearing request. Football fans ponder bounty scandal, paralyzed player In March, the league suspended four current and former Saints players \u2013 Vilma, Scott Fujita, Anthony Hargrove and Will Smith \u2013 concluding that they had leadership roles in the pay-for-injury program. The league also suspended three coaches and the Saints\u2019 general manager this year. Vilma, a defensive captain, helped the team\u2019s defensive coordinator establish and fund the program, the league said in a news release. \u201cMultiple independent sources also confirmed that Vilma offered a specific bounty \u2013 $10,000 in cash \u2013 to any player who knocked Arizona quarterback Kurt Warner out of the 2009 Divisional Playoff Game and later pledged the same amount to anyone who knocked Minnesota quarterback Brett Favre out of the 2009 NFC Championship Game the following week,\u201d the league concluded after a monthslong internal investigation. Four players suspended in NFL bounty scandal The NFL said its investigation found that the Saints had an \u201cactive bounty program\u201d during the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons. During this time, players were purportedly offered \u201cbounty\u201d payments if they managed to hurt opposing players and knock them out of a game. Vilma then sued the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell, saying his reputation and professional career were being \u201cirreparably harmed.\u201d  The player is rehabilitating his injured knee and argued in court papers that it was necessary that his treatment be carefully supervised by team trainers and coaches. The current suspension would not allow Vilma to have contact with team personnel or be allowed on the facilities. The case is Vilma v. Goodell (2:12-cv-1283). Saints GM: Never eavesdropped on foes"

All iconic moments in the history of sport, forever etched in the memory of spectators lucky enough to be able to say \u201cI was there\u201d. But these days witnessing greatness is clearly not quite enough for the modern sports fan as countless spectators religiously record career-defining events on mobile devices and post their own personal accounts on various social media websites. Shades of greatness: Duval dreams of British Open renaissance \u201cThe pleasure of sport lies not so much in witnessing an event as talking about it,\u201d explains Ellis Cashmore, professor of Culture, Media and Sport at England\u2019s Staffordshire University. \u201cWe\u2019ve all at some point sat at home and watched a fight or a tennis match in isolation and it\u2019s never as enjoyable as when we are in company, talking about the competition as it unfolds. Mobile phones have opened out the possibilities. We can talk to anyone, anywhere while the action is taking place.\u201d One event to have resisted the tidal wave of mobile technology which has swept through society is the British Open \u2013 golf\u2019s oldest major \u2013 which will take place for the 141st time this weekend. Blog: Why U.S. golf has a healthy future But this year the R & A, which governs golf outside the United States and Mexico, has relented, allowing spectators at north-west England\u2019s Royal Lytham and St. Annes Golf Club to bring their phones into the event for the first time since 2006. \u201cThe attachment people have to their mobile phones is getting ever stronger,\u201d R & A head of communications Malcolm Booth told CNN.  \u201cPeople feel it\u2019s an item they really don\u2019t want to be separated from. It\u2019s very clear to us that people coming to any sporting event, and the Open is no exception, want to have their mobile phones with them.\u201d This is a view supported by Cashmore as he outlines how people are increasingly unwilling to venture out of the house without a mobile phone in their pocket. \u201cMobiles are now less accessories, more extensions of our lives,\u201d said Cashmore, who is currently conducting a study entitled \u201cBarbaric Britain?\u201d  \u201cWe can manage without our watches or our keys, but not our phones. They are like pacemakers \u2013 artificial devices, but vital for the regulation of organs. \u201cMore generally we are consuming sports differently today than we were as recently as five years ago. The pattern is towards a much more remote consumption through smartphones and mobile computers.  \u201cPortability is the key to this. We consume not just sport but everything on the move.\u201d Current world No. 3 Lee Westwood, searching for a first major title in front of his home fans, sees no reason why the public should be separated from their trusty mobile phones, providing the players are not distracted at crucial moments. Australian Adam Scott, also looking for a first win in one of golf\u2019s four marquee events, agrees with Westwood, though as long as the sport\u2019s fans observe the customary on-course etiquette. The R & A have set up designated \u201cMobile Device Zones\u201d where visitors can use their phones, while also attempting to ensure spectators do not take home their every own visual souvenirs. \u201cThere are obviously great challenges with that,\u201d outlined Booth. \u201cThat provision is in keeping with many sporting events, including the Olympics where they are going to have exactly the same challenge.  \u201cWe have a very strict mobile phone policy at the Open Championship this year which means there are dedicated areas where people can use their phones.  \u201cThe hope is they will not use phones to any great extent near play and we\u2019ll have a marshal near play encouraging that behavior. It is one of the great challenges of allowing mobile phones at any sporting event.\u201d Cashmore argues such personal recordings of events are used by people to enhance their eye-witness memories. \u201cWe remember experiences by context:  the circumstances that form the setting for an event, what happened immediately before and afterwards, and the people with whom we stood, sat and chatted to,\u201d said Cashmore.  \u201cPhones enable us to extend this to a wider network of people. By describing an experience we memorialize it.\u201d One man who believes sport\u2019s iconic moments do not require additional \u201cmemorializing\u201d is British journalist Richard Williams, the author of Perfect 10: Football\u2019s dreamer, schemers playmakers and playboys. Ten years ago Williams was at Hampden Park, Glasgow when Zidane\u2019s audacious left-foot strike in the last minute of the first half proved enough to give Real Madrid a 2-1 win over Germany\u2019s Bayer Leverkusen in one of soccer\u2019s most high-profile matches \u2013 the European Champions League final. Williams believes he witnessed a sporting moment of such complete perfection he decided to never watch a replay of the now iconic goal. \u201cMaybe people growing up now, in the age of technology and media saturation, will develop a different attitude,\u201d wrote Williams in a chapter extolling the talents of Zidane. \u201cBut one of the pleasures of being a football fan is the archive of individual images saved on the memory\u2019s hard drive. \u201cEach of them is divorced from its immediate context: only with the greatest difficulty could I dredge up the details of the matches in question, never mind its result. \u201cI wanted Zidane\u2019s goal to claim a place in that personal file \u2026 If I watched it again on television, I would inevitably be replacing my own image of the moment with that of a television camera, if only partially. \u201cIt would not contain within it the surge of exhilaration and admiration that I felt in that moment and that remain part of the emotional response to replaying the goal as it was experienced from my own point of view.\u201d Despite the compelling and heartfelt argument put forward by Williams, Booth is confident the British Open will retain the aura which has helped it become one of golf\u2019s most cherished tournaments. \u201cYou can\u2019t swim against the tide in terms of technology and we\u2019re not the only sporting event having to deal with this challenge,\u201d said Booth. \u201cWe\u2019ve got great television partners and they are always going to find a way to romanticize those phenomenal sporting moments. Equally, people will want to take their own records of sporting events. \u201cThere would be no point trying to fight that, it is the way people want to consume events now. But traditional media will always allow you to present events in the way they should be.\u201d So with the influence of the phone continuing to grow, how long before spectators are so busy tweeting about the British Open they miss the champion lifting the Claret Jug?

        "content": "As the British Open reached its climax 12 months ago, a weather beaten Rory McIlroy cut a frustrated figure, as he aimed a few barbs at the tournament many consider to be golf\u2019s greatest. Coming into the championship off the back of his maiden major victory, at the U.S. Open, McIlroy finished tied for 25th and struggled to adapt to the changeable conditions on Kent\u2019s south coast. The 23-year-old bemoaned the extent to which he thought the weather affected the outcome and was adamant  there was \u201cno point in changing your game for one week a year.\u201d But a year on as he prepares to launch his latest challenge to win the famous Claret Jug, McIlroy has put those comments down to frustration and says this year\u2019s build up has been happily free of the vortex of media attention that swirled as fiercely as the wind at Royal St. George\u2019s. \u201cLast year it was complete mayhem so this week it has been lovely just to be able to go about my business and prepare the way I wanted to,\u201d he told the Open Championship\u2019s official website. \u201cI have tried to keep it as low key as possible. I wanted to go about my business as quietly as possible and I felt that I have done that pretty well.\u201d And what of those digs aimed at the tournament immediately after his closing round 74? \u201cThose comments were just pure frustration,\u201d he explained. \u201cI had really high expectations coming off a major win. I really wanted to play well but (I didn\u2019t and) I ended up blaming the weather, blaming the draw, blaming my luck, basically.  \u201cLooking back on it a year later, I just didn\u2019t play well enough to get into contention and didn\u2019t handle the conditions as best as I could have.\u201d The Northern Irishman struggled during the defense of his U.S. Open crown at the Olympic Club in San Francisco back in June, but said he was satisfied with his form coming into the third major of the year. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m hitting the ball great. I think it\u2019s the best I have swung the club all year. It\u2019s going to be all about keeping the ball in play, keeping it out of the bunkers and, if I can do that, I think I have a great chance. \u201cI\u2019m going to knuckle down, focus and keep fighting. I will stay tough and try to shoot a low score even if the conditions are bad.\u201d McIlroy is one of the favorites for the tournament, as is four-time major winner Phil Mickelson.  The American, known as \u201cLefty\u201d, tied for second behind last year\u2019s winner, Darren Clarke, and he told a press conference an ability to play well in poor weather has provided a boost for his confidence. \u201cI think what was so fun for me about last year was that I was able to make a move in horrible weather, and that\u2019s one of the things that has excited me because historically I\u2019ve not played well in bad weather,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I look at it a little bit differently.  And I almost welcome it, in a sense. But I certainly have more confidence in competing and playing in weather and the different challenges that links golf presents after having had some success after last year.\u201d English hopes rest mostly on Luke Donald and Lee Westwood, who sandwich McIlroy in the world rankings.  Both are still searching for their first major success and will be heartened to know the last 15 have been won by 15 different players. World No. 1 Donald struggled at the U.S Open, missing the cut, but says he is confident his game can stand up to the rigors of Lytham having played well at last week\u2019s Scottish Open. \u201cI feel like I did a lot of good work in the last two weeks. And I felt quite comfortable in the competition last week at the Scottish Open. I hit a lot of very solid tee shots, and that\u2019s exactly what you need to do around here.  \u201cI do like this course. I think it\u2019s set up great. It\u2019s very fair, but it\u2019s very tough. It\u2019s certainly, I think, going to produce the guy who plays the best because there\u2019s no escaping some holes; you\u2019ve just got to step up there and hit good tee shots.\u201d Westwood, the current world No. 3, is hoping he can become the first English winner of an Open on English soil since Tony Jacklin in 1969. \u201cI\u2019m just going to shake the cards and see where they fall,\u201d he told a press conference. \u201cThis is the biggest championship in the world for me.  \u201cI\u2019d love to become the first Englishman to win on English soil since Tony (Jacklin) but that\u2019s not going to put any extra pressure on me. I\u2019m fairly relaxed. I\u2019m always pretty relaxed nowadays. There\u2019s not a lot that winds me up.\u201d "

        "content": "Hans Kristian Rausing, an heir to a packaging company fortune, was charged Tuesday \u201cwith preventing the lawful and decent burial\u201d of his wife, Eva, London police said. Her body was found last week when police searched the couple\u2019s home, in an expensive London neighborhood, after he was stopped on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and arrested on drug charges. Hans Kristian Rausing, 49, is the son of Hans Rausing, who is worth an estimated $10 billion, thanks to the family\u2019s connection to Swedish packaging giant Tetra Laval. He is to appear Wednesday at West London Magistrates\u2019 Court.  The death of his 48-year-old wife remains unexplained pending further tests, police said Friday, but the heiress\u2019s previous problems with drugs are well documented. Her father, Tom Kemeny, paid tribute Tuesday to his \u201cbeloved daughter.\u201d He described her as an \u201cAmerican philanthropist, loving wife and mother, who helped countless addicts, and children.\u201d The tribute was e-mailed to reporters by a public relations firm representing the family. Read the full tribute He also expressed the family\u2019s love and support for her husband, who was arrested on suspicion of murder after her body was found. Recounting her early life, starting with her birth in Hong Kong in 1963, Kemeny painted a picture of a bright and loving, but shy, girl. \u201cWe think she started experimenting with drugs in her late teens to overcome her shyness,\u201d he wrote, adding that this drug use affected her studies in California. His daughter eventually recovered in the 1980s and dedicated many of her efforts to helping other addicts, he said, before marrying Rausing, the son of one of the world\u2019s wealthiest men, with whom she had four children. The couple continued to support her \u201clife-long vocation in helping those with drug addiction,\u201d Kemeny said, helping to \u201csave\u201d the lives of many other people \u2013 though \u201ctragically, not her own.\u201d He also paid tribute to her sharp wit and intelligence, devotion to her children and care for others. A Kemeny family statement released with his tribute said: \u201cWe believe her tragic death highlights the scourge of drugs and that it does not matter how rich, intelligent or beautiful you are, you can still be impacted and overcome by this terrible disease.\u201d Kemeny said the best way to remember his daughter would be to carry on her efforts to help those battling addiction, especially women. \u201cEva would have wanted the memory of her life to be used to benefit others facing similar addiction challenges in their lives,\u201d his tribute said. \u201cThe Kemeny family hopes this tribute will be used to draw attention to the tragedy of drug addiction and to generate awareness and financial support for this cause in the future.\u201d The Kemeny family intends to set up a foundation in her memory in due time, it said. The family statement also appeals for donations in Eva Rausing\u2019s name to a drug awareness and treatment fund, or to the UK charity Action on Addiction, which she supported. It quotes Nick Barton, chief executive of Action on Addiction, as saying: \u201cEva worked tirelessly for years, without any desire for public recognition and despite her own health issues, to help people and charities in the addiction field through her wonderfully generous support.\u201d \u201cEva and Hans Kristian were a devoted and loving couple for the 21 years they spent together. They benefited thousands of lives through their personal involvement and philanthropic activities,\u201d Kemeny wrote. \u201cThey bravely battled their demons and supported each other and Eva will be a devastating loss to our beloved \u2018son\u2019 Hans Kristian, whom we love unconditionally with all our hearts.\u201d Swedish billionaire\u2019s son Rausing arrested after wife, Eva, found dead UK police: Billionaire\u2019s son Rausing arrested on suspicion of murder"

        "content": "Aquatic \u201cdead zones\u201d are a tragic illustration of human beings\u2019 negative impact on the world\u2019s oceans. They are areas so overloaded with pollutants that they have difficulty sustaining any life. The flow of fertilizers, sewage and industrial pollutants into rivers and seas has overloaded some coastal marine areas with nutrient waste such as nitrogen and phosphorus. This stimulates excessive growth of plants and algae, which use up oxygen dissolved in the water and kill off other marine life that depend on it. Globally, their numbers are increasing, with more than 530 aquatic dead zones around the world, encompassing more than 95,000 square miles, according to the World Resources Institute (WRI). Some scientists believe climate change may also be making the situation worse.  But help may be at hand thanks to the development of a number of technological solutions that aim to bring the dead zones back to life. Scientists in Sweden are testing an idea to pump oxygen into the Baltic Sea \u2013 which separates Scandinavia from mainland Europe and is the world\u2019s largest man-made dead zone \u2013 in an attempt to revive its dying ecosystem. The Baltic region has suffered badly over the past 60 years from a rising flow of human and industrial waste. What\u2019s more, because the Baltic Sea is largely enclosed, such harmful pollutants take longer to be washed out than in open waters. \u201cAs with all marine issues you do not see what is down there and sea bottoms are mostly neglected because in general people think there is no life,\u201d said Inger Naslund, from environmental group WWF Sweden. \u201cThe effects of human behavior is many times reflected at the sea bottom and should be discussed with a louder voice.\u201d Attempts to reduce the waste being dumped into the Baltic have so far failed to stop the growth of the dead zone, now equivalent to around one and half times the size of Denmark. The lack of progress has led a number of Baltic countries to consider technological interventions, or so-called \u201cgeoengineering\u201d ideas (large-scale solutions to environmental problems), such as pumping oxygen into the water, and using chemicals to bind pollutants in sediments, in a bid to save the Baltic. The Swedish government is funding research into the feasibility of using a wind-turbine driven oxygen pump in the Baltic, following studies carried out last year by the University of Gothenburg, which looked at the effect of pumping oxygen-rich surface water to the bottom of two Swedish fjords.  \u201cToday everyone is focused on reducing nutrient inputs to the sea in order to reduce eutrophication (the effect of excessive nutrients) in the Baltic, but by helping nature itself to deal with the phosphorus that is discharged we can create a turbo effect in the battle against eutrophication,\u201d said Anders Stigebrandt, of the University of Gothenburg\u2019s Department of Earth Sciences.   See also: Floating turbine buoys offshore wind potential If implemented, the Baltic Deepwater Oxygenation (Box) project would require around 100 pumping stations built around the Baltic Sea to transport oxygen deep underwater to counteract the declining amounts of oxygen and prevent the growth of the dead zone.  However, not everyone is convinced by the geoengineering ideas. Professor Daniel Conley from Lund University in Sweden, says they are \u201cdangerous quick-fixes,\u201d which could have a number of \u201cunforeseen\u201d consequences and allow countries to ignore their obligations for reducing the waste they dump in the Baltic. \u201cIt could completely change the ecology of the Sea,\u201d he said, adding that the oxygen-pumping plan could interfere with the reproductive successes of some fish species and cause the release of old contaminants buried underground. Conversely, it could also raise water temperatures and stimulate higher algae growth. Scientists in Sweden are also testing the use of a chloride, used in treating drinking water, to try to bind phosphorus pollutants in sediments. But writing in science journal Nature, Conley was also skeptical of the idea of using chemicals to bind pollutants.  Conley says it is not yet known how long the pollutants can remain buried within sediments or whether it would even be legal to add large quantities of chemicals to the Baltic Sea. Environmental groups within the Baltic region support the research into geoengineering projects but are doubtful it can be scaled up.  \u201cMaybe these geoengineering ideas can work in a small inlet or lake but it would cost far too much to be a solution for the whole of the Baltic Sea,\u201d said Naslund. See also: Australia to create marine parks Baltic environmental group the Estonian Fund for Nature (ELF) says it does not rule out supporting geoengineering ideas like the oxygen-pumping plan but would wait to see a proper ecosystem report of any potential risks. Conley says any geoengineering idea was likely to cost millions, and in the case of oxygen-pumping, would have to continue for several decades.  Such a large amount of time and money, he believes, would be better directed at reducing land-based sources of nutrients rather than at expensive and potentially harmful schemes to engineer a solution. \u201cThe Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP), signed by all the nations surrounding the Baltic, sets targets for reducing nutrient waste levels. Sweden is now saying it wants to use geoengineering to help meet its targets. It\u2019s a politically quick solution to a very difficult problem,\u201d said Conley.  \u201cThese (oxygen pumping) plans are not solving the problem unless you reduce the nutrient waste being dumped in the Sea in the first place.\u201d"

But at the bottom of the football pyramid \u2013 a world that receives little attention from the global media \u2013 there are many deals that involve young players who are just starting their careers, the clubs that have trained them, and those that are interested in signing them in the hope that they might be the next Lionel Messi. The story of Messi\u2019s early years in Argentina and his signing by Barcelona has been retold countless times. Of how, diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency, the kid who would become the world\u2019s best player went to Spain after Barcelona offered to pay his medical bills. What is less well known is that Barcelona did not immediately pay his former club Newell\u2019s Old Boys the training compensation fee that the Argentine team was due. Can PSG\u2019s big bucks buy world domination? Newell\u2019s Old Boys did claim $42,867 in reparation, but had to go all the way to FIFA\u2019s Dispute Resolution Chamber to get the payment. It takes time and money for clubs to develop players, but the rewards can be enormous given the voracious appetite of ambitious teams looking for new talent. But this talent trawl leaves casualties and an academic study in 2009 estimated as many as 20,000 African boys are living in the streets of Europe after failing to secure contracts with European clubs following their trials. Under rules established by football\u2019s international governing body FIFA, those clubs seeking that new talent agree to pay the team that nurtured the youngster a \u201ctraining compensation\u201d fee. FIFA has a cash formula that is designed to compensate the \u201ctraining club\u201d for the years spent developing players up to the age of 23, when they sign their first professional contract. However, sports agent Paulo Teixeira says some European teams do not always play ball in agreeing these compensation fees.  Teixeira, who has worked as a player agent and once represented former Brazil international Roberto Carlos, has taken to posting about training compensation on Facebook., pointing to the way social media was used during the Arab Spring as a motivation in raising publicity over the issue. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of culture,\u201d Teixeira writes on Facebook, recounting what he says he was told by an executive of a European team ahead of the Champions League final in Munich back in May.  \u201cEuropean clubs are ready to pay millions on transfer fees, but when it comes to settling training compensation to African or South Americans clubs, it becomes a problem. \u201cClubs know that they will have to pay once the cases reach FIFA, but until then they buy time.\u201d The Brazilian agent is football\u2019s equivalent of a bounty hunter, taking a hefty commission from the teams he represents in cases he takes before FIFA to claim training compensation from larger clubs. Teixeira details his disputes with a number of those European clubs on Facebook, claiming they failed to pay the true cost of training a player to the development club, based on FIFA\u2019s formula. Unhappy about these Facebook postings, at least two of those clubs \u2013 Italy\u2019s AC Milan and Anderlecht of Belgium \u2013 have complained to FIFA about what they claim is \u201cdefamation and calumny\u201d. \u201cFIFA can confirm that AC Milan and Anderlecht have lodged complaints against the agent Paulo Teixeira and that FIFA has opened a case,\u201d FIFA told CNN. \u201cHowever, as the investigations are currently ongoing we cannot comment or speculate at this stage.\u201d But as well referencing the Arab Spring, Teixeira quotes the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \u2013  \u201ceveryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression\u201d \u2013 as justification for his campaign. In one of the cases Teixeira posts about, he claims AC Milan owes Botafogo FC of Ribeirao Preto compensation involving its training of the player Sergio Ceregatti. He says the claim is based on the calculation that Ceregatti was with the Brazilian club for four years before moving to Italy. Ceregatti initially joined Ancona and then signed for Milan, with Botafogo not compensated for those formative years of training as per FIFA\u2019s rules. \u201cAt this stage, I just can tell you that the player gave three different declarations (one of them signed by his father, when Ceregatti was still a minor) about the duration of his registration to Botafogo \u2013 nine months; 24 months; 48 months circa,\u201d said Leandro Cantamessa, the lawyer acting for AC Milan.  \u201cAC Milan immediately paid on May 2011 the amount requested by Teixeira pursuant to the first player\u2019s declaration and moreover in conformity with Botafogo\u2019s records, as collected by Brazilian Federation (CBF) in the so-called sport passport, duly attached to the first Teixeira claim.  \u201cThe last declaration has been released by Ceregatti in Brazil, in January 2012, after his escape from Italy and from contractual obligations with AC Milan.\u201d  Texeira tells a very different story, insisting he has full the support of Ceregatti, who recently returned to Brazil after signing with Vasco da Gama, and that the Brazilian footballer confirms he had been at Botafogo for four years since the age of 12 from 2004. The gambling game: Soccer\u2019s battle with betting \u201cThe claim is for Botafogo and has nothing to do with Ceregatti,\u201d added Teixeira, after CNN asked to interview the player.   As for Anderlecht, general manager Hermann van Holsbeeck refused to comment on Teixeira\u2019s $122,822 compensation claim on behalf of DR Congo club CS Aigles Verts relating to one of their players, but added: \u201cWe have introduced a file against Teixeira by FIFA. We will defend our position at the court.\u201d  Teixeira works closely with the Brazilian National Amateur League manager Jose Tobaldini, who keeps track of 140,000 players on a computer database and believes hundreds of young players literally \u201cdisappear\u201d from their clubs \u2013 lured away by agents and scouts. \u201cI know they\u2019ve all gone to Europe, most of them have the possibility of acquiring dual citizenship,\u201d says Tobaldini. Teixeira claims on Facebook that \u201ca generation of dozens of young Brazilian and African players were literally taken away from their original clubs by dubious agents and brought to Italy under the so-called primo tesseramento (first contract).\u201d Often smaller clubs in Brazil and Africa do not have the financial resources to find out what has happened to their players after they have left, presumably for Europe \u2013 which means they are often left without compensation.  That is where Teixeira steps in.  After a player has turned professional, Teixeira \u2013 with the help of Tobaldini \u2013 tracks down the development club to see if there are compensation issues and then begins the administrative process of demanding what he says is the correct sum to be paid by the European clubs. \u201cIn the beginning I was approaching the clubs, but now more and more I am approached by clubs,\u201d said Teixeira. \u201cAll due to the internet, as you can imagine. Some African agents have sent me messages saying I\u2019ve become an icon.\u201d In an arrangement that is reminiscent of the kind of fees \u201cuplift\u201d that successful personal injury lawyers use to get paid if and when a dispute is resolved, Teixeria would receive a 20% commission of the amount of the claim. So in the cases he lists on Facebook, the potential compensation amount is close to $2.4 million, which would net Teixeira approximately $480,000 if he is successful.  \u201cBig clubs are always challenging the conformity of training compensation with EU law,\u201d said Argentine lawyer Ariel Reck, who also has experience with of this area and it is a view supported by British lawyer Guy Thomas. \u201cThe Jean-Marc Bosman case may have increased player power,\u201d said Thomas, referring to the landmark judgment allowing players to move for free at the end of their contract, \u201cbut ongoing uncertainty over the best way to calculate compensation still allows clubs the chance to push back or delay payment.\u201d Blog: Time to get tough on racism in football Reck admits these cases are a gravy train for agents and lawyers. \u201cThis is also a business for sports lawyers, I have to confess. Not only South American but also big European firms (mostly Spanish due to language issues) offer clubs the services to claim and collect such compensations. Fees can be as high as 30% of the amount,\u201d he said. Gravy train or not, this issue may also be an administrative headache for FIFA, which says it receives 3,500 complaints a year \u2013 though not all of these relate to training compensation cases.  \u201cFIFA\u2019s normal procedure says that a case should be opened within three to five weeks after the claim is lodged,\u201d said lawyer Fernando Lamar, who works with Teixeira.  \u201cFIFA says that an ordinary case would take six to 12 months to be solved. However, we have cases in progress for almost two years and we\u2019re not halfway through.  \u201cYou cannot imagine the time and energy spent trying to reach a FIFA officer to have information about the claims. It is almost a lost battle; the most common responses we get are, \u2018We are overloaded,\u2019 \u2018We have no time.\u2019 \u201c In a statement to CNN, FIFA said: \u201cCases are normally opened within a couple of weeks following the receipt of the relevant complaint.  \u201cAs to the duration of a specific procedure, we need to emphasize that many factors influence the advancement of the investigation phase and the decision-making process: the cooperation of the parties, the complexity of the matter, the extent of the documentation provided, the availability of the deciding body \u2013 just to name a few.  \u201cConsequently, we are really not in a position to comment on an estimated timescale .\u201d In a recent edition of the Sports Law Bulletin, a doctoral researcher at England\u2019s University of Westminster came up with an idea to help protect the treatment of minors in football. \u201cA possible solution to prevent such circumstances could be introduction of a form of authorization for trials via the transfer matching system, albeit trials cannot be deemed as a transfer, \u201d wrote Serhat Yilmaz, referring to FIFA\u2019s governing body electronic method of conducting transfers. So as the lawyers, agents and administrators argue, does Tobaldini have any advice for parents considering letting their offspring move to European clubs? \u201cFirst you should build the athlete up, maintain his focus on school and look for an agent \u2013 properly accredited \u2013 with the goal of taking care of his professional career.\u201d"

        "content": "The Russian Football Union (RFU) has appointed Fabio Capello as the new national team manager. The former England coach will be hoping to revive the fortunes of a promising Russian squad after a disappointing Euro 2012, where they crashed out at the group stages.  \u201cToday we decided to appoint Capello as our national team\u2019s new manager,\u201d  RFU deputy president Nikita Simonyan told ITAR-TASS news agency. Simonyan, the acting chief of the Union, said they expected the Italian \u201cto come to Moscow in the nearest future to finalize the details of his contract and sign it.\u201d Capello is expected in the Russian capital on Wednesday or Thursday.  The 66-year-old has previously coached the English national side to quarterfinals at the 2010 World Cup and 2008 European Championships. He quit in February after the English FA stripped John Terry of the national side\u2019s captaincy without his consultation.  Before moving into international football Capello won domestic and continental titles with AC Milan, Juventus, Roma and Spanish side Real Madrid.  Capello had been part of a managerial wish list published by the RFU featuring, amongst others, former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, former Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez and World Cup winning Italian manager Marcello Lippi.  Capello told the Italian news agency ANSA that he was \u201chappy and proud\u201d to be taking charge of the Russian national team.  \u201cI\u2019ll be happy if my work with the Russian team will go the right way. The cooperation with this team is a great challenge for me as Russia is a great country.\u201d World Soccer Magazine\u2019s executive editor Keir Radnedge told CNN the Russian national team \u201cwanted international pedigree, they felt this was important.\u201d \u201cThey want pedigree, achievement, which whatever he did or didn\u2019t do with England he certainly did at club level,\u201d he said. \u201cThey felt he qualified England for two major tournaments and he got them through the group stages. He\u2019s now got the international tournament pedigree he didn\u2019t have before he got the England job.\u201d Capello replaces the Dutch coach Dick Advocaat, whose Russian team crashed out of Euro 2012 after a surprise defeat by Greece in the group stages. Russia is hosting the 2018 FIFA World Cup and Radnedge believes this had a bearing on Capello\u2019s appointment.  \u201cThere has been talk that if he gets them through the next two years then he could go on to the hosting in Russia. It is important for the Russians to build their own kudos on the world stage. They\u2019ve gone to so many tournaments and started like world beaters and really fizzled out halfway along the course.\u201d Capello\u2019s first game in charge will be against Northern Ireland on September 7 when Russia begin their campaign to qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

        "content": "Hans Kristian Rausing, the son of one of the world\u2019s richest men, appeared in court Wednesday charged with \u201cpreventing the lawful and decent burial\u201d of his wife, Eva, UK media said. Her body was discovered in an advanced state of decomposition on the floor by a bed in an annex of the couple\u2019s central London mansion, the Press Assocation news agency said. Rausing looked frail as he appeared in the courtroom, the news agency said. His appearance came a day after he was charged by London police with preventing his wife\u2019s lawful and decent burial. Eva Rausing\u2019s body was found last week when police searched the couple\u2019s home after her husband was stopped on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and then arrested on drug charges.  Hans Kristian Rausing, 49, is the son of Hans Rausing, who is worth an estimated $10 billion, thanks to the family\u2019s connection to Swedish packaging giant Tetra Laval. A statement released on behalf of his parents by a public relations firm representing the family said they wanted privacy to grieve. \u201cHans and Marit Rausing and their families are mourning the death of their son\u2019s beloved wife, Eva. Her death, and the details of subsequent events, are a reminder of the distorted reality of drug addiction,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThey desperately hope that their dear son, Hans, may find the strength to begin the long and hard journey of detoxification and rehabilitation.\u201d Hans Kristian Rausing was initially arrested on suspicion of murder after the discovery of his wife\u2019s body but has not been charged with that crime. The death of his 48-year-old wife remains unexplained pending further tests, police said Friday, but the heiress\u2019s previous problems with drugs are well documented. Her father, Tom Kemeny, paid tribute Tuesday to his \u201cbeloved daughter.\u201d He described her as an \u201cAmerican philanthropist, loving wife and mother, who helped countless addicts, and children.\u201d The tribute was e-mailed to reporters by a public relations firm representing the family. Read the full tribute He also expressed the family\u2019s love and support for her husband. Recounting her early life, starting with her birth in Hong Kong in 1963, Kemeny painted a picture of a bright and loving, but shy, girl. \u201cWe think she started experimenting with drugs in her late teens to overcome her shyness,\u201d he wrote, adding that this drug use affected her studies in California. His daughter eventually recovered in the 1980s and dedicated many of her efforts to helping other addicts, he said, before marrying Rausing, with whom she had four children. Swedish billionaire\u2019s son Rausing arrested after wife, Eva, found dead The couple continued to support her \u201clife-long vocation in helping those with drug addiction,\u201d Kemeny said, helping to \u201csave\u201d the lives of many other people \u2013 though \u201ctragically, not her own.\u201d He also paid tribute to her sharp wit and intelligence, devotion to her children and care for others. A Kemeny family statement released with his tribute said: \u201cWe believe her tragic death highlights the scourge of drugs and that it does not matter how rich, intelligent or beautiful you are, you can still be impacted and overcome by this terrible disease.\u201d Kemeny said the best way to remember his daughter would be to carry on her efforts to help those battling addiction, especially women. \u201cEva would have wanted the memory of her life to be used to benefit others facing similar addiction challenges in their lives,\u201d his tribute said. \u201cThe Kemeny family hopes this tribute will be used to draw attention to the tragedy of drug addiction and to generate awareness and financial support for this cause in the future.\u201d UK police: Billionaire\u2019s son Rausing arrested on suspicion of murder The Kemeny family intends to set up a foundation in her memory in due time, it said. The family statement also appeals for donations in Eva Rausing\u2019s name to a drug awareness and treatment fund, or to the UK charity Action on Addiction, which she supported. It quotes Nick Barton, chief executive of Action on Addiction, as saying: \u201cEva worked tirelessly for years, without any desire for public recognition and despite her own health issues, to help people and charities in the addiction field through her wonderfully generous support.\u201d \u201cEva and Hans Kristian were a devoted and loving couple for the 21 years they spent together. They benefited thousands of lives through their personal involvement and philanthropic activities,\u201d Kemeny wrote. \u201cThey bravely battled their demons and supported each other and Eva will be a devastating loss to our beloved \u2018son\u2019 Hans Kristian, whom we love unconditionally with all our hearts.\u201d"

        "content": "The Kemeny family is deeply distressed by the tragedy of their daughter, Eva\u2019s, death and have seen the widespread worldwide media coverage of her difficulties over the last few days. Eva would have wanted the memory of her life to be used to benefit others facing similar addiction challenges in their lives. The Kemeny family hopes this tribute will be used to draw attention to the tragedy of drug addiction and to generate awareness and financial support for this cause in the future. In due course they will launch a foundation. American philanthropist, loving wife and mother, who helped countless addicts, and children   By Tom Kemeny, Eva\u2019s father Eva Louise Kemeny was born on 7 March, 1964 exactly nine months and one week after Nancy and I were married in Goldsboro, North Carolina on 1 June, 1963.     Eva was born in the Matilda War Memorial Hospital on the Peak of Hong Kong. Our darling Eva was literally delivered by me and a 16 year old assistant nurse, since the doctor had failed to show-up. When Eva was born, I wrapped her up in a towel, still attached to Nancy\u2019s umbilical cord, and held her up to show Nancy our beautiful first born. Nancy said, \u201cOh, a boy!\u201d And I said, \u201cNot exactly, what you\u2019re seeing is the umbilical cord.\u201d Thus Eva entered dramatically into our world.     From Hong Kong we moved to Sydney and from there to Milan where her sister, Be, was born. We then moved to Rome in 1967, where Eva attended the original Montessori Nursery.   In 1970 we moved to London and Eva first attended Garden House School, and then later Queens Gate, followed by the American School in London. She was an immensely bright, loving but very shy little girl.   We think she started experimenting with drugs in her late teens to overcome her shyness. The drug dependency impacted poor Eva, and her attendance, at Occidental College in Los Angeles.    After attending many drug rehabilitation centres in the USA and the UK, Eva finally recovered in the late 1980\u2019s. Her recovery was strong and, as is customary in the 12-Step Programme, she went around London and the UK sharing her life and experiences to explain that recovery is possible and to give hope and support to others. This became a major defining endeavour in her short life: to help others, especially those with drug addictions.    Before her marriage, Eva worked for two years in John Aspinal\u2019s London office, as his assistant, where her duties included buying exotic fruit for his large collection of gorillas. She married Hans Kristian Rausing on 16 October, 1992 at the Swedish Church in London. The service was officiated by the Archbishop of Sweden, assisted by Reverend Lennart Sjostrom, the former Rector of the Swedish Church in London. Recently he commented: \u201cI just saw two people who were immensely happy and so in love, and I remember the looks on their faces as they exchanged their vows and promised to love and honour each other.\u201d Reverend Sjostrom also baptised their four children.    After her marriage, they attended Richmond College, where Eva read Economics and Hans Kristian read English literature. She also attended the London School of Economics for a short time.   Eva played a pivotal part in her life-long vocation in helping those with drug addiction. She joined the Board of both Clouds and Chemical Dependency Centre in the early 2000s, which later formally became Action on Addiction in 2007 after merging with a third charity. It is a national organisation that provides direct and indirect help to both addicts and their families. The indirect help it provides includes training for professionals, counselling, research and campaigning support. Its direct help includes residential and out-patient treatment to those suffering from addiction, in addition to offering support to their families.    Eva\u2019s particular interest within Action on Addiction was Hope House, a specialist unit for women to deal with complex issues - not just drug addiction, but eating disorders, mental illness and domestic abuse. Eva and Hans Kristian were adamant that no one should be turned away from treatment for addiction. They passionately (and anonymously) supported \u2018Charity Funded Treatment\u2019 for those that could not get statutory funding or raise the funds themselves.    From early 2000 up until her death, Eva was involved with RAPT, Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners\u2019 Trust. Although Eva was not on the Board or a trustee and had no official capacity, she was a life-time supporter and dedicated her time to visit women\u2019s prisons, such as Send.    Tristan Millington-Drake, who worked with Eva on her charitable activities, remembers the caring attitude she took to her work: \u201cShe was never afraid to visit women addicts in prison and in connecting with them she was always open about her own struggles in the hope that she might help them.\u201d Tristan remembers her love of cats which even extended into her support for the Animals at War memorial in London\u2019s Park Lane: \u201cShe was always mischievously trying to get them to include cats in the memorial, despite it being pointed out to her that cats didn\u2019t go to war.\u201d      Eva was also a patron of the Mentor Foundation, a charity purely concerned with drug prevention which was founded in the early 2000s.    Ten years ago Hans Kristian and Eva established Verdun in Barbados, a full 12-Step Recovery clinic which remains unique in the Caribbean. Verdun has treated over 2,000 local Bajan people since its foundation.  Eva and Hans Kristian have essentially been the only benefactors of this facility. There are plans to develop a women\u2019s unit, as it had become a male-only facility.  The charity also set up a Halfway House which provides training and rehabilitation to reintegrate recovering addicts into society.    Through her endeavours, both with her personal involvement and charitable contribution, Eva and Hans Kristian \u201csaved\u201d thousands of lives - tragically not her own. This is a stark reminder that the illness of addiction knows no social class or gender.   As Nick Barton, Chief Executive of Action on Addiction, said recently: \u201cEva worked tirelessly for years, without any desire for public recognition and despite her own health issues, to help people and charities in the addiction field through her wonderfully generous support.\u201d   \u201cEva was much admired for the very personal commitment shared with her husband Hans Kristian in supporting a number of charitable causes, including several organisations in the addiction field.\u201d   Eva and her husband were also generous patrons of many other good causes. She had a sharp and intelligent wit, and her sparkling eyes often betrayed what she was about to say. Her beautifully written messages and emails were in equal turns both provocative and humorous, but always a pleasure to read. The love she had for her children was the most dominant theme in her life, and one which occupied her every day. Even in the depths of her despair she always worried more about the happiness and well-being of others. At the time of her death her over-riding concern was for the safety of her beloved husband, for whom she interrupted her own treatment to return to London in an attempt to take him back with her to California, but tragically to no avail.   We shall always remember Eva as a beautiful, generous, and fun daughter, wife, mother, sister and aunt. Eva and Hans Kristian adored each other and their four beautiful children. When not in London they would have family holidays with their cousins and extended family, without any glitz or glamour.    Eva and Hans Kristian were a devoted and loving couple for the 21 years they spent together. They benefited thousands of lives through their personal involvement and philanthropic activities. They bravely battled their demons and supported each other and Eva will be a devastating loss to our beloved \u201cson\u201d Hans Kristian, whom we love unconditionally with all our hearts.  \u201cA loved one is a treasure of the heart and to lose a loved one is like losing a piece of yourself. But the love that this person brought you\u2026did not leave, for the essence of the soul lingers. It cannot escape your heart, for it has been there forever.\u201d Debbie Burton Eva is survived by her beloved husband, Hans Kristian Rausing, their  four children, her sister, Be, and parents, Nancy and Tom Kemeny and an extended American and Swedish family.   O, G-d, full of compassion. Thou who dwellest on high, grant perfect rest beneath the shelter of Thy divine presence among the holy and pure who shine as the brightness of the firmament to the soul of my beloved Eva who has gone to her eternal home.  Mayest Thou, O G-d of Mercy, shelter her forever under the wings of Thy presence, May her soul be bound up in the bond of life eternal, and grant that the memories of my life inspire me always to noble and consecrated living. Amen.  Please send comments, questions, shared experiences to: addictionhelp2012@gmail.com  "

        "content": "Golfers dream of winning their first major title \u2013 it brings not only money, fame and a place in the history books, but also the confidence that more success will follow. David Duval, however, might disagree. Back in 2001, the American was celebrating his first major championship, delivering an unexpectedly emotional speech at Royal Lytham & St. Annes after his breakthrough win at the British Open. However, he\u2019s still waiting for his next top-level victory, having fallen from the summit of the world rankings to 750th this season after making the halfway cut in just two of 12 starts on the PGA Tour. His last win of any kind was on his 30th birthday at a Japan Tour event in November 2001. It\u2019s grim reading for a man who once shot the holy grail of 59, who has won 13 times on the U.S. circuit and is 40th in the PGA Tour\u2019s all-time standings with tournament earnings of almost $19 million.  \u201cWell, a lot of it really comes from injury, when you\u2019re fighting a nagging back injury,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Living Golf show ahead of this week\u2019s return to the English course where he entered his name alongside those of golfing greats. \u201cIt\u2019s still a problem. It\u2019s been 12 years now, started before that year, started in 2000, I\u2019ve had tendonitis in my shoulders, my wrists, had some knee problems. \u201cAs a professional golfer you get used to playing with some aches and pains, but when you\u2019re playing with aches and pains that impede what you\u2019re trying to do it becomes that much more difficult and it can wreck form. \u201cAnd my form was wrecked \u2013 you start hitting the ball crooked and your confidence gets wrecked.\u201d Against all odds Despite his long wait for another victory, Duval still holds out hope that he can again lift a trophy.  He will make history if he does succeed at Royal Lytham \u2013 the longest gap between British Open victories is 11 years, when Henry Cotton won his second title in 1937 and third in 48.  For those not affected by World War II, when no tournaments were played, the mark is nine years \u2013 most recently achieved by Gary Player (1959-1968). \u201cI still have it in me. It hasn\u2019t always lined up as often as it did 10 years ago, but that comes when you lose a bit of confidence \u2013 you get hurt, and it\u2019s hard to stay on that path,\u201d Duval said.  \u201cI\u2019ve put in the time, I\u2019ve put in the effort. I still have the desire, so I think it could be another great week for me.\u201d   Turning back time Duval rolled back the years when he tied for second at the 2009 U.S. Open, but he has not made the cut at the British major since tying for 39th the previous year. \u201cI\u2019ve been working very hard and I feel good about what I\u2019ve been doing and I feel good about my chances at Lytham this year,\u201d the 40-year-old said.  \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to getting there and playing, and there\u2019s no reason I can\u2019t start over where I got started.\u201d Duval won by three shots in 2001, and stunned the gallery when he took off his trademark sunglasses and cap to make a heartfelt victory speech. \u201cIt just came to me. I\u2019d been playing (the British Open) since \u201995, and this year will be my 16th.  My first experience over there at the Scottish Open at Carnoustie before the \u201895 Open at St. Andrews was a real eye-opener for me,\u201d he recalled.  \u201cThe galleries seemed to be that much more knowledgeable about the game, about the difficulty of shots you were facing, and I just kind of took it all in. \u201cJust because I wore a hat down low with sunglasses doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t be a nice person, you know I do it for a reason, and I just took them off, had an opportunity to and talked \u2013 and it really did hit me just some of the experiences I\u2019d had over the years there.\u201d Future\u2019s so bright, gotta wear shades No matter the gloomy British weather, expect to see Duval back in shades and hat for the July 19-22 tournament in Lancashire. \u201cFor some reason my eyes seem very sensitive to the light, and I always felt that it\u2019s easier to play golf like this than with your eyes squinting, to have them open all the way,\u201d he said.  \u201cI wear contacts when I play. In college I kept getting a lot of dust and pollen in my eyes \u2013 it was an issue and I was the only one to wear contacts \u2013 and that was the impetus to put on a pair of sunglasses.\u201d Duval expects Lytham\u2019s bunker-filled fairways to again pose a major test for the world\u2019s top golfers. \u201cI don\u2019t think it has kind of the reputation or fame of some of the other venues they have \u2013 I\u2019m not quite sure why,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe year I won I shot 10 under par and won by three strokes, and we had pretty nice weather, and I think that goes to the strength, the difficulty and the challenge of the golf course. You really do have to place the golf ball around. \u201cYou have to go around the golf course like that, knowing what you\u2019re trying to do, knowing why you\u2019re trying to do that, and stick to it.\u201d"

        "content": "Tiger Woods has warned the conditions at Royal Lytham make the course \u201calmost unplayable.\u201d Woods was speaking after his first practice round ahead of this week\u2019s British Open at Royal Lytham. Preparations for the tournament have been disrupted by poor weather across Britain, with the ground staff struggling to cut the grass in some areas due to the sodden course.  Woods, a three-time British Open champion, explained, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the rough this high or thick and dense. You can\u2019t get out of it. That bottom six inches, in some places, is almost unplayable.\u201d Despite the heavy rain and wind Woods is looking forward to returning to the English links course which last hosted the tournament in 2001. \u201cLytham is certainly up there. I like the layout. It\u2019s fair. They don\u2019t have to trick it up. They don\u2019t have to do anything with it. They can play it as the members play it and it would still be difficult. It\u2019s not that long. Why U.S. golf has a healthy future Woods suggested that the conditions will affect the way players approach the course, \u201cIf it\u2019s calm, we can shoot some good scores. If it\u2019s wet, lush, you\u2019ve got to be more aggressive\u201d Defending champion Darren Clarke echoed Woods\u2019 comments, describing the course as, \u201creally tough.\u201d The Northern Irishman said, \u201cThere are a few patches out there where it\u2019s just absolutely brutal. The grass is a little bit thicker than what you normally find on a links golf course. It\u2019s really, really tough.\u201d Clarke, who has been struggling for form since his victory last year, warned, \u201cIf you start spraying the ball around this week, you might as well go home. Obviously, you start missing the fairways there; you\u2019re really going to struggle so it\u2019s a big challenge.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a huge premium on accuracy this week. There\u2019s no chance coming out of this rough at all.\u201d The event\u2019s organizers insisted the course was playable, despite the awful weather conditions on the Fylde coast, north of Manchester.  Royal &  Ancient\u2019s communications director Malcolm Booth told Press Association sport, \u201cA large number of players have expressed how pleased they are with the course set-up, which seems to be very positive.\u201d Booth admitted that the rough was \u201cvery thick in places\u201d due to the \u201cunprecedented\u201d weather Britain has endured this summer. He assured players and spectators that the R&A was \u201cpleased with the course set-up.\u201d \u201cThe fairways are suitably scaled to allow a generous landing area if you are hitting the right club off the tee. The weather will keep the fairways softer too so things aren\u2019t going to be kicking off fairways with quite the force they would have.\u201d "

        "content": "A worldwide Jewish rights organization is pushing Hungarian authorities to prosecute a man it claims is a Nazi war criminal, recently discovered in Budapest, Hungary, who allegedly sent more than 15,000 Jews to Auschwitz in the spring of 1944. The Simon Wiesenthal Center found Ladislaus Csizsik-Csatary as part of its \u201cLast Chance\u201d project, said Efraim Zuroff, director of the center\u2019s Israel office.  The center cooperated with British tabloid The Sun to photograph Csizsik-Csatary, who reportedly is 97, and ask him questions, Zuroff said. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who found him; they\u2019re the ones who photographed him.\u201d Csizsik-Csatary served as a senior Hungarian police officer in the city of Kosice, which is now in Slovakia but was under Hungarian rule in the 1940s, the center said. He topped the Wiesenthal Center\u2019s 2012 list of most wanted Nazi war criminals. \u201cHe was a commander of a ghetto,\u201d Zuroff told CNN. Report: Hitler ordered reprieve for Jewish man Csizsik-Csatary participated in the deportation of 15,700 Jews to the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1944, witnesses have told the center. He also played a role in \u201cdeportations to the Ukraine to be killed \u2013 300 Jews,\u201d Zuroff said. \u201cWe found eyewitnesses on three different continents,\u201d Zuroff said. Those witnesses told the center about Csizsik-Csatary\u2019s cruelty to Jewish detainees and his role in the deportations to Auschwitz and Ukraine. Confronted by a Sun reporter, Csizsik-Csatary denied the allegations, the tabloid reported Sunday. A witness to the August 1941 Ukraine deportations had nine family members who were deported, he told CNN. Csizsik-Csatary made sure four of them were brought back from forced labor with the Hungarian army so they would be deported and killed, according to Zuroff. During the Auschwitz deportations, Csizsik-Csatary \u201cforced these girls to dig a ditch with their hands \u2013 young Jewish girls.\u201d Two of the center\u2019s witnesses were survivors of that deportation, he said.  According to The Sun, which cited documents released by the Wiesenthal Center, Csizsik-Csatary beat Jewish women with a whip he carried on his belt. \u201cA variety of factors\u201d led to the center\u2019s locating Csizsik-Csatary in Budapest, Zuroff said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t hiding under a false name. \u2026 He had no reason to fear.\u201d Using the last name Csizsik, Csizsik-Csatary arrived in Canada in 1949, telling immigration officials he was Yugoslavian, according to The Toronto Star newspaper. A spokeswoman for Canada\u2019s Department of Justice, Carole Saindon, said Monday that \u201cIt was alleged that when applying to immigrate to Canada, (Csizsik-Csatary) provided false information about his nationality, and failed to provide information concerning his collaboration with Nazi occupation forces while serving with the Royal Hungarian Police. It was further alleged that he participated in the internment and deportation of thousands of Hungarian Jews to concentration camps. As a result, the government of Canada revoked his citizenship on August 28, 1997. As deportation proceedings were under way, Csizsik-Csatary voluntarily left the country, Saindon said in an e-mail to CNN. In October 1997, Paul Vickery, head of the Canadian Justice Department\u2019s war crimes unit, told Radio Free Europe that when officials went to Csizsik-Csatary\u2019s Toronto home, his daughter told them he was living in Europe. Vickery told the network Csizsik-Csatary\u2019s name would be placed on a watch list and he would be barred from re-entering Canada. Csizsik-Csatary initially denied the allegations and asked the Canadian government to put the case on trial, but later withdrew that request, The Toronto Star reported in August 1997. \u201cIn his statement of defense, Csizsik-Csatary admitted to some involvement in the ghettoization of Jews, to handing over at least two Jews to the Germans and to attending the last mass deportation of Jews out of Kassa (Hungary),\u201d the Star said. The Sun said in its Sunday report that Csizsik-Csatary\u2019s attorneys claimed he did not know where the Jews were being sent. Of the 12,000 Jews transferred from a ghetto to a brickyard and deported, only 450 survived, the Sun reported. Csizsik-Csatary returned to Hungary upon leaving Canada, Zuroff said. \u201cHungarian authorities knew that he was back,\u201d he said. Authorities in Hungary launched an investigation in September 2011 after receiving information from Zuroff regarding Csizsik-Csatary\u2019s residence in Budapest and his role in the Auschwitz deportations, the center said.  The Sun reported Sunday that when a reporter knocked on the door of Csizsik-Csatary\u2019s two-bedroom Budapest apartment and asked him if he could justify his past, \u201cHe looked shocked and stammered, \u2018No, no. Go away.\u2019\u201d Asked about the deportation case in Canada, the Sun said he replied, \u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t want to discuss it.\u201d The Sun reporter asked, \u201cDo you deny doing it? A lot of people died as a result of your actions,\u201d according to the report. Csizsik-Csatary replied, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t do it. Go away from here,\u201d and slammed the door, according to the newspaper. The Simon Wiesenthal Center said in a statement Sunday that Zuroff last week submitted new evidence to a Budapest prosecutor regarding Csizsik-Csatary and his \u201ckey role in the deportation of approximately 300 Jews from Kosice to Kamenetz-Podolsk, Ukraine, where almost all were murdered in the summer of 1941.\u201d \u201cThis new evidence strengthens the already very strong case against Csatary and reinforces our insistence that he be held accountable for his crimes,\u201d Zuroff said in the statement. \u201cThe passage of time in no way diminishes his guilt and old age should not afford protection for Holocaust perpetrators.\u201d Csizsik-Csatary reportedly was convicted of war crimes in absentia and sentenced to death in 1948 in the Czech Republic, Zuroff said, but the center has not obtained documentation on the case."

        "content": "Roger Federer\u2019s reputation as one of the finest tennis players of all time was cemented on Monday, as the Swiss broke Pete Sampras\u2019 record for the most number of weeks at the top of the world rankings. Federer returned to the No. 1 spot for the first time in over two years with a record-equaling seventh Wimbledon men\u2019s singles triumph, a victory which was also gave him an unparalleled 17th grand slam title. The 30-year-old has now spent 287 weeks at the summit since turning pro in 1998, one more than 14-time grand slam winner Sampras managed between 1993 and 2000. By comparison, Steffi Graf holds the women\u2019s record total of 377 weeks at No. 1, with Martina Navratilova second on 332. \u201cIt is really an amazing feeling for me to have regained the No. 1 ranking,\u201d Federer said on the ATP Tour website.  \u201cI had set a goal with my team to try to get back to the top of the rankings, but I never thought with the depth in the game this year that I would have been able to get it back so quickly.  \u201cI am extremely proud and honored to have beaten Pete\u2019s record as he was my childhood hero and I have always looked up to him.\u201d Sampras, who retired in 2002, congratulated Federer on his achievement. \u201cGreat effort. The hardest thing to do in sports is the ability to stay on top. Roger has been able to do so by great play and durability,\u201d the American said. Behind Federer and Sampras on the list are eight-time grand slam winners Ivan Lendl (270 weeks) and Jimmy Connors (268 weeks) while John McEnroe, a winner of seven major titles, was at the top for 170 weeks. Federer is \u201cthe greatest ever tennis player\u201d Despite dropping out of the top three in October 2011, Federer has still maintained his incredible run of reaching 33 grand slam semifinals in a row stretching back to the 2004 French Open. Federer spent a record 237 consecutive weeks at No. 1 between February 2004 and August 2008, whereas Sampras only managed 102 weeks in a row. One record Federer is yet to claim is that of the oldest man to win a major. Andre Agassi achieved that feat by winning the 2003 Australian Open at the age of 33 years and 131 days. In the women\u2019s game, Wimbledon champion Serena Williams equaled older sister Venus\u2019 total of 43 WTA Tour titles by beating fellow American Coco Vandeweghe in Sunday\u2019s final of the Bank of The West Classic in California. The dominant Williams sisters now share the record for the most tournaments won by players still active. The 30-year-old Serena has won 28 of her last 29 matches and is now joint sixth on the all-time list of WTA Tour title winners. The legendary Czech Martina Navratilova tops the list with 167 titles, ahead of American Chris Evert with 154. Germany\u2019s Graf, the wife of Agassi, has 107, while Lindsay Davenport of the U.S. collected 55 titles during her career. The Williams sisters are level with Switzerland\u2019s Martina Hingis and Justine Henin of Belgium. For former world No. 1 Serena, her recent run of form comes off the back of a 2011 season which was blighted by life-threatening blood clots on her lung. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt this fit, this strong, this happy to play \u2013 and I think I can be even better,\u201d fourth-ranked Williams told the WTA Tour\u2019s website after her 7-5 6-3 win over the 20-year-old Vandeweghe, who made it into the main draw as a lucky loser from qualifying.  \u201cI want to sustain this momentum and build on what I did at Wimbledon. I\u2019m going to get back on the grass now for the Olympics \u2013 I\u2019m not sure when I\u2019m heading back to London, but I\u2019ll do it as soon as I can.\u201d Williams will be looking to win her third gold medal in the British capital, after clinching the doubles title alongside Venus at the 2000 and 2008 Games.

        "content": "Indian golfer Jeev Milkha Singh claimed his fourth European Tour career title on Sunday after winning a playoff against Italy\u2019s Francesco Molinari at the Scottish Open. The 40-year-old snatched victory with a birdie at the first extra hole to overhaul Molinari, who had started the final round at the Castle Stuart Golf Links with a one-stroke lead.  The win also means Singh has booked a place at the Open Championship which starts on Thursday. \u201cI think God has been kind, and I think the field came back and I put myself in a position to go in for a playoff \u2013 I\u2019m very fortunate,\u201d Singh said on the European Tour website. Singh has struggled with frustrating back problems in recent years.  \u201cYou feel like your game is coming back and another injury creeps up, but I just stuck myself in there and said that you need to work on the physical side, and I worked hard on that,\u201d he said.  \u201cEverything has paid off, and I just want to think about the good things and not what\u2019s past and I want to look towards the future now.\u201d    Singh started the day five shots off the lead but clawed his way back into contention with a five-under-par round of 67 to finish the tournament on 17 under.  Molinari shot a final-round 72, securing a playoff with a birdie at the 72nd hole. But the Italian couldn\u2019t repeat the feat on the same green a few minutes later, leaving his birdie putt short before Singh holed out from 15 feet to claim the \u20ac518,046 ($635,000) first prize.  Molinari, who also finished runnerup at last weekend\u2019s French Open, will be hoping he can go one better at Royal Lytham & St. Annes next week.  Earlier, Scotland\u2019s Marc Warren had held a two-stroke lead with three holes to play, but a three-putt contributed to a double bogey at the 16th which he followed with a bogey at the 17th.  He would eventually finish joint-third with Sweden\u2019s Alexander Noren (70) on 16 under par. England\u2019s Matthew Baldwin finished a shot further back on 15-under par tied with Soren Kjeldsen from Denmark and France\u2019s Thomas Levet. American Phil Mickelson had a disappointing final round of 74, dropping back to tie for 16th.  The four-time major champion was in good company though. England\u2019s world No. 1 Luke Donald (73) finished the tournament on the same total, as did Ireland\u2019s Padraig Harrington (71) \u2013 who will be looking to win a third Open Championship after his back-to-back successes in 2007 and 2008.   American golfer Zach Johnson earned a place the British Open after winning the PGA Tour\u2019s John Deere Classic in a playoff against Troy Matteson, who will also line up at Royal Lytham. Johnson, the 2007 Masters champion who tied for 16th at Royal St. George\u2019s last year, won on the second hole with a birdie after a remarkable approach shot from the bunker. The 36-year-old, who is on the board of directors for his home tournament, surged into the lead with a six-under 65 on Sunday but Matteson \u2013 who had led from the first round \u2013 made up for a double bogey at 15 as he eagled 17 and forced the playoff with his 69. Matteson, who will make his British Open debut, has lost two of his three playoffs on the American circuit. His only victories have both come at the Las Vegas Fall Series event now run by Justin Timberlake. Steve Stricker missed out on becoming only the fifth player to win a PGA Tour tournament four successive times, finishing tied for fifth.  "

        "content": "British government ministers fought back Sunday against accusations they had taken their eye off the Olympic security ball, rejecting accusations they were warned nearly a year ago about the security giant contracted to provide guards for the Games. G4S, the security contractor, admitted on Wednesday that it would not be able to provide more than 10,000 security staffers by the time the Olympics begin in less than two weeks. The government hurriedly announced it would bring in 3,500 military personnel to boost security for the Games. Sports Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Sunday it should be no surprise that some contractors were unable to meet their commitments. \u201cIt\u2019s completely normal that you\u2019re going to find some contractors on a project of this size who aren\u2019t going to be able to deliver what they promised,\u201d he said on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show. He praised the contractor as being \u201chonorable\u201d for having admitted the problem, apologizing and covering the costs of bringing in military personnel. And he reiterated that the government learned only last week that G4S would not meet its commitment. \u201cManagement told us right up until last week that everything was on track,\u201d Hunt said. The contractor said Saturday it stands to lose up to $77 million after failing to recruit enough staff. Also on Sunday, the Home Office rejected a newspaper report that it had been cautioned about G4S in September of last year. The Home Office, which is responsible for domestic security, said it was \u201cinaccurate\u201d that a report by the police watchdog agency Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary \u201cshould have raised alarm bells about the readiness of G4S.\u201d The report \u201cinto Olympics security preparedness \u2013 which has never been published \u2013 raised serious issues over G4S last year,\u201d the Independent on Sunday said. The Home Office denied that. \u201cWhile an early inspection highlighted issues to be addressed, a report in February 2012 said that LOCOG was on track to deliver the required number of security personnel,\u201d the Home Office said in a statement. LOGOC is the London Olympic Games Organising Committee, which is running the Games. G4S chief executive Nick Buckles said Saturday he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d the firm was unable to live up to its contract with LOCOG. \u201cWe clearly took in a contract in good faith,\u201d Buckles said. \u201cWe were a vital part of securing the games. The military would have to be called in to help us through that process. We know a number of these soldiers had had to cancel leave to come back and help us with the process \u2026 we feel we caused a huge problem.\u201d Buckles acknowledged the company was at fault and said it was grateful the military is providing support. \u201cWe are sorry they had to give up leave, truly,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt is down to G4S \u2026 we were contracted to deliver staff. We should have done that.\u201d London Olympics organizer defends security contractor  The military deployment means that 17,000 military personnel will be on duty in the United Kingdom during the Games, compared with the 9,500 currently in Afghanistan. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said the security operation will not impact operations in Afghanistan, which is the main effort for the military. Some personnel who would have had leave over the Olympic period will have the leave rescheduled, the spokesman said. G4S had been expected to recruit a staff of about 10,400 as part of a total security force of 23,700 for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The staffers were to provide venue perimeter security, including manning X-ray machines, conducting spectator and vehicle searches and operating closed-circuit television, said G4S spokesman Adam Mynott. The contractor said this week that while 4,000 are already at work across 100 venues, more than 9,000 are still going through the training and vetting process. In a statement Saturday, the company said it had \u201cencountered significant difficulties in processing applicants in sufficient numbers through the necessary training, vetting and accreditation procedures.  As a result, we will be unable to deliver all of the necessary workforce numbers.\u201d UK: 3,500 extra troops called in for Olympic security That failure is likely to cost the firm between \u00a335m and \u00a350m ($54 million -$77 million), it said. G4S \u201cdeeply regrets that, despite the relentless efforts of so many of its people, it is unlikely to deliver in full its obligations to LOCOG, to the government and to everyone with an interest in these Games.\u201d Britain is on a heightened state of alert ahead of the Games, which open on July 27. Home Secretary Theresa May said Thursday that \u201cthere is no question of Olympic security being compromised.\u201d  But opposition lawmakers have described the situation as a \u201cshambles,\u201d saying it raises concerns over the government\u2019s grip on the preparations for the Olympics and Paralympics. LOCOG chairman Sebastian Coe said Friday he was \u201cextraordinarily impressed with\u201d private contractor G4S so far. Coe said he was happy with the security staff on site and that while G4S has \u201cchallenges,\u201d it would get there. Olympic organizers have agreed to give 10,000 tickets to the armed forces to compensate for the short-notice deployment, the Ministry of Defence said. The questions over security staff come as Britain gears up to welcome many of the visiting teams\u2019 officials this weekend ahead of the athletes\u2019 arrival on Monday. One headache was removed for organizers with the reopening Friday of the main highway linking Heathrow airport with central London. The busy M4 motorway had been closed for a week for emergency repairs to a viaduct. Is Olympic-level security already under way in Britain?"

        "content": "Phil Mickelson warmed up for next week\u2019s British Open by mounting a serious challenge for the Scottish Open Saturday after a third round 65 at Castle Stuart. The 42-year-old American opened with a disappointing one-over 73 but has charged through the field by playing the next two rounds in 15-under-par. But in joint fifth, he still trails leader Francesco Molinari of Italy by three shots going into the final round at the links course in Inverness. Four-time major winner Mickelson got a late invitation to compete in the European Tour event to complete final preparations for Royal Lytham and St Annes next week. \u201cI should have had it planned out originally, but there was a chance to take the kids to Italy,\u201d he told gathered reporters. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased and excited. This course is so good at getting you ready for playing links golf. It does not beat you up so much.\u201d Among the players he passed on the way was world number one and defending champion Luke Donald of England, who is a shot further back. Mickelson finished joint runner-up to Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland at Sandwich last year and is still looking to lift the Claret Jug for the first time, having played the British Open every year since 1991.    Molinari carded a 67 to reach 17-under-par, one shot clear of Dane Anders Hansen. He is bidding to emulate his brother Edoardo, who took the Scottish Open two years ago, but is sidelined by injury. If he achieves his goal it would only be the second time in European Tour history that brothers had won the same tournament. Spaniards Antonio and German Garrido took the Madrid Open title in 1977 and 1973 respectively. Scotland\u2019s Marc Warren and Soren Kjeldsen of Denmark are joint third only two back. Alex Noren of Sweden shared the halfway lead with Molinari and they were still together at the turn, but he dropped shots coming home to fall back into a tie with Mickelson, in a group which also includes American-based Scot Martin Laird and another home hope Peter Whiteford. Laird, bidding to make the European Ryder Cup team, moved into contention with an eight-under 64 in benign conditions.   "

        "content": "Several dozen protesters picketed a cultural center in Kiev, Ukraine, on Saturday as part of continued demonstrations against a controversial regional languages bill.  At least 12 people have joined a hunger strike over the past two weeks in protest of the bill, introduced in May by the ruling Party of Regions.  One student was hospitalized Saturday in life-threatening condition after seven days on hunger strike, according to Kiev Mohilyan Academy, where the young woman studies. In total, four protesters have been admitted to clinics for treatment over the past three days, Ukraine\u2019s health ministry and the protest movement said.  The protesters fear that the future of the Ukrainian language will be severely undermined by the bill, which aims to provide regional status to the 18 languages spoken by ethnic minorities in Ukraine, including Russian, Romanian and Tatar.  Under the bill, minorities would be able to have their mother tongue taught in schools and use those languages in official documents, among other benefits.  The architect of the bill \u2013 parliament deputy from the ruling party Vadim Kolesnichenko \u2013 says such legislation is necessary if Ukraine wants to become part of the European Union.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had many checks on the human rights issues in Ukraine by European organizations \u2013 and they noticed many violations. Minority languages has been one of them. Our bill is written in full compliance with the European charter for minority languages, which is aimed at preserving minority languages and protecting them,\u201d Kolesnichenko said.  The bill doesn\u2019t stipulate that Ukraine may have several official state languages \u2013 something which can be changed only through a nationwide referendum. However the opposition insists that providing even a regional status to the Russian language \u2013 widely spoken in 13 regions of the country by roughly 20 million people \u2013 would severely undermine the development of the Ukrainian language. The protesters fear that should the use of Russian be legalized, nobody would want to learn Ukrainian.  Parliament sessions in recent months on the controversial bill have erupted in fistfights between Ukraine\u2019s legislators as deputies opposing the bill clashed with those from the ruling party.  Earlier this month, the bill passed the second hearing in the Rada with 248 deputies voting for it. The opposition claims the vote was rigged and called on President Viktor Yanukovich not to ratify the bill and prevent it from becoming law. The president hasn\u2019t yet responded to those demands.  \u201cWe issued an ultimatum to the authorities to abolish this bill. There has been no intention or even a hint from President Yanukovich that he could do so. That\u2019s why our hunger strike would continue for weeks or months \u2013 as long as we are alive,\u201d said Oleksandr Mishura, a member of the protest movement.  Valeriy Shevchenko traveled to Kiev on Saturday all the way from a village in Western Ukraine to participate.  \u201cWe have to defend our language and our culture \u2013 the two things most dear to us,\u201d he said.  While protesters continue their standoff, the government is producing few comments on the matter. The final say is with Yanukovich, who is still weighing whether to put his signature on the bill, but promises to respect all sides of the conflict. But Ukraine\u2019s leader already said that if the crisis is not resolved, a dissolution of parliament and an early ballot cannot be ruled out."

        "content": "Glasgow Rangers, one of European football\u2019s most famous clubs, must play in the fourth flight of their domestic league next season, Scottish Football League (SFL) clubs decided Friday. The 30 clubs were asked to vote on admitting the most successful club in their country to the SFL and in which division they should be placed. Cash-strapped Rangers went into administration earlier this year and a new company was formed to allow them to continue as a professional team. They were subsequently expelled from the Scottish Premier League (SPL) and had to turn to the lesser SFL for next season. Why Rangers\u2019 financial meltdown should worry European football At a news conference at Glasgow\u2019s Hampden Park, it was announced that 25 of the 30 clubs had voted for Rangers to start the 2012-13 season in the SFL Third Division. \u201cIt has been a very, very important day for Scottish football,\u201d SFL chief executive David Longmuir told a press conference. \u201cWe have voted to willingly accept Rangers as an associate member of the SFL (29 out of 30 clubs in favor)  \u201cThe only acceptable position will be to place Rangers FC into the Third Division from that start of this season, 2012/13. This decision followed a tried and tested process \u201cToday\u2019s decision has been one of the most difficult for all concerned but it has been taken in the best interest of sporting fairness, which is the fundamental principle of the SFL.\u201d But that decision is likely to have severe financial implications for Scottish football, which has struggled to attract the cash lavished on the English Premier League (EPL) south of the border.  As one of its two great clubs, part of the famous \u201cOld Firm\u201d with Glasgow rivals Celtic, was facing up to years in the wilderness, the EPL sealed a sponsorship deal with Barclays Bank worth \u00a340 million ($62.18 million). The three year deal is a near 50 per cent increase on the previous sums paid by Barclays and follows a month after the EPL improved a 70 per cent increase in the value of its domestic television rights to more than \u00a33 billion ($4.67B) over three years to 2016. By contrast, the sponsorship and television deals for Scottish football are comparatively modest.  A new five year television deal for the SPL, starting from the 2012-13 season, will bring in \u00a380 million ($124.5m). Derby matches between Rangers and Celtic, who traditionally battle for the honors in the SPL, are the main attraction for Scottish football fans and armchair viewers. Reports have suggested that the new TV deal may even founder if a certain number of Old Firm matches cannot be guaranteed. Rangers have also been regulars in the European Champions League since its inception. They won the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup in 1972 and as recently as 2008 were runners-up in the UEFA Cup (Now Europa League). SPL chief executive Neil Doncaster and his Scottish Football Association counterpart Stewart Regan both lobbied for Rangers to be placed in the SFL Division One so they could secure a quick return to the top flight, but their pleas were ignored. Rangers went into administration on February 14 this year following court action from UK tax officials. Businessman Charles Green purchased the assets of the club for \u00a35.5 million ($8.55m) and they were transferred into a new company in June. Several leading players have since left the 54-time Scottish champions, claiming their contracts were effectively annulled when the new company was founded.  Reacting to the SFL decision, Green said:  \u201cWe are grateful to be accepted as members of the SFL and accept their decision to vote us into Division 3.     \u201cThis decision maintains the sporting integrity that clubs and fans across Scotland have been calling for but it also impacts massively on Scottish football as a whole and only time will tell what the consequences will be.  \u201cWe are a football club and we just want to get back to playing football. Now is the time to move on and start afresh.\u201d  "

G4S chief executive Nick Buckles said he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d the firm was unable to live up to its contract with the London 2012 organizing group, LOCOG. The company has come under heavy scrutiny this week after the government was forced to announce the deployment of 3,500 extra military personnel to cover the shortfall. London Olympics organizer defends security contractor  The deployment means that 17,000 troops will be on duty in the United Kingdom during the Games, compared with the 9,500 currently in Afghanistan. G4S had been expected to recruit a staff of about 10,400 as part of a total security force of 23,700 for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The contractor said this week that while 4,000 are already at work across 100 venues, more than 9,000 are still going through the training and vetting process. In a statement Saturday, the company said it had \u201cencountered significant difficulties in processing applicants in sufficient numbers through the necessary training, vetting and accreditation procedures.  As a result, we will be unable to deliver all of the necessary workforce numbers.\u201d UK: 3,500 extra troops called in for Olympic security That failure is likely to cost the firm between \u00a335m and \u00a350m ($54 million -$77 million), it said. G4S \u201cdeeply regrets that, despite the relentless efforts of so many of its people, it is unlikely to deliver in full its obligations to LOCOG, to the government and to everyone with an interest in these Games.\u201d The company will meet the cost of the additional military deployment, it said, and \u201cis also incurring other significant costs as it endeavours to meet the contract challenges.\u201d It also expressed its gratitude to those military personnel who will be deployed on short notice to fill the gap. \u201cIn partnership with the military and LOCOG, we are working flat out around the clock to resolve the situation.  We are determined that together we will deliver a successful and secure Games,\u201d Nick Buckles said, quoted in the statement. Britain is on a heightened state of alert ahead of the Games, which open on July 27. Home Secretary Theresa May said Thursday that \u201cthere is no question of Olympic security being compromised.\u201d  But opposition lawmakers have described the situation as a \u201cshambles,\u201d saying it raises concerns over the government\u2019s grip on the preparations for the Olympics and Paralympics. LOCOG chairman Sebastian Coe said Friday he was \u201cextraordinarily impressed with\u201d private contractor G4S so far. Coe said he was happy with the security staff on site and that while G4S has \u201cchallenges,\u201d it would get there. Olympic organizers have agreed to give 10,000 tickets to the armed forces to compensate for the short-notice deployment, the Ministry of Defence said. The questions over security staff come as Britain gears up to welcome many of the visiting teams\u2019 officials this weekend ahead of the athletes\u2019 arrival on Monday. One headache was removed for organizers with the reopening Friday of the main highway linking Heathrow airport with central London. The busy M4 motorway had been closed for a week for emergency repairs to a viaduct. Is Olympic-level security already under way in Britain?"

        "content": "John Terry, one of England\u2019s biggest soccer stars, was found not guilty Friday of racially abusing fellow soccer player Anton Ferdinand, ending a high-profile trial in London. Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle said of Terry: \u201cNo one has been able to show that he is lying.\u201d Reading his ruling, Riddle said it was a crucial fact that no one heard what Terry said. Terry, the Chelsea captain, sat impassively in the courtroom as the verdict was read out at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court. It was greeted by cheers from the public gallery. What\u2019s your reaction to the verdict? Have your say on iReport Riddle said he accepted it was possible that Terry himself thought Ferdinand had accused him of using racial abuse. But he also said he considered it \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that Ferdinand had accused Terry of calling him a \u201cblack c\u2014.\u201d Terry, who has received strong backing from Chelsea Football Club throughout the trial, left the court without addressing the public or media. A statement issued on behalf of Terry by his legal team said he had been acquitted of all charges. \u201cHe did not racially abuse Mr. Ferdinand and the court has accepted this. John would like to thank his legal team for their hard work and his family, friends and Chelsea Football Club for their support,\u201d the statement said. Chelsea\u2019s chairman, Bruce Buck, welcomed the verdict, saying: \u201cWe at Chelsea are pleased that John Terry can now put his mind back to football.\u201d The football club also said it respects the magistrate\u2019s decision to clear Terry. \u201cWe are pleased that John can now focus on football and his preseason preparations with the team,\u201d it said in a statement on the official Chelsea website. The English Football Association, which could still open its own disciplinary proceedings against Terry, said it noted the court\u2019s verdict and would \u201cnow seek to conclude its own enquiries.\u201d Alison Saunders, chief crown prosecutor for London, defended the decision to bring the case to trial. \u201cThe very serious allegation at the heart of this case was one of racial abuse. It was our view that this was not \u2018banter\u2019 on the football pitch and that the allegation should be judged by a court,\u201d she said in a prepared statement. \u201cThe chief magistrate agreed that Mr. Terry had a case to answer, but having heard all of the evidence he acquitted Mr. Terry of a racially aggravated offense. That is justice being done and we respect the chief magistrate\u2019s decision.\u201d The weeklong trial, during which the normally staid chambers got an earful of shockingly foul language, gripped the British press. Terry, who was captain of the England national team at the time of the incident, was accused of calling Ferdinand, who plays for Queens Park Rangers, a \u201cf\u2014\u2014 black c\u2014\u201d as the pair traded insults during a game last October. Terry did not deny directing a barrage of foul language at Ferdinand and referring to him as \u201cblack,\u201d but he denied engaging in racist abuse. He told the court that he was repeating what he mistakenly thought Ferdinand had accused him of saying. The highly unusual criminal prosecution over words uttered on a soccer field comes as English soccer officials fight to stamp racism out of the sport, with mixed results. Lord Herman Ouseley, the chairman of UK football\u2019s anti-racism campaign, Kick It Out, said it would wait to hear the conclusions of the Football Association with regard to the Terry case. \u201cIt will be interesting to hear from other organizations this will impact on, from governing bodies to leagues and clubs, and how they deem matters like this to be dealt with in the future,\u201d he said in a statement. Terry was stripped of his England captaincy after a preliminary court hearing on the racism charge in February."

The 49-year-old was initially arrested Monday on drug charges and then was held \u201cin connection with the death\u201d of Eva Rausing, police said Tuesday.  The new details of his arrest emerged during the inquest into her death, which opened at Westminster Coroner\u2019s Court on Friday. The Metropolitan Police said there is no murder inquiry yet and the death is still being treated as unexplained. Authorities are awaiting the results of further post-mortem tests, which are not expected for several more days, police said. An autopsy Tuesday failed to determine the cause of Eva Rausing\u2019s death, police said.

        "content": "For sale: One football club, formerly the best in Europe, now fallen on hard times. Buyer: Rich Middle Eastern family, determined to restore club\u2019s \u201cglory days.\u201d When it was announced this week that a Kuwaiti family had agreed to take over Nottingham Forest, two-time winner of the European Cup, the big question became: Is this another Manchester City or Chelsea \u2013 or more evidence of football\u2019s \u201cprune juice\u201d theory? For every Sheikh Mansour and Roman Abramovich, there is a Sulaiman al-Fahim or Venky\u2019s to prove that money pumped into one end of a club generally comes straight out the other. Indeed, Forest \u2013 last a member of England\u2019s top division as long ago as 1999 \u2013 reportedly required more than $100 million of investment from Nigel Doughty during his 13-year spell as owner. How much is Manchester City\u2019s victory worth for Abu Dhabi? That might not seem like a lot for a Premier League team, but for one that last season only narrowly avoided a return to the third tier, it\u2019s a significant amount. However, the Al-Hasawi family could potentially achieve a much greater return on their investment at Forest than, say, the series of money men who have followed in Al Fahim\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to make capital out of former EPL side Portsmouth. \u201cFinancial interest from the Middle East has fallen into two camps: the genuine and the fantasists,\u201d Middle Eastern football expert James Montague told CNN.  \u201cYou have on one hand the likes of Sheikh Mansour who bought Manchester City, put his money where his mouth is and within four years has transformed the club from also-rans into title winners. They are now feared across Europe. Arabian dreams: Abu Dhabi celebrates City\u2019s title triumph \u201cOn the other you have a string of failed takeovers from those hoping Middle Eastern money could be some kind of panacea. Or in the case of Portsmouth were taken over by the UAE\u2019s Sulaiman al Fahim and eventually became the first Premier League club to go into administration. \u201cThis takeover appears to fall in to the former category, largely because they have a successful track record in domestic football. Remember, Manchester City wasn\u2019t the first club Sheikh Mansour bankrolled. His first love is the Abu Dhabi-based club Al Jazira. Likewise the Hasawi family have turned Kuwaiti club Qadisa into a local regional powerhouse.\u201d While Portsmouth\u2019s only English titles date back to 1949-50, Forest won the old first division championship relatively recently in 1978 and then shocked the football world by lifting Europe\u2019s top club trophy in the following two seasons.  Will football clubs play fair financially? \u201cIt makes a great deal of sense for an investor to buy into a club of Forest\u2019s stature,\u201d says Simon Chadwick, professor of sport business strategy and marketing at England\u2019s Coventry University. \u201cThere is some equity in the brand amongst fans and potential fans that dates back to their successes in the late \u201970s and early \u201880s. This brand equity can offer things to customers and investors that other organizations can\u2019t.\u201d Forest\u2019s near neighbor Leicester City, another club to have lost top-flight status in recent years, is now owned by a Thai group \u2013 but Chadwick says there is a big difference in their earning potential.  \u201cForest\u2019s financial position, while not being especially strong, is more stable than it has been over the past five years or so,\u201d he said.  \u201cFor people like the Al-Hasawi family, it depends on what their view of the club is. If they see it as a revenue-generating asset, clearly it\u2019s going to take a great deal of hard work to build those revenue streams.  \u201cIt\u2019s there where Forest\u2019s history and equity of the brand can have an impact. Forest can deliver a level of revenue that their closest geographic rivals Leicester City can\u2019t. Nottingham has a significant population so in terms of being able to fill a stadium, in terms of latent fan base, it\u2019s very significant.\u201d French revolution: Can Qatari cash make PSG a football force? Foreign investors once flocked to the lucrative but highly expensive Premier League \u2013 Manchester United was reportedly valued at \u00a31 billion when the Qatari royal family was linked with the club \u2013  but the second-tier Championship is now proving to be more value for money. \u201cSheikh Mansour saw that you needed to find undervalued clubs with history and prestige,\u201d said Montague, author of \u201cWhen Friday Comes: Football in the War Zone.\u201d \u201cCity fit the bill, and in a way Forest has even more potential. We drool at clubs like Barcelona, Manchester United and Inter Milan winning the Champions League, but Forest won back-to-back European Cups just over 30 years ago and had one of the most iconic managers \u2013 Brian Clough \u2013 in charge.  \u201cA whole industry has boomed over Clough \u2013 biographies, novels, films. For the reported \u00a320 million ($31 million), the Hasawi family are getting former European champions with Hollywood-level exposure for a snip.\u201d Earlier this year, a Russian group agreed to buy Reading months before the club\u2019s promotion to the top flight, while Italians have bought Watford, Malaysians control Cardiff, Hong Kong\u2019s Carson Yeung owns Birmingham, a North American group has Derby County and an Egypt-born UK businessman has taken over Hull. PSG\u2019s Qatari owners aim to be world\u2019s best \u201cIt makes the competition for players more intense, the competition for spectators more intense,\u201d Chadwick told CNN. \u201cWhereas maybe five or 10 years ago the involvement of a rich investor might have been seen as the right ingredient for success, I think now such is the level of interest in English football and such is the level of investment, it\u2019s now much more about managerial competence and skill and knowledge of the industry and networking.\u201d Doughty brought in former England manager Steve McClaren at the start of last season with disastrous results, and the current FC Twente coach\u2019s short reign resulted in the Forest benefactor \u2013 considered one of the most powerful men in UK business \u2013 standing down as chairman.  Doughty put the club up for sale, but the Al-Hasawis dealt with the executors of his estate following the investment banker\u2019s death at the age of 54 in February. They issued a statement stating their goal to \u201cbring the Reds back to the top of the table\u201d but acknowledged \u201cchallenging times ahead\u201d \u2013 and have already sacked manager Steve Cotterill just nine months into his three-and-a-half-year contract. \u201cIf the family is looking at this on a medium to longer term basis, they\u2019ll look to develop a scouting network and sign players for relatively small amounts of money,\u201d Chadwick said. \u201cThey will have to manage the club in a very shrewd way to make sure they don\u2019t get back into debt in the same way. One would hope that Forest as a club have learned their lessons.  \u201cWhen they were relegated they tried to spend their way out of trouble. They dropped further and further down the league structure, while at the same time building up their debts.\u201d Cash for cups? Qatar\u2019s sporting influence spreads across the globe If Forest fans are getting overexcited about their future, they don\u2019t have to look very far for proof that such a takeover can go horribly wrong. In 2009, city rivals Notts County announced that football\u2019s oldest professional club \u2013 languishing in the bottom division and in danger of collapsing \u2013 had been bought by a group called Munto Finance, purportedly financed by Middle East money. In came former England manager Sven Goran Eriksson and international star Sol Campbell on lucrative long-term deals, but they had both gone before the end of that season as Munto\u2019s promises to wipe out crippling debts proved empty. Still struggling to survive, the club was sold for a nominal fee of \u00a31 just months after the takeover. \u201cThere will always be this fear. The \u2018fit and proper person test\u2019 applied to new owners is not especially robust or rigorous, so we can never be completely sure about what new owners\u2019 intentions or resources are,\u201d Chadwick said.  \u201cUntil we get into this period of ownership, it won\u2019t be entirely clear what they are able to do.\u201d From riches to rags: Why Rangers\u2019 financial meltdown should worry Europe He cited the example of Blackburn Rovers, who suffered relegation from the EPL after only one season under the ownership of Indian chicken magnates Venky\u2019s. \u201cThe experience since they took over is a stark illustration of how inexperience can cause problems. No matter your intentions or how much money you\u2019ve got, experience of the industry is very important,\u201d Chadwick said.  \u201cDo they know what they\u2019re letting themselves in for? Running a football club is very different from running other forms of business.  \u201cWhat do they see as being the strategic position at Forest? If they are looking to win the Premier League and get in the Champions League, they are going to have to invest a significant amount of money.  \u201cBut if their definition of glory days is to get back into the Premier League then it will require a more modest sum. Stoke. have proved you can establish yourself as a midtable team. It\u2019s still very expensive, but not as expensive as what City have spent to win the title.\u201d"

Defending champion, and world number one, Luke Donald carded a five-under-par 67 to trail the Italian by five shots Thursday.  Molinari is continuing his great form from the French Open, where he finished second, to put himself amongst the contenders for next week\u2019s British Open as well as cementing his place in the Ryder Cup team.  On his recent form, the Italian admitted, \u201cI know it\u2019s not going to last forever, but I hope to keep this going a little bit longer \u2013 obviously next week, but the next month or so is really big for the Ryder Cup. That, probably more than the Open, is in my mind.\u201d Molinari shot 10 birdies as he stormed into the lead and he later dedicated the performance to his brother, Edoardo.  The older Molinari recently had wrist surgery and is likely to miss the entire summer. Francesco said afterwards, \u201cIt would be nice to do well this week for him as well \u2013 to cheer him up a little bit.\u201d Englishman Luke Donald was making his first appearance since his U.S. Open disaster, when he missed the cut after finishing 11 over from 36 holes.  Donald told AFP: \u201cOverall, it\u2019s a pretty satisfying start after being away from the game for three weeks so to come back and find some form pretty early on is encouraging.\u201d  Like the Italian leader, American Phil Mickelson will have an eye on September\u2019s Ryder Cup, but endured a round to forget on the links course.  The big American has left his family on holiday in Italy to get some more playing time ahead of Royal Lytham, but his 73 left him 11 shots behind Molinari.  Last year\u2019s British Open runner-up started well with two birdies in his first three holes.  However, the 42-year-old went on to hit three bogeys and managed a seven on the 12th.  Spaniard Alejandro Canizares had a day to remember after hitting birdies on the final six holes to finish two off the lead.  Soren Kjeldsen of Denmark and Raphael Jacquelin were a further shot behind.  "

        "content": "Violence continued early Friday in mainly Catholic districts of Northern Ireland after protests began on Thursday, the main day of the annual Protestant marching season. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said \u201cat least 10 gunshots\u201d were fired at police lines in the nationalist Brompton Park area of Belfast\u2019s Ardoyne district at 12.30 a.m. Friday. Police said no-one had been wounded. Officers were also attacked with pipe bombs during the disorder, police said. Police said they were working with community representatives to restore order. Problems began Thursday in Ardoyne after a parade by the Orange Order. The march passed without a major incident, but there was tension between pro-Irish and pro-British groups as they staged rival demonstrations. Both sides hurled stones and other objects, police said. Officers were wounded in an attack from pro-Irish youths throwing petrol bombs, fireworks and bricks. The Police Service said the officers\u2019 injuries were \u201cnot life-threatening.\u201d More than 20 officers were injured, although none very seriously, police said.  \u201cA large number of petrol bombs have been thrown at police. Two arrests have been made at this stage, although this number is expected to rise in the coming days as police continue with their evidence gathering operation,\u201d a police statement said. The police also said several vehicles were set on fire and pushed at police lines. Riot police used water cannon and plastic bullets to bring the crowd under control. Sporadic violence continued for several hours. Police also reported minor clashes in a Protestant district beside Catholic Ardoyne. British loyalists there threw bricks and bottles at police. Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr, the officer in charge of the policing operation in Belfast, condemned the attacks on police.  \u201cI am angry we have this annual madness when it seems that people think the peacekeepers are a legitimate target,\u201d he said Friday. He added that a \u201csignificant number\u201d of arrests would be made to ensure those involved in the violence \u201care placed before the courts and answer for those actions.\u201d In a statement Thursday he said police were \u201cdealing with significant disorder\u201d and urged calm in the area. There was also disorder in the Northern Ireland city of Londonderry, or Derry, as many residents call it. Police said petrol bombs were thrown at officers in the Bogside area, the scene of the Bloody Sunday killings by British soldiers in 1972. Vehicles were also set alight in Derry, and a public bus was hijacked and burned in Craigavon, County Armagh. Six men aged 18 to 34 have been charged with public order offenses during disturbances in Belfast on Wednesday night."

Starting from second on the grid, the Yamaha rider quickly assumed control of the race passing his compatriot, Honda\u2019s Dani Pedrosa on the opening lap to lay the foundations for a comfortable victory.  \u201cWe made no mistakes all weekend. The start was tough but little by little I gained confidence and then when I opened a little gap I was able to relax and I cruised after that,\u201d Lorenzo said.  It was the fifth time this season that Lorenzo has taken the checkered flag and ends a run of two races without a win. Pedrosa, who won his first race of the season in Germany last weekend, held on to take second place while home favorite Andrea Dovizioso took third. \u201cWe did a good job in the race but it was very difficult with Jorge going at that pace,\u201d Pedrosa said. \u201cIt was so difficult and I couldn\u2019t catch him. Overall, though, it is a good moment and let\u2019s try and keep it like this and push hard,\u201d the Spaniard added. It wasn\u2019t such a happy day for Pedrosa\u2019s teammate, Casey Stoner.

        "content": "They are now a familiar presence in war zones, but if manufacturers have their way, skies over civilians heads will soon be busy with unmanned vehicles. Drones are currently a growth industry in the aviation sector, with scores of new companies competing for a slice of the market.  And if they can clear hurdles that currently limit their deployment in friendly air space, pilotless planes of all shapes will be taking to the air on missions to watch over us. Some of the aircraft \u2013 from devices barely bigger than a paper plane to formidable missile-sized systems operated by five-man ground crews \u2013 were on display this week at the UK\u2019s Farnborough Airshow. Although the event, held on alternate years, is one of Europe\u2019s biggest market places for traditional aircraft, a \u201cdrone zone\u201d occupies a substantial slice of the exhibition space. \u201cThere now are hundreds of companies competing for the market,\u201d said Konstantins Popkis, chief technology officer for the UAV Factory, which produces a 3.3-meter wingspan drone known as Penguin B. \u201cBut not all of them are producing reliable systems,\u201d he added.  Read more: Galactic spaceship will blast off in 2013 Reliability is likely to be a key issue for drones aimed at civilian use as the industry lobbies aviation regulators to gain access to skies that for the most part remain off-limits. Another issue is privacy. Most drones are built with surveillance in mind. Top-of-the-range systems bristle with radar and infra-red cameras that can produce detail of the ground from great distances, even in poor weather. UAV Factory\u2019s $50,000-plus Penguin B is built for more modest operations, but Popkis says many of his customers are civilians looking for monitoring capabilities. He says he has taken orders for his catapult-launched craft from military researchers, but also from scientists and commercial ventures. He says environmental campaign group Greenpeace has also acquired two for monitoring the Arctic. Penguin B, which Popkis claims has clocked a record-breaking 54-and-a-half hours of continuous flying, is competing at Farnborough with several other systems designed for similar use. Among these is the Alpi Aviation Sixton-A, which uses three helicopter-style rotors to lift a lightweight drone roughly the same diameter as a trash can lid. According to Alpi, the Sixton-A is already in use by the Italian military, but civilian use is now the target market. Read more: The iPhone-sized gadget that can pilot jet fighter crews to safety \u201cI believe the future for these things is civilian,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of hiring 10 night guards to patrol somewhere, you can use two helicopters piloted by a computer \u2013 it\u2019s much cheaper.\u201d  He said his company\u2019s drones had also been recently deployed to survey areas affected by the earthquake that hit Italy in May. Other drones on sale or display include the iStart, a new ultra-light drone that can be carried in backpack and launched by hand, and the S-25, one of a range made by Austrian firm Aerie, which take off vertically, but fly like conventional planes. Such is the growth of the drone market that it has created a secondary industry, offering training, advice and support. The Association for Unmanned Systems International holds an annual show in Las Vegas and lobbies governments for greater access to civilian skies. Andrew Duggan, managing director of Insitu Pacific, is among those hoping to expand the non-military use of his unmanned aerial vehicles. His latest system, the Integrator, succeeds an earlier aircraft that has clocked up tens of thousands of military service hours in Iraq and Afghanistan. It has also seen service monitoring marine mammals off the coast of Australia and in firefighting situations. But he says, resistance from bodies such as the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority, which earlier this year agreed to roll back some limitations on lighter drones, has curbed significant use elsewhere. Read more: High-flyers of the aviation industry \u201cThere is no aviation authority in the world that will allow you access for 24 hours,\u201d Duggan said.  He puts this partly down to the considerable bad press armed drones have attracted flying U.S. military missions over Pakistan and Afghanistan. Last week a suspected U.S. drone strike killed 20 people in northern Pakistan. \u201cA lot of it is down to the stigma around the term \u2018drone\u2019 because of incidents (in) Pakistan and Afghanistan,\u201d Duggan said. \u201cPeople are hung up over privacy, but it\u2019s a lot of unnecessary drama. They are no different from having a police helicopter over your head, or a security camera pointed at you.\u201d But there was caution at the top end of the market in Farnborough.  Matt Moore, head of unmanned aerial systems tactical planning at European defense contractor Thales, also hopes his company\u2019s new Watchkeeper system \u2013 a large and sophisticated aircraft developed for the UK military \u2013 will have a civilian life. But, he says, the only reason Watchkeeper currently enjoys limited clearance over UK civilian airspace is because some of the $1,100 million invested in its development has gone to ensure it exceeds safety requirements. This, he says, is not something that some lower-cost drone manufacturers can claim. \u201cUnlike many of these unmanned aircraft now hitting the market, the Watchkeeper is built to a standard that is better than a manned aircraft. Its computer system does not fail. It can\u2019t go wrong or fail and you won\u2019t get the computer blue screen of death.\u201d"

        "content": "FIFA president Sepp Blatter has admitted that he did know about alleged bribe payments made to former FIFA executives, but insists he didn\u2019t think they were illegal at the time.  \u201cYou can\u2019t judge the past on the basis of today\u2019s standards. Otherwise it would end up with moral justice. I can\u2019t have known about an offense that wasn\u2019t even one,\u201d he told the website of football\u2019s world governing body. A Swiss court has published its findings following an investigation into alleged illegal payments made by FIFA marketing partner International Sports and Leisure (ISL) to former FIFA president Joao Havelange and former executive committee member Ricardo Teixeira.  The report found that Havelange had received at least 1.5 million Swiss francs ($1.53 million) and Ricardo Teixeira was paid at least CHF 12.4 million ($12.64 million) from marketing partner ISL.  Blatter was FIFA\u2019s general secretary at the time of the alleged irregularities, and in that role he co-signed agreements with the marketing group.   Blatter has confirmed that he is the \u201cP1\u201d character investigators referred to in several key points of the report. The investigators specifically identified \u201cP1\u201d as someone who knew about the illegal payments.  \u201cIt was confirmed by the former chief financial officer of FIFA \u2026 that a certain payment made to Joao Havelange by the Company 1 amounting to CHF 1 million was mistakenly directly transferred to a FIFA account; not only the CFO had knowledge of this, but also, among others, P1 would also have known about it,\u201d the report stated. However, Blatter defended his involvement on the FIFA website in a move that shows the 76-year-old is making some effort to keep the promises of greater transparency he made after being re-elected in 2011. \u201cBack then, such payments could even be deducted as a business expense,\u201d he said of ISL\u2019s transactions, which were made between 1999 and the company\u2019s collapse in 2001.  \u201cToday, that would be punishable under law.\u201d  However, one of FIFA\u2019s critics insists that Blatter should take more responsibility for the ruling body\u2019s actions. \u201cThe FIFA president has a serious moral compass problem. You are looking at an organization whose culture is tolerant of impropriety,\u201d David Larkin, co-director of campaign group Change FIFA, told CNN.  \u201cThe president is trying to defend acts that would not be tolerated anywhere else.\u201d FIFA has been keen to point to its active involvement in the case, declaring on Wednesday in a response to the document\u2019s publication: \u201cThe decision by the Federal Court is in line with what FIFA and the FIFA president have been advocating since 2011, when world football\u2019s governing body announced its commitment to the publication of the ISL non-prosecution order.\u201d Blatter highlighted the formation of an Ethics Committee, an adjudicatory body and an investigatory body, and told the FIFA website that \u201csome important steps have already been taken.\u201d  However, Larkin described FIFA as \u201cthe least qualified people to investigate\u201d the allegations against it.

The American made a smooth transition from the London grass courts \u2013 which she will return to for the Olympics later this month \u2013 and an eight-hour time difference as she beat college champion Nicole Gibbs 6-2 6-1 in the second round of the hard-court event. \u201cI definitely felt a little sluggish today, but it was fine, and it was good to get that win,\u201d Williams told reporters after winning against the 19-year-old wildcard entrant to register her 25th victory in 26 matches.  \u201cIt\u2019s really bright out there too \u2013 I was so used to all the gloom in London and all the clouds  \u201cI\u2019ll feel better after having tomorrow off and more time to get adjusted. I\u2019m still waking up at like two in the morning.\u201d Gibbs, who is also the NCAA doubles champion, idolized Williams as a child, even serving as a ballgirl for her at age 12.  \u201cWhen I played Monica Seles for the first time it was pretty cool. To think someone would still want to be like me is kind of awesome,\u201d the 30-year-old Williams said. Gibbs won her opening match against Thailand\u2019s world No. 174 Noppawan Lertcheewakarn, who did not make it through qualifying at Wimbledon, but found a much tougher challenge in 14-time grand slam champion Williams.  \u201cIt was a great experience \u2013 it was really good to match up against that level and see what\u2019s out there,\u201d said Gibbs, who was appearing in the main draw of a WTA Tour event for the first time.  \u201cShe\u2019s such a hero in my mind and so built up in my mind, but I think I was definitely more in the match than I had anticipated being. After a few points I felt I could at least compete at that level.\u201d Williams was full of praise for her opponent too, adding, \u201cI think she played really well \u2013 she moves really well and she doesn\u2019t quit, and I think that\u2019s the best quality you can have as an athlete, and especially as a tennis player.  \u201cShe could have easily given up and she didn\u2019t. She\u2019s a fighter. And she has a really good first serve. I think she really held her own today.\u201d Williams will next face sixth seed Chanelle Scheepers after the South African beat Portuguese wildcard Michelle Larcher de Brito to reach her first top-level quarterfinal. \u201cSerena will definitely be a challenge, but I\u2019m ready to go out and just enjoy it,\u201d said Scheepers, who lost to Williams in straight sets in their only previous meeting.  \u201cI\u2019m happy with how the hard-court season has started and I hope to keep this up.\u201d"

        "content": "Soccer stars have plenty of spare time, and plenty of money, so this week\u2019s revelations of players gambling on events during English Premier League matches should come as no surprise. Claus Lundekvam\u2019s claims that \u201cspot-fix\u201d betting was rife when he was a player have attracted the attention of world governing body FIFA, which is also battling against the widespread problem of match-fixing. The Premier League has a well-documented gambling culture, with big names such as Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney owning race horses and featuring in big-stake \u201ccard schools\u201d on international and club duty. Before them, England internationals Tony Adams and Paul Merson had highly-publicized problems with gambling and alcohol. Former Southampton player Lundekvam is the latest to talk candidly about footballers\u2019 vices, revealing that he and other top-flight stars made money out of betting on minor events in games such as the first throw-in or corner kick. Swiss court: Former FIFA president took $1.5M in bribes \u201cFor a while we did this almost every week,\u201d Lundekvam told a Norwegian television channel. \u201cWe made a fair bit of money. We could make deals with the opposing captain. \u201cFor example, betting on the first throw, the first corner, who started with the ball, a yellow card or a penalty. Those were the sorts of thing we had influence over. \u201cThe results were never on the agenda. That is something I would never have done. We were professional competitors. Even though what we did, of course, was illegal, it was just a fun thing.\u201d Strict regulations and laws govern what professional footballers are able to gamble on, but are football\u2019s lawmakers taking the problem seriously enough? World governing body FIFA released a statement on Wednesday outlining its intention to look into Lundekvam\u2019s claims. \u201cFIFA is monitoring this issue and involved its chief investigator in England,\u201d FIFA told CNN. \u201cOnce all information is known it will be decided who is leading the investigations.\u201d The Premier League, which recently raised $4.5 billion selling broadcasting rights in Britain, declined to comment on the matter, while the English Football Association gave no indication it would be investigating Lundekvam\u2019s claims. \u201cThe FA has strict policies on this and our sanctions are wide-ranging. All participants also have a duty to report any such activity,\u201d it told CNN. \u201cFootball works closely with the gambling industry to monitor all markets and activity and we have a unit focused on maintaining the integrity of the sport.\u201d While the allegation of illegal activities within \u201cthe beautiful game\u201d is worrying, it also shines a light on another possible parasite eating away at soccer\u2019s top players. Lars Bohinen was an international teammate of Lundekvam\u2019s and enjoyed an eight-year Premier League career with Blackburn Rovers, Nottingham Forest and Derby County. The former midfielder said he was not aware of any spot-fixing when he played, but he does recall jokes being made about the subject during his time in England. \u201cOne of the examples Claus put forward was that you could bet on the first throw-in,\u201d said Bohinen, who retired in 2005. \u201cI remember we joked about that sometimes, but it was never seriously discussed. It was a rumor which went around at the time.  \u201cI suppose having learned about what\u2019s happened it would be naive to think it wasn\u2019t there, but I can\u2019t say to what extent it was there.\u201d Bohinen did acknowledge that players would bet thousands of pounds on the way to matches.  \u201cIt\u2019s not well known, but there have been cases,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople could lose \u00a33,000 or \u00a34,000 on a bus trip to London. Obviously that\u2019s not the best way to prepare for a game. \u201cAt one of my clubs they put an end to gambling on the bus on the way to away games. I think there are a lot more problems going on than people get to hear about.\u201d The Premier League\u2019s highly-paid players have become celebrities, which can make it even harder to admit to a gambling problem when your fans see you as a sporting hero. \u201cGambling addiction is not something players talk about \u2026 They would never come out and say that, but you could sense it from the way they gambled on cards, horses and football,\u201d Bohinen said. Many sportsmen suffering from addiction problems have turned to the Sporting Chance Clinic, a charity set up by former England captain Adams. \u201cThe issue may be getting to admit there is a problem in the first place,\u201d said a Sporting Chance spokesperson. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about footballers, there is a very clear, defined process in place.\u201d The Professional Footballers\u2019 Association (PFA) \u2013 the union which represents the concerns of players in England and Wales \u2013 refers cases of addiction to Sporting Chance, which offers residential care. \u201cIf you are a professional player at any level, if you are a member of the PFA, there is a huge support network in place which we are part of,\u201d said the Sporting Chance spokesperson. \u201cThere is a clear, full process in place which we are almost the culmination of. We get to see what you would almost consider the worst cases.\u201d However, PFA management committee chairman Clarke Carlisle suggested greater regulatory scrutiny raised privacy issues and also threatened to make the problem worse. \u201cWe\u2019ve not had a survey or a general questionnaire about the gambling habits of the players,\u201d said Carlisle, who was part of the Burnley team which played in the Premier League in the 2009-10 season. \u201cThe problem is that gambling calls into question the integrity of a match and of the sport. \u201cAs a union, we\u2019re never going to stop players gambling. If you were to put a blanket ban on it you would just drive it underground.

        "content": "A summer climbing expedition in the French Alps turned to tragedy early Thursday when a six-foot wall of snow came crashing down on two groups of climbers, leaving nine dead, French police said. Two people caught in the avalanche on the Mont Blanc massif were found alive in the snow afterward. Four others had been unaccounted for but later were found, police said. They had taken a different path on the mountain. Before the four were found, the search for them had been suspended just before 5 p.m. because of weather conditions, police said. Three people from Germany, three from Britain, two from Spain and one from Switzerland were killed, Haute-Savoie police said, but the nationalities of the missing are unknown. There were also French climbers in the party. Twelve people were injured, some of whom have already left the hospital because they had only minor injuries, police said. Police said a slab of snow and ice was thought to have triggered the avalanche but did not know what had dislodged it. Two groups of climbers were caught in the avalanche on the north side of Mont Maudit in the Mont Blanc range, near Chamonix on the French-Italian border, police said. A total of 28 climbers in the two groups were connected by ropes, said authorities in Annecy, France. Some of the climbers managed to get themselves back to their base at the Refuge des Cosmiques and raised the alarm. A mountain rescue unit was called out at 5:25 a.m. The route the climbers were taking up Mont Maudit is very popular with alpinists tackling the mighty Mont Blanc, said Alexis Hennebelle of Radio Mont Blanc. The climbers were very unlucky to be caught in such a catastrophic avalanche, he told CNN. Local newspaper Le Dauphine said it was the deadliest accident in the French Alps since 2003. French Interior Minister Manuel Valls visited Chamonix on Thursday afternoon to see the rescue efforts for himself. Speaking to reporters, he said the Mont Blanc range is, sadly, often the scene of dramas, but this is a particularly unfortunate incident. Valls paid tribute to the efforts of the emergency workers, French and Italian, who searched in perilous conditions of snow, ice and wind from the early morning for those who were missing. \u201cThey\u2019ve shown their professionalism, their sense of duty, to bring help in difficult conditions,\u201d he said. Valls said it was too soon to establish any responsibility for what had happened, and asked people to wait for the results of an investigation. Chamonix official Jean-Louis Verdier, who is responsible for mountain security, said there had been no clue Thursday morning that such a deadly avalanche might be unleashed. The climbers were on a steep slope where there was snow, which meant an avalanche was possible, but there was no reason to suspect it would happen then, he told CNN affiliate BFM TV. Bertrand Francois, of the Haute-Savoie police, told BFM the number of victims was a result of the high number of people in the area at this time of year. CNN meteorologist Mari Ramos said changes in temperature and heavy rainfall over the past week in the area may have created conditions in which sheets of ice like the one that fell are formed. According to the website pistehors.com, which recorded climbing deaths in the  French Alps between 2003 and 2008, the number of deaths seen Thursday is unusual in a single incident. For the 2007-2008 season, there were 12 recorded avalanche deaths for climbers, eight of them in one accident. However, in the other years, the annual total for climbing deaths by avalanche ranged between one and five, according to its figures. Mont Blanc is the highest mountain in Western Europe, at nearly 15,800 feet. Mont Maudit, about 1,000 feet lower and the third-highest peak in the range, seems to have lived up to its name, which can be translated as \u201chateful\u201d or \u201ccursed.\u201d 4 climbers feared dead after Mount McKinley avalanche Pakistani rescuers search for 139 trapped in avalanche After avalanche, Dutch prince suffers brain damage"

        "content": "Former FIFA president Joao Havelange and fellow Brazilian sports chief Ricardo Teixeira pocketed millions of dollars in bribes from a collapsed marketing company, documents released by a Swiss court Wednesday revealed. Havelange received at least 1.5 million Swiss francs ($1.53 million) while Teixeira, who was at one time his son-in-law, was paid at least CHF 12.4 million ($12.64 million).  The backhanders, made by International Sport and Leisure (ISL), were detailed in a judgment by Switzerland\u2019s supreme court, which was also published on the official FIFA website. ISL, a former official marketing partner for FIFA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC), was made bankrupt in 2001 with estimated debts of around $300 million, but the fallout from that collapse has reverberated around the world of sport. Havelange, who is now 96, stepped down as president of football\u2019s world governing body in 1998 after 24 years at the helm, but is still an honorary FIFA president. He resigned as a member of the IOC last December, citing ill health, just a few days before it was due to sanction him after a probe by its own ethics committee into payments by ISL to leading officials. IOC sanctions two leading sports officials over ISL link Teixeira was forced to quit his position on FIFA\u2019s executive committee and stand down as head of Brazil\u2019s 2014 World Cup organizing committee earlier this year when it became clear the report would be published. Both had tried to block its publication in the Swiss courts. FIFA said Wednesday it was \u201cpleased\u201d the documents had been made public and on its website highlighted the fact Havelange and Teixeira had been named while its current president, Sepp Blatter, was not. \u201cThe decision of the Swiss Federal Court also confirms that only two foreign officials will be named as part of the process and that, as previously communicated by the Prosecutor of Zug in June 2010, the FIFA President is not involved in the case (\u2018no Swiss person involved\u2019),\u201d read FIFA\u2019s statement.  The court documents reveal that Teixeira had paid CHF 2.5 million ($2.55 million) and Havelange CHF 500,000 ($510,000) in compensation. FIFA was accused by the court of having a \u201cdeficient organization\u201d and was being investigated for \u201cdisloyal management.\u201d It was also stated FIFA had paid CHF 2.5 million ($2.55 million) in compensation \u2013 but only agreed to the conditions if criminal actions against Havelange and Teixeira were dropped. Havelange played a key role in bringing the 2016 Olympics to Rio de Janeiro when the South American city was awarded the Games in 2009. He became an IOC member in 1963 and was FIFA president between 1974 and 1998 until Blatter, his longtime secretary general, took charge.   Havelange spent two months in hospital earlier this year with a heart problem and infected ankle, but he once famously invited IOC members to his 100th birthday party on Copacabana beach in 2016 should Rio get the Games.

        "content": "Prize money at this year\u2019s U.S. Open will be increased by over $2 million to a record $25.5 million, organizers announced Wednesday.  The increase will see a top prize of $1.9m for both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s champions, continuing the tradition of gender-equal prizes dating back 40 years. The remaining majority of the payout will be distributed throughout the main draw, with 224 out of 256   singles players guaranteed an increase in prize money of at least 18%. \u201cWe recognize the mounting financial pressures associated with competing on the global professional tennis circuits and especially for those who do not reach the second week of the U.S. Open.  \u201cWe believe the additional prize money, as well as how it will be strategically distributed, will help alleviate some of the pressure,\u201d said Jon Vegosen, U.S. Tennis Association (USTA) President and Chairman of the Board. These record-breaking figures will be supplemented by potential bonuses from the Emirates Airline U.S. Open Series Bonus Challenge.  The top three men\u2019s and top three women\u2019s finishers in the Emirates Airline U.S. Open Series will be awarded an additional bonus prize of up to $1m at the end of the grand slam, provided they earn points in at least two series events.  These bonuses have led to the two largest payouts in history, with Roger Federer taking $2.4m in 2007 and Kim Clijsters earning $2.2m in both 2005 and 2010.  This leaves the potential overall prize money on offer at $28.1 million. The cash boost comes on the heels of the announcement that the U.S. Open will benefit from a $500m development of the Flushing Meadows area.  A new Louis Armstrong Stadium, a new grandstand on unused land at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and a double-deck viewing area for fans to watch players practice will all be constructed over the next 10 years.  However, there are still no plans to put a roof on the main Arthur Ashe Stadium court. In other tennis news Wednesday, Lukas Rosol, who sent second seed Rafael Nadal crashing out of Wimbledon in one of the biggest upsets in the tournament\u2019s history, made an early exit from the ATP tournament in Stuttgart.

        "content": "Ratko Mladic, who is on trial on charges he masterminded an army campaign to cleanse Bosnia of Croats and Muslims, was taken to the hospital Thursday as a precautionary measure, a court spokeswoman said. \u201cProceedings were adjourned because he wasn\u2019t feeling well,\u201d said Nerma Jelacic, a spokeswoman for International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. She did not release any details about his condition. Mladic, whose trial began at the Hague in May, is accused of orchestrating a campaign of ethnic cleansing during the bloody civil war that ripped apart Yugoslavia. He has been indicted on 11 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in the 1992-95 war. Ratko Mladic: Brutal villain to many, hero to others His trial is taking place in The Hague at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, a court established to try those responsible for atrocities during the war. In May, prosecutor Dermot Groome laid out details of the case against Mladic, saying that ethnic cleansing was not a byproduct of the war, but a specific aim of the Bosnian Serb leadership. He said he would show that Mladic was directly responsible for atrocities carried out by his forces, which were fighting for control of land in ethnically mixed Bosnia. Mladic eluded authorities for nearly 16 years until his capture in May 2011, when police burst into the garden of a small house in northern Serbia. Analysis: In this battle with Mladic, women of Srebrencia hold the edge   Though he was carrying two handguns, he surrendered without a fight and was extradited to the Netherlands. In the three decades leading up to the violent splintering of Yugoslavia, Mladic rose rapidly through the ranks of the Yugoslav army. In 1991, he served as a front-line commander spearheading Serb forces in a yearlong war with Croatia. By the time he took to Bosnia\u2019s battlefields, he had become a hero to many Serbs, seen as a defender of their dwindling fortunes. In May 1992, Bosnia\u2019s Serbian political leaders picked him to lead the assault on their Muslim enemies who clamored for independence. Mladic wasted no time galvanizing his heavily armed forces in a siege of Sarajevo, cutting the city off from the outside world. Serb forces pounded the city every day from higher ground positions, trapping Sarajevo\u2019s ill-prepared residents in the valley below. As the war ended in the fall of 1995, Mladic went on the run. Shortly after Mladic was sent to The Hague last year, authorities nabbed former Croatian Serb rebel leader Goran Hadzic. He was the last Yugoslav war crimes suspect at large.

        "content": "An international effort to save a dog on death row in Northern Ireland ended in failure, heartbreak and recrimination Wednesday when Lennox \u2013 described by the Belfast City Council as a \u201cdangerous, illegal pit-bull terrier type\u201d \u2013 was put to death. The dog\u2019s owner, Caroline Barnes, told CNN she was devastated by the decision to kill an animal she described as a well-behaved family pet.  Lennox was taken from the Barnes family home in Belfast by dog wardens two years ago after city council officials identified him as a pit bull-type dog, which is illegal in Northern Ireland. The case provoked outrage from dog-lovers across the globe. Barnes\u2019 \u201cSave Lennox\u201d campaign went viral, attracting the support of celebrities, lawmakers and almost 200,000 people in an online petition. Vigils and protests were held by animal rights activists on both sides of the Atlantic, including demonstrations outside the British and Irish consulates in New York, to plead for Lennox\u2019s life. \u201cAnimal rights groups have even staged protests in New York about this. We did everything possible to save Lennox but they still wouldn\u2019t listen,\u201d said Barnes. However, the struggle \u2013 which involved several court hearings \u2013 ended when the council confirmed the 7-year-old dog had been \u201chumanely put to sleep.\u201d \u201cThis was in accordance with the Order of the County Court which was affirmed by the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal,\u201d said a  statement issued by the council Wednesday. The statement added that the council\u2019s expert \u201cdescribed the dog as one of the most unpredictable and dangerous dogs he had come across\u2026 The council regrets that the court action was necessary but would emphasize that the safety of the public remains its key priority.\u201d Northern Ireland\u2019s First Minister Peter Robinson turned to social media in a doomed, last-minute attempt at intervention. \u201cAs a dog lover I am very unhappy with the outcome of this case,\u201d he tweeted.  \u201cSpoke to Lord Mayor about Lennox. Suggested BCC (Belfast City Council) should seriously look at re-homing option. Why exercise the order if there\u2019s an alternative?\u201d The council was so determined to kill Lennox, Barnes said, that \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t even listen to the man responsible for running the country.\u201d Celebrity trainer Victoria Stilwell of Animal Planet\u2019s program \u201cIt\u2019s Me or the Dog\u201d traveled to Belfast to make her own personal appeal for clemency, describing Lennox as \u201can historically unaggressive American bulldog-labrador mix.\u201d \u201cVictoria was willing to take Lennox under her care in the United States at no expense to the council but they even turned that down as well,\u201d Barnes said. Lawyers for Barnes argued that the dog had never bitten anyone and had behaved well since being impounded, but in June, Northern Ireland\u2019s top court rejected a bid from Barnes to overturn the decision of two lower courts condemning Lennox to death. A 28-day deadline for legal appeals expired at midnight Tuesday. The dog was put to sleep at a secret location, the council said. Barnes said all legal options had been exhausted and the \u201cheartbroken\u201d family finally had to admit defeat. \u201cWe are devastated and disgusted by the way we have been treated by Belfast City Council.  They wouldn\u2019t even let us say goodbye to Lennox.\u201d In its statement Wednesday, the council claimed that some staff members had been threatened because of the Lennox case. \u201cOver the past two years, council officials have been subjected to a sustained campaign of abuse including threats of violence and death threats,\u201d said the statement. The council added it was \u201cin ongoing contact\u201d with Northern Ireland police regarding the alleged incidents. "

He said goodbye to me and hello to Willie Walsh.  Akbar attentively showed him every nook and cranny of the aircraft, crouching down to recline the new business class seat that Willie was in, showing him the new touch screen control panels and glossy fold away trays.  As we plugged in the microphone to ask Willie one question about what he thought of the plane, they headed to the front.

They were great sports for an impromptu interview. It felt like chatting to three guys who were old friends, having a laugh which was a rare informal side to see for men in their positions.

Protesters, including a group of miners who have marched on the capital, are demonstrating against Spain\u2019s government and the cuts it is imposing as it seeks to curb the country\u2019s debt crisis. Hundreds of people quickly moved out of the area as police moved in, with witnesses reporting the use of rubber bullets and batons by officers. Madrid\u2019s ambulance service said 76 people were injured in clashes at or near the Industry Ministry. Miners were among the 43 protesters who were injured, and 33 police also were hurt. Eight were receiving hospital treatment, but the injuries were not serious, the ambulance service said. A number of miners reached Madrid on Tuesday night after taking part in what has been dubbed the \u201cBlack March,\u201d covering 450 kilometers (280 miles) over the course of two and a half weeks. They were joined by thousands of other miners and supporters in a large protest Tuesday night and another demonstration Wednesday outside the Industry Ministry. The miners are protesting a 64% cut in the government subsidy to the mining sector this year \u2013 from 301 million euros to 111 million euros. Unions say this endangers the jobs of 8,000 miners and 22,000 auxiliary jobs that serve mining regions where 200,000 people live and depend on mines. The clashes came as Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced an increase in the country\u2019s general sales tax from 18% to 21%, as well as spending reductions that include cutting employment benefits after six months. Announcing the measures \u2013 which are bound to be unpopular with the public \u2013 to lawmakers, Rajoy said they would slash the budget by 65 billion euros ($80 billion) over two and a half years. Meeting budget deficit reduction targets will require austerity and more efficiency, he said, including cuts to government bureaucracy. \u201cWe will significantly reduce the number of public institutions,\u201d Rajoy vowed. The European Commission welcomed the move, saying it was an \u201cimportant step\u201d toward Spain meeting its deficit target for the year, Spain\u2019s Efe news agency said. Spain\u2019s economic crisis has worsened since last year. The nation slipped back into recession during the first quarter; the unemployment rate has risen to 24% overall, and more than 50% for those under age 25; and the government has already enacted billions of dollars in austerity cuts, along with some tax hikes, to reduce the budget deficit."

Iftikhar Ahmed said it was \u201cdevastating\u201d to be on trial for murdering his daughter Shafilea, CNN affiliate ITV reported. He was taking the stand for the first time in a case which has gripped Britain since the 17-year-old disappeared in September 2003. The court case took a startling turn Monday when Iftikhar\u2019s wife Farzana abruptly changed her long-standing story and said she had seen her husband attack their daughter on the night Shafilea died. Both parents are accused of the murder. One of Shafilea\u2019s sisters testified that she saw her parents push Shafilea onto a couch, stuff a bag into her mouth, and hold her down until she suffocated. Iftikhar and Farzana Ahmed have both pleaded not guilty at their trial in Chester, England. Newspapers, television and radio have all been reporting on the prosecution case that Shafilea\u2019s parents killed her because they felt her \u201cWestern\u201d lifestyle brought shame on the family. The teenager\u2019s dismembered body was found on a riverbank months after she disappeared. She had been stripped of anything that would identify her, prosecutor Andrew Edis told the jury in May, according to ITV. Shafilea\u2019s sister Alesha testified last month that she saw her parents kill the girl. Islam doesn\u2019t justify \u2018honor murders,\u2019 experts insist She said her parents were angry that Shafilea was wearing a short-sleeved, V-neck top, and no sweater, on the night she was killed. \u201cJust end it here,\u201d Farzana said to Iftikhar, according to their daughter. They pushed Shafilea down onto a sofa and suffocated her despite her struggles, Alesha testified.  Prosecutor Edis called it \u201can act of suffocation by both parents acting together.\u201d Alesha Ahmed did not tell police she had seen the killing until 2010, after she was detained by police in connection with a robbery of the family\u2019s home, ITV reported. She has pleaded guilty to robbery. Prosecutors said she had not been offered any sort of deal in exchange for testifying against her parents. She has testified that both her parents physically abused Shafilea \u201cevery day\u201d over the course of five years, and that her mother did it more \u201cbecause she was at home more.\u201d On Monday, Farzana unexpectedly said she had seen her husband attack Shafilea. She said that she tried to intervene to protect the girl, but that her husband pushed her away and punched her, ITV reported. Indian police: Man chops off daughter\u2019s head, citing her \u2018indecent behavior\u2019 \u201cExtremely scared,\u201d she fled the room and stayed in a bedroom with other children until she heard a car leaving 20 minutes later. When her husband returned alone, she asked where their daughter was. \u201cIf you care for your dear life and that of your children, don\u2019t ever ask me this question again,\u201d he told her, ITV reported. Farzana Ahmed testified Monday that only one of their children, Mevish, was present when she saw her husband attacking Shafilea. The jury was told that Shafilea had been taken to Pakistan for a hastily arranged marriage before her death, and drank bleach when her parents suggested she was staying there when the rest of the family returned to England, ITV reported. She was hospitalized for three months after the family came home because of the bleach incident, Alesha testified. Alesha testified in May that her parents were very strict with their daughters, ITV reported. Family convicted in Canada \u2018honor murders\u2019 \u201cOur family was very restricted. It was very different. The Pakistani culture is more restrictive in terms of what you can wear or do,\u201d she said. The trial began in May and is expected to last several more weeks, prosecutors say. Reliable figures of the number of honor murders around the world are hard to come by, but the United Nations Population Fund has estimated there could be 5,000 per year. So-called honor murders are a significant enough problem in Britain that the country\u2019s Crown Prosecution Service has an expert specializing in cases in which members of a family kill relatives because of behavior that they say shames the family. The CPS began keeping statistics on honor violence in April 2010 and prosecuted 234 cases in the following year, just over half of which were successful. There is a perception that the crime is particularly common among Muslims, but one vocal British campaigner says not all honor violence is perpetrated by Muslims. Disappearance, then discovery, leads to \u2018honor killing\u2019 outrage Jasvinder Sanghera, who was the victim of a forced marriage, is not Muslim; she is Sikh. \u201cSignificant cases are happening within South Asian communities, be it Pakistani, Indian, Sikh, Muslim, Kurdish, Iranian, Middle Eastern communities,\u201d she said. The killings take place in many parts of the world, experts say. Indian father accused of killing baby \u2018for being a girl\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a problem that happens in many different places: the Middle East, Pakistan, Bangladesh and among immigrant communities in North America,\u201d said Nadya Khalife, a researcher on women\u2019s rights in the Arab world for Human Rights Watch. Several Arab countries and territories, including Iraq, Kuwait, Syria, Yemen and the Palestinian territories, have laws providing lesser sentences for honor murders than for other murders, Human Rights Watch says. Egypt and Jordan also have laws that have been interpreted to allow reduced sentences for honor crimes, the group says."

Spain has been badly affected by the Eurozone crisis, and the golf tournament\u2019s main sponsor Spanish bank Bankia was recently bailed out to the tune of $23 billion in May. Madrid was keen to host the event, which was scheduled to be held from September 20-23, but needs nearly $1 million of sponsorship to do so. \u201cWe have known of the troubles facing the Spanish leg of the tour for some time now, but had held out hope of receiving funding,\u201d chief operating officer of the European Tour Keith Waters told CNN.   \u201cIt eventually just proved too challenging. The only people who face losing any money are the players \u2013 there\u2019s one less prize for them to win now. All of the money invested in the tournament was yet to be paid.\u201d Waters said was unlikely that the Madrid event would return to the European calendar next year. \u201cPlanning for next season\u2019s tour is already at advanced stages, with the schedule to be announced in the coming weeks. You never know, a generous backer could emerge, but it is unlikely,\u201d he said. Despite the pan-European economic turmoil, all other dates on the European Tour are currently set to go ahead as planned."

        "content": "The son of one of the world\u2019s wealthiest men is under arrest in London after the body of his American-born wife was found in their home this week, her death unexplained. Police stumbled into the mystery Monday, when they arrested Hans Kristian Rausing on drug charges. A search of his home in one of London\u2019s most expensive neighborhoods turned up the body of his wife, Eva, spurring police to arrest him again in connection with the death. Eva Rausing had struggled with drug addiction for years, an acquaintance said. \u201cThis has been an existing problem for a long time,\u201d said Liz Brewer, who knew Rausing through charity and social circles. \u201cI think the whole thing is a complete tragedy.\u201d The case puts the multimillionaire couple squarely back in the headlines four years after they were arrested on charges of possessing cocaine and heroin, according to media reports at the time.  Eva Rausing had tried to smuggle a small amount of crack cocaine and heroin into the U.S. Embassy in London, reports said. She and her husband were arrested when police found more drugs at their house. The pair, however, avoided prosecution. Since then, they have kept a low profile, Forbes magazine said in its annual rich list report this year. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear to us Eva had her own problems with drugs and drugs misuse,\u201d the head of an anti-drug organization told CNN Wednesday. \u201cShe knew prevention was important.  She knew how hard it was to get off drugs once you are on drugs,\u201d said Paul Tuohy, chief executive of Mentor.  Eva Rausing had donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the charity in the years before her death, Mentor said. Her husband is the son of Hans Rausing, who is worth an estimated $10 billion, thanks to the family\u2019s connection to Swedish packaging giant Tetra Laval. Hans Kristian Rausing is now receiving medical treatment, police said Wednesday.   An autopsy Tuesday failed to determine the cause of Eva Rausing\u2019s death, police said. Police refused to name Rausing as the man who was arrested, but a source familiar with the investigation said the man in custody lived at the address where the body was found. The source asked not to be named discussing an ongoing investigation. Eva Rausing gave more than 500,000 pounds ($778,000) to Mentor, said the charity, which runs programs \u201cto protect children from alcohol and drugs.\u201d J&J heiress, found dead, had high-profile life Posts on a MySpace page dating back to 2007 that appears to belong to Rausing, but whose authenticity could not be verified, give a picture of her ups and downs. She writes that she went to college in California. \u201cI had a good time there \u2013 too good, as I dropped out and did not go back to university until the grand old age of 24. Which leaves some troubled years in between \u2026  The beginning was fun, the ending not so fun,\u201d she writes. \u201cI was lucky to have a loving supportive family who stood by me, though I didn\u2019t always see it that way at the time. So, I cleaned up my act, became a good girl, if maybe a little boring, got a degree in economics, and then got married!\u201d She says she is a good mother to the couple\u2019s four children but, in an apparent reference to her drug abuse issues, she writes of relapsing several years earlier. \u201cI fell back into the same hole as before and have been there for nearly 7 years. I once read that I would have 7 bad years (I don\u2019t normally believe in hocus pocus horoscopes) but so far it has been right, and I\u2019m hoping for 7 good years starting 2007. \u201cI\u2019m still married, amazingly, to a very kind, patient and loyal husband. I\u2019m very lucky that he has stuck with me \u2013 many would have not.\u201d Hans Kristian Rausing\u2019s billionaire father was bought out of the Tetra Laval business founded by his own father.  Tetra Pak declined to comment on Eva Rausing\u2019s death or her husband\u2019s arrest because their branch of the family \u201cdivested its interests in Tetra Pak, and the Tetra Laval Group, in 1995.\u201d"

        "content": "Ecuador is weighing the asylum request of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and will make the decision on its own, in its own time, the country\u2019s president said Tuesday. Assange has been living inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since applying for political asylum on June 19. He is seeking to avoid being sent to Sweden over claims of rape and sexual molestation and said he fears if he is extradited there, Swedish authorities could hand him over to the United States. \u201cEcuador will make its own, independent decision,\u201d said President Rafael Correa, the state-run El Ciudadano website reported, citing an interview he gave to a local TV station. \u201cThe case is under review.\u201d Correa noted that capital punishment exists in the United States for a \u201cpolitical crime,\u201d and that fact could be sufficient grounds to grant Assange asylum, El Ciudadano said.  The state-run website also said Correa stressed he is not afraid of international repercussions that might stem from whatever decision Ecuador makes. \u201cWe have to see whether everything that\u2019s being done in the case of Julian Assange is compatible with \u2026 the constitution and our view of human rights, political rights and due process,\u201d the president said. Assange was arrested in Britain in 2010 because Swedish authorities wanted to question him about the sexual molestation and rape allegations, which he denies. His bail conditions included staying every night at the home of a supporter outside London. UK police say Assange is in violation of his bail by staying at the embassy. After he entered it, they served him with notice to turn himself in \u2013 an order he ignored, marking a further violation. Diplomatic protocol prevents police from entering the embassy to arrest him. Two women have accused Assange of sexually assaulting them in August 2010, when he was visiting Sweden in connection with a WikiLeaks release of internal U.S. military documents. He was arrested in Britain that December and has been fighting extradition since, saying the allegations are retribution for his organization\u2019s disclosure of American secrets. Susan Benn of the Julian Assange defense fund has said the United States had empaneled a grand jury in its goal to press charges against Assange. Turning himself in to British authorities would start a process that would end with Assange being extradited to the United States, she said.  WikiLeaks, which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information, has published about 250,000 confidential U.S. diplomatic cables, causing embarrassment to the government and others. It also has published hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. documents relating to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Assange sought refuge at the embassy five days after the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom dismissed a bid to reopen his appeal of the decision to send him to Sweden, his last option in British courts. British officials have met with Ecuadorian authorities, but no information has been released about those meetings."

The 25-year-old will be competing in her first Olympics at London 2012, where she will play in the women\u2019s singles tournament. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware that I am the first woman but what a personal honor to be representing Russia,\u201d she told CNN.  \u201cI am grateful for the sincere support from my family, friends and fans from home and across the globe. I\u2019m truly proud and humbled to represent a country that is full of hopes and dreams.\u201d Sharapova has battled her way back to the top of women\u2019s tennis after two years of shoulder problems, returning to No. 1 in the world rankings after completing a career grand slam by winning last month\u2019s French Open. She lost top spot to Victoria Azarenka of Belarus this week after a surprise defeat in the fourth round at Wimbledon dropped her to No. 3, but has the chance to make amends as the Olympic event will also be held at the famous grass-court venue. \u201cThis year\u2019s upcoming Olympics in London holds special meaning to me as this will be my first foray into the Games,\u201d Sharapova said.  \u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable opportunity to not only compete in such a historically prestigious sporting moment, but I am looking forward to sharing this Olympic experience with fellow athletes around the world.\u201d Sharapova, who will reportedly marry basketball star Sasha Vujacic in November after the end of the tennis season, has been based in the United States for most of her life. She has played three times for Russia\u2019s Fed Cup team, all in quarterfinal ties, winning three of her four singles rubbers. Sharapova did not qualify for the 2004 Olympics in Beijing, despite winning her first grand slam title at Wimbledon as a 17-year-old. She missed out in Beijing in 2008 due to injury, and compatriot Elena Dementieva \u2013 who has since retired \u2013 won the women\u2019s gold. Russia first took part at the Summer Olympics in 1912, but did not appear again until 1952 as the Soviet Union. Since then the honor of carrying the flag has usually gone to male gold medal-winners. This year, Serbia and Spain will also have a tennis star as flag-bearer as men\u2019s world No. 2 Novak Djokovic and Beijing champion Rafael Nadal have been given the role by their respective countries.

        "content": "The Russian Football Union has drawn up an ambitious wish list of some of the sport\u2019s biggest names to replace departed coach Dick Advocaat. Top of the bill is undoubtedly ex-Barcelona coach Josep Guardiola, who quit the former European and Spanish champions at the end of last season in order to take a break from the game. Former England coach Fabio Capello is also on the 13-man list, posted on the RFU website on Tuesday, along with his fellow Italian Marcello Lippi \u2013 a World Cup winner in 2006, and now with Chinese team Guangzhou Evergrande. Former Argentina and Chile coach Marcelo Bielsa is also being considered, despite insisting that he wants to stay at Athletic Bilbao in the wake of an argument with the Spanish club\u2019s board. The RFU is also targeting two men with less international-level experience but a good club pedigree: Rafael Benitez and Harry Redknapp. Former Liverpool and Valencia boss Benitez has not held a coaching position since being sacked by Inter Milan in December 2010, while Redknapp is a more recent addition to the unemployed ranks after being sacked by English club Tottenham in June. Redknapp had been widely favored to replace Capello as England coach, but the 65-year-old missed out as Roy Hodgson was instead appointed ahead of Euro 2012. Valery Nepomnyashchy, who took Cameroon to the quarterfinals of the 1990 World Cup, is one of seven Russians on the list. Former U.S.S.R. international Valery Gazzaev coached the national side from 2002-03, while Anatoliy Byshovets was in charge in 1998 and led the Soviet team to Olympic gold a decade before that. Dynamo Kiev\u2019s Yury Syomin had a brief spell as Russia boss in 2005. Of the others, former Dynamo Moscow manager Andrei Kobelev and Yuri Krasnozhan (ex-Anzhi Makhachkala) have had no top-level international experience, while Nikolai Pisarev coaches the Russia Under-21 team. Russia\u2019s last two coaches have been Dutchmen, with Advocaat following Guus Hiddink. Hiddink took Russia to the semifinals of Euro 2008, but then failed to qualify for the 2010 World Cup as the team surprisingly lost to unfancied Slovenia in a playoff. He is now coach at Anzhi. Advocaat helped Zenit St. Petersburg become only the second Russian club to win a European title in the second-tier UEFA Cup in 2008, and was named Russia coach after a short spell in charge of both Belgium\u2019s national side and Dutch team AZ Alkmaar. He announced before Euro 2012 that he would stand down after the tournament to return to his homeland with PSV Eindhoven, and Russia crashed out in the group stage after failing to follow up the impressive opening 4-1 win over the Czech Republic.

        "content": "It\u2019s hard to believe that this area of east London was once a dilapidated and neglected quarter of the UK capital.  With shiny new stadiums and visitor facilities nestling among the lush landscaped grounds, every detail of the 500-acre Olympic Park has taken into account environmental concerns, prompting 2012 organizers to bill it as the first sustainable Olympics.  David Stubbs, head of sustainability for the London 2012 Games, was part of the original team that drafted London\u2019s successful bid.  Sustainability was a key reason why London was chosen, he says, and provides a golden opportunity to show what can be achieved.  \u201cIf you can put sustainability at the heart of a project which is the largest logistical exercise in peace time \u2013 across 26 different sports, with thousands of people attending and millions watching \u2013 then you can do it anywhere,\u201d Stubbs said.  See more: CNN\u2019s Aiming for Gold Many of the park\u2019s bridges have been constructed using gabion walls (steel mesh filled with stones and rubble) providing a visual reminder of the Games\u2019 green goals. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge emphasis on reuse and recycling,\u201d says Stubbs.  \u201cAll the buildings that were knocked down, all that rubble was sort of crushed up and used as the fillings of these gabions for the new bridges.\u201d The River Lea and several canals which wend their way through the park used to be badly polluted, he says. Today, after an intensive program of clearing and widening, wildlife is being encouraged to return.  Watch: London\u2019s new \u201cGreen Park\u201d \u201cCreating a shallower profile in the wetlands further up (the river) has allowed larger areas of wildlife habitat to be created. At the same time that\u2019s providing flood mitigation benefits to thousands of properties in the local area,\u201d Stubbs says. In addition to over 300,000 wetland plants, organizers have planted more than 4,000 trees and 130,000 plants and bulbs.     \u201cOne of the key things about this site is how you\u2019ve got natural park lands as well as more formal gardens. Unlike previous games people are going to really feel they are in a park,\u201d Stubbs said.  London 2012 organizers are also proud of the park\u2019s sporting arenas built for the Games. Behind the velodrome\u2019s timber-clad frame, cyclists will race for gold round a track made from sustainably-sourced Siberian pine, while Zaha Hadid\u2019s striking wave-shaped roof on the Aquatics Center has been temporarily adorned with \u201cwings\u201d providing seating for 15,000 spectators.  \u201cThat\u2019s great for the games, but after we\u2019ll bring it down to 2,500 seats for legacy mode, as it turns into a facility for the local community,\u201d he said. Temporary seating and venues, like the 12,000-seat Basketball Arena, will accommodate nearly 300,000 spectators during the games \u2013 a figure without precedent at any previous Olympics, according to organizers.   All eyes will be on the Olympic Stadium come the opening ceremony on July 27 with the 80,000-seat arena being the sustainable centerpiece of the Games.  Constructed using just a tenth of the steel required to build Beijing\u2019s \u201cBird\u2019s Nest\u201d, the stadium weighs in at just 4,500 tons, becoming the lightest Olympic Stadium ever built. Parts of the tubular steel roof has been built using surplus gas pipelines, Stubbs says.  He and his team have used recycled materials wherever possible, which is not only cheaper but also cuts carbon emissions and energy costs. The complexities of the addressing sustainability have been a constant challenge Stubbs says, but his efforts appear to have paid off. London 2012 \u201ccan build the confidence to wider society that sustainability is not a theory but infinitely do-able,\u201d said executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, Achim Steiner during a visit in April this year.  \u201cThrilled\u201d at the results he and his team have managed to produce, Stubbs is hopeful the park will be attracting visitors long after the Olympics has left town.  \u201cIt\u2019s not about two weeks \u2026 It is what this site will be like 20 to 30 years down the road,\u201d Stubbs said.

        "content": "After seven years of planning and construction costing over $150 million, Donald Trump\u2019s dream to open a golf course in Scotland was finally realized on Tuesday. The U.S.-based billionaire hit the ceremonial first tee shot at Trump International Golf Links, having weathered a storm of controversy involving environmentalists, local residents and politicians. \u201cIt\u2019s been worth it,\u201d he told CNN during his rain and wind-swept round at the venue.  \u201cThis is truly the greatest golf course anywhere in the world. Everybody knows it. Most people are saying it and most of the golf people are saying it, most importantly.\u201d Trump welcomed guests from the European Tour and the Ryder Cup organizing committee, and told them: \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing like it.\u201d Set on the east coast of Scotland, eight miles north of the city of Aberdeen, the course occupies part of the private Menie Estate, bought by Trump in 2006.  The opening of the championship course is the first step towards the American tycoon\u2019s goal of creating a resort featuring a second golf course, a hotel, luxury holiday homes and a residential village. Trump expects the total bill for the development to exceed a billion dollars, although the next stage of building is currently on hold while he contests plans to build an offshore wind farm nearby. Rarely has a new golf course had such criticism and hype. Accusations of bullying from local residents and objections from environmental groups were documented in the movie \u201cYou\u2019ve Been Trumped,\u201d while sport writers have been thrilled at every new photo revealing the dramatic holes. The sheer amount of money pumped into the project enabled English golf architect Martin Hawtree to manipulate the land on an unprecedented scale. \u201cThis is one of the most extraordinary golf links sites you have seen or will ever see,\u201d Hawtree said at the opening ceremony. \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind it will be in the top three in the world. I just don\u2019t know who\u2019ll be number two or three!\u201d Before the opening, Golf World magazine announced that the course has gone straight into its UK course rankings at number eight, ahead of several British Open venues including Royal Lytham & St. Annes, which will host the golf season\u2019s third major tournament next week. Trump\u2019s ultimate goal is to bring a major tournament to his latest course, and the European Tour chief executive George O\u2019Grady hinted that it may not be far away. \u201cGreat courses need great tournaments,\u201d said O\u2019Grady, \u201cWe will work with Mr. Trump to bring the right event here.\u201d Sandy Jones of the Great Britain and Ireland Professional Golfers\u2019 Association made the only reference to the saga of controversy and criticism around the course\u2019s planning:  \u201cGolf is a responsible business. It embraces the environment. I wish the environmentalists would embrace golf,\u201d he said. On the course, Trump was joined by one of the European Tour\u2019s most successful players, Colin Montgomerie, who described the course as \u201cdramatic and spectacular.\u201d On the question of whether Trump International will ever host the British Open or a Ryder Cup event, the Scottish golfer was optimistic. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that tournament golf will come here,\u201d the 49-year-old former European Ryder Cup captain said.  \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic opportunity for people locally, nationally and internationally to come to this area.\u201d Trump championed his Scottish family ties throughout the planning process, and continued the theme at the opening ceremony as he gave out whiskey and shortbread to invited guests. The tale of how an American billionaire\u2019s dream became reality across the pond has made Trump International Golf Links one of the hottest tickets of the summer, with tee times already in short supply. The course opens to the public on Sunday, with green fees costing $310 on a weekend or $233 on a weekday, the same price as the summer rate on the prestigious Old Course at St. Andrews, known as \u201cthe home of golf.\u201d"

The 1986 World Cup winner arrived in Dubai on a lucrative contract in May 2011, but could only manage to take Al-Wasl to eighth place in the 12-team UAE Pro-League \u2013 which  resulted in the club\u2019s board resigning.

Al-Wasl has won the UAE league title seven times, but not since 2007. Under Maradona, the club won just seven of 22 league games and lost in the quarterfinals of the UAE President\u2019s Cup and the final of the Gulf Clubs Champions League. In March, Maradona angrily confronted fans who abused his wife and friends during a match, and Al-Wasl issued an apology which condemned the supporters\u2019 actions. Maradona is one of the greatest players in soccer history, having starred for Barcelona and Napoli, but his career was marred by controversy over drug use and he suffered from subsequent health problems."

The Australian won his second race of the season at Sunday\u2019s rain-soaked British Grand Prix, closing the gap in the drivers\u2019 championship between himself and first-placed Fernando Alonso to 13 points. \u201cI\u2019ve been with Red Bull Racing since 2007 and have achieved nine grand prix wins during that time,\u201d Webber told the team\u2019s official website.  \u201cI\u2019m high on confidence at the moment and firing on all cylinders.

The relationship between the two Red Bull drivers has often been perceived as less than amicable, with tempers flaring when they crashed into each other during the Turkish Grand Prix in 2010. But Webber was quick to dispel any notion of hostilities. On his partnership with the German, Webber said: \u201cObviously with Seb, we\u2019ve worked very, very close together for a long period of time now. I think no-one would really have envisaged how long we have worked together, so that\u2019s probably been a bit of a surprise.  \u201cThere are not many teammates staying together for that long in Formula One, but it\u2019s proved to be a successful partnership with both of us working very hard with the key technical members of the team.  \u201cIt\u2019s been a potent operation. We\u2019re still competitive when we hit the track. Last year there wasn\u2019t much racing between Sebastian and I, but in 2009, 2010 and this year, there have been some great battles.\u201d When asked about his future beyond the 2013 season, Webber remained enigmatic.  \u201cIt\u2019s a results-based sport at the front of the grid so the future lies in my own hands,\u201d said the 35-year-old. \u201cIt\u2019s down to me to deliver the on-track results.\u201d"

        "content": "Roberto Mancini has signed a new five-year contract with Manchester City after guiding the club to their first English title for 44 years. The Italian oversaw a gripping finale to the Premier League season when two injury time goals in City\u2019s last match of the campaign saw them pip rivals Manchester United to the championship. The former Inter Milan manager has now committed his future to the club until 2017. \u201cI am delighted to be able to give all of my efforts to Manchester City for a further five years,\u201d Mancini told the club\u2019s official website. Manchester City win Premier League title in thrilling finale \u201cThe opportunity which exists to build on our recent success is enormous. Manchester City is a fantastic football club, from the owner, chairman, board and the executive team, through to the players, staff and fans. \u201cI am very much looking forward to the challenges and excitement ahead.\u201d Mancini was appointed in December 2009 after the club sacked Mark Hughes, and has been afforded millions to spend in the transfer market by the club\u2019s oil-rich owners. Players like Yaya Toure, David Silva, Mario Balotelli and Sergio Aguero have all arrived for multi-million dollar fees and helped the club to their first major trophy in 2011, when they won the English FA Cup. It was a goal from Argentina striker Aguero that confirmed their dramatic Premier League victory in the final game of last season against Queens Park Rangers, now managed by Hughes. It marked a shift in power in the Premier League as Mancini and his team finally toppled Manchester United, who have a record 20 English titles to their name. City\u2019s interim chief executive officer, John MacBeath, said of the deal: \u201cRoberto\u2019s managerial credentials have been well proven in Europe for many years. \u201cIn leading a team which has won the FA Cup and an unforgettable Premier League title in successive seasons, his ability to manage in the English domestic game is also undisputed.  \u201cThis new agreement allows Roberto to focus on the challenge of guiding a team which is capable not only of defending the Premier League title, but one which can compete for European honors.\u201d City begin the defense of their Premier League title with a home game against newly-promoted Southampton on August 19."

        "content": "Despite a thrilling victory at the British Grand Prix that saw Mark Webber close the gap on world championship leader Fernando Alonso, Red Bull insist they are in no rush to offer him a new contract. The Australian chalked up his second victory of the season at Silverstone, hunting down the Ferrari of Alonso at the climax of a hugely tactical race. Webber closed the gap between himself and his Spanish rival to 16 points with the halfway point in the campaign fast approaching. Though the 35-year-old is emerging as a leading contender to claim his maiden Formula One title and despite speculation linking him with a switch to Ferrari, Red Bull insist they are relaxed about his contract. Webber pips Alonso to take British GP at Silverstone \u201cI think that very simply we have a great relationship with Mark,\u201d team boss Christian Horner told gathered reporters. \u201cAs always with him, things are pretty straightforward. \u201cThis is his seventh season with the team. He has had all of his success in  F1 with this team and we would like to see that continue. \u201cInevitably there is an awful lot of speculation surrounding Ferrari, but  we are only focused on ourselves. We cannot control what other people say or do, and I think that Mark feels comfortable in the team.\u201d The marque also boast defending double world champion Sebastian Vettel amongst their ranks, and Webber has been outspoken in the past about having to play second fiddle to the German. But Horner confirmed that contract talks with Webber are on the agenda in the not too distant future and praised Vettel for claiming a podium place at Silverstone. \u201cMark wants to be in the team next year and therefore, as we have always stated, during the summer we will sit down and talk about the future,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that period of time is obviously coming up pretty close now, so over  the next few weeks we will be talking about 2013. Mark has given me every indication that he is very happy here, and you can see that in his driving. \u201cHe is driving very well this year, he has won two big races now \u2013 the Monaco Grand Prix and the British Grand Prix, and I think his drive at  Silverstone was excellent. Latest Formula One standings \u201cIt was great for him to win for the team at our local race, and obviously coming from just up the road as well, and to have Sebastian up there on the podium after a difficult first lap again was a double bonus.\u201d Meanwhile, Ferrari team boss Stefano Domenicali thinks the constructors\u2019 title will be as closely fought as the drivers\u2019 championship this year. Red Bull have dominated in each of the last two years and though they are out in front again this season, the gap to Ferrari is only 64 points. Domenicali said: \u201cIf we look at the situation of Silverstone, with the first four cars, it  means we have made a step in the right direction from the performance point of  view. But it is a very open championship,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe honestly that the others will stay behind. I am sure McLaren will fight to come back, and the others are very close. \u201cI was impressed by the pace of Lotus. If you look at (Romain) Grosjean, if  you look at the first lap he pitted and then he finished sixth. So the field is very tight.\u201d "

        "content": "John Terry, one of England\u2019s biggest soccer stars, testified as his trial entered its second day Tuesday that he was upset and angry when he thought he had been accused of racial abuse by another player. The normally staid chambers of Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court got an earful of shockingly foul language Monday, as the court heard what the Chelsea captain allegedly said to Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand. Early in the session Tuesday, jurors heard an interview the Football Association conducted with Terry after the October 23 match. Terry said he was upset because he thought Ferdinand had accused him of racism. \u201cI was really angry and cross about him calling me a racist,\u201d he said in the interview. Terry made that point again as he was questioned before the court Tuesday. \u201cWhen he\u2019s accused me of that, I couldn\u2019t control my emotions,\u201d Terry said. The prosecution suggested Terry couldn\u2019t keep his temper because Ferdinand had taunted him over his alleged affair with a teammate\u2019s girlfriend. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t, could you? You\u2019re not a racist but you used racist language. You snapped, didn\u2019t you?\u201d the prosecutor asked. But Terry rejected the argument, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s two years on, I\u2019ve heard that a 100 times, a million times. If I was going to snap I would have snapped long before.\u201d The Chelsea captain told the court he was repeating what he mistakenly thought Ferdinand had accused him of saying as they traded insults in a heated game. In the interview with the Football Association, Terry said he spoke with Ferdinand after the match to ask him if the defender had accused him of making a racist comment. \u201cI said to \u202aAnton\u202c, \u2018was you accusing me of calling you a black c\u2014?\u2019 and he said \u2018No, not at all.\u2019\u201d  In the interview Terry said: \u201cIf I had something to hide I would have whispered it into someone\u2019s ear.\u201d Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle earlier rejected a request by Terry\u2019s legal team to dismiss the case due to \u201cinsufficient evidence.\u201d  A lip reader watching a video of the incident on Monday told the court what Terry said, including two extremely obscene words. Terry does not deny directing a barrage of foul language at Ferdinand and referring to him as \u201cblack,\u201d but he denies engaging in racist abuse. The highly unusual criminal prosecution over words uttered on a soccer field comes as English soccer officials fight to stamp racism out of the sport, with mixed results. Liverpool player Luis Suarez was banned for eight matches when the Football Association, the English sport\u2019s governing body, found he had racially abused Manchester United defender Patrice Evra. The chanting of racist abuse by fans also remains a sporadic problem in soccer across Europe. The Crown Prosecution Service is pressing charges against Terry for a \u201cracially aggravated public order offense\u201d because of the comments during the match between Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers. Prosecutors played a video of the incident, without sound, as the case opened Monday morning. The alleged abuse came after Ferdinand knocked Terry down during the game, the jury heard. When he got up, Terry made a gesture as if Ferdinand\u2019s breath smelled, and he called Ferdinand a \u201cc\u2014,\u201d prosecutor Duncan Penny told the court. Ferdinand responded with the same word, saying it described Terry, not him, because Terry had had sex with a teammate\u2019s partner, the prosecutor said. Ferdinand also made an obscene gesture related to sex as Terry ran back into position, Penny said. Ferdinand testified that he did not hear the comments Terry made at him, but that he would have been \u201churt and disappointed\u201d if he had heard Terry call him a \u201cblack c\u2014\u201d \u201cWhen someone brings your color into it, it takes it to another level and it\u2019s very hurtful,\u201d Ferdinand said. Terry maintains that Ferdinand knocked him down before the incident and that the two then exchanged \u201cnormal football verbals.\u201d He told Football Association officials that he then repeated to Ferdinand words he thought the opposing player had said to him, Penny told the court Monday. The maximum penalty for the offense is \u00a32,500 (about $3,900).  That would be a drop in the bucket for a player worth millions, but a criminal conviction could lead to action against him by his team or England\u2019s Football Association. Terry was captain of England\u2019s national team at the time of the incident but was stripped of his captaincy after a preliminary court hearing on the racism charge in February. He remained captain of Chelsea, which went on to win the prestigious European Champions League this year. The trial could last up to five days, court officials say. "

        "content": "The first witness in the trial of Ratko Mladic, the former commander of the Bosnian Serb army, testified Monday that the army slaughtered Bosnian Muslims from his village in 1992. Elvedin Pasic said that he was 13 when his family, anticipating the arrival of the army, decided to split up. Though the family members had signed a truce with their Serbian neighbors, they feared that the village\u2019s men and boys would be killed anyway, he said. So, Pasic and his father fled with about 200 other villagers, including the village imam, he said. But a combined force of Bosnian Serb army soldiers and Serbian civilians ambushed them, he said. \u201cIt was around midnight,\u201d he said. \u201cSuddenly we stopped. And everyone said, \u2018Hush-hush. We are very close to the Serbs. Don\u2019t move, don\u2019t make any sounds.\u2019 That\u2019s when the bullets started firing.\u201d Fleeing the gunfire, the group ran straight into a minefield, where one of the men\u2019s legs was blown off, Pasic said. \u201cHe was crying and saying, \u2018Do something, kill me.\u2019 My dad grabbed me and said, \u2018Don\u2019t look.\u2019 \u201d   After the villagers surrendered, a Bosnian Serb soldier separated the youngest children and a handful of women from the men, said Pasic, who was with his father at the time. \u201cThey ordered all the women and children to get up; I didn\u2019t want to get up. I said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to get up.\u2019  I didn\u2019t want to leave him. \u2018Get up,\u2019 he whispered to me.  My uncle said, \u2018Get up; you will survive.\u2019 \u201c He said his father denied to the Serbs that any of his relatives were among the group in order to save him.  The women and children from the group were then led through a gantlet of Serbian civilians who beat them with sticks, after which the prisoners were put on a bus and taken to the village Grabovica, Pasic said. During Pasic\u2019s testimony, Mladic wiped his eyes. Mladic is accused of masterminding the army campaign to \u201ccleanse\u201d Bosnia of Croats and Bosnian Muslims. Those atrocities included the Srebrenica massacre in which 8,000 people were executed and the siege of Sarajevo, which lasted more than three years and killed 10,000. Pasic is the first of hundreds of witnesses expected to testify against Mladic, who is 70.  Pasic, now 34, said he was reunited with his mother but he never saw his father again. At the end of his testimony, he said that of the more than 100 men he left behind, \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind, they were all killed.\u201d Mladic\u2019s trial began in May, but was suspended after a single day over the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose evidence against Mladic. Mladic is accused of orchestrating a campaign of ethnic cleansing during the bloody civil war that ripped apart Yugoslavia. He has been indicted on 11 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in the 1992-95 war. His trial is taking place in The Hague at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, a court established to try those responsible for atrocities during the war. In May, prosecutor Dermot Groome laid out details of the case against Mladic, saying that ethnic cleansing was not a byproduct of the war, but a specific aim of the Bosnian Serb leadership. He said he would show that Mladic was directly responsible for atrocities carried out by his forces, which were fighting for control of land in ethnically mixed Bosnia. Mladic eluded authorities for nearly 16 years until his capture in May 2011, when police burst into the garden of a small house in northern Serbia. Though he was carrying two handguns, he surrendered without a fight and was extradited to the Netherlands. In the three decades leading up to the violent splintering of Yugoslavia, Mladic rose rapidly through the ranks of the Yugoslav army. In 1991, he served as a front-line commander spearheading Serb forces in a yearlong war with Croatia. By the time he took to Bosnia\u2019s battlefields, he had become a hero to many Serbs, seen as a defender of their dwindling fortunes. In May 1992, Bosnia\u2019s Serbian political leaders picked him to lead the assault on their Muslim enemies who clamored for independence. Mladic wasted no time galvanizing his heavily armed forces in a siege of Sarajevo, cutting the city off from the outside world. Serb forces pounded the city every day from higher ground positions, trapping Sarajevo\u2019s ill-prepared residents in the valley below. As the war ended in the fall of 1995, Mladic went on the run. Shortly after Mladic was sent to The Hague last year, authorities nabbed former Croatian Serb rebel leader Goran Hadzic. He was the last Yugoslav war crimes suspect at large. Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic was arrested in 2008. And Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was arrested in 2001 but died before his trial was completed."

        "content": "Shafilea Ahmed\u2019s parents have long denied killing their pretty teenage daughter for shaming the family, but the \u201chonor murder\u201d case that has gripped Britain took an unexpected turn this week. Shafilea\u2019s mother, Farzana, abruptly changed her story in court and implicated her husband, Iftikhar, in the killing, CNN affiliate ITV reported Monday. Iftikhar and Farzana Ahmed are on trial in Chester, England, accused of killing Shafilea, 17, (pictured left) in September 2003. They have pleaded not guilty. Her dismembered body was found on a riverbank months after she disappeared. She had been stripped of anything that would identify her, prosecutor Andrew Edis told the jury in May, according to ITV. Newspapers, television and radio have all been reporting on the prosecution case that Shafilea\u2019s parents killed her because they felt her \u201cWestern\u201d lifestyle brought shame on the family. Shafilea\u2019s sister Alesha testified last month that she saw her parents kill the teen by stuffing a plastic bag into her mouth. She said her parents were angry that Shafilea was wearing a short-sleeved, V-neck top, and no sweater, on the night she was killed. \u201cJust end it here,\u201d Farzana said to Iftikhar, according to their daughter. They pushed Shafilea down onto a sofa and suffocated her despite her struggles, Alesha testified.  Prosecutor Edis called it \u201can act of suffocation by both parents acting together.\u201d Alesha Ahmed did not tell police she had seen the killing until 2010, after she was detained by police in connection with a robbery of the family\u2019s home, ITV reported. She has pleaded guilty to robbery. Prosecutors said she had not been offered any sort of deal in exchange for testifying against her parents. She has testified that both her parents physically abused Shafilea \u201cevery day\u201d over the course of five years, and that her mother did it more \u201cbecause she was at home more.\u201d On Monday, Farzana unexpectedly said she had seen her husband attack Shafilea. She said that she tried to intervene to protect the girl, but that her husband pushed her away and punched her, ITV reported. \u201cExtremely scared,\u201d she fled the room and stayed in a bedroom with other children until she heard a car leaving 20 minutes later. When her husband returned alone, she asked where their daughter was. \u201cIf you care for your dear life and that of your children, don\u2019t ever ask me this question again,\u201d he told her, ITV reported. Indian police: Man chops off daughter\u2019s head, citing her \u2018indecent behavior\u2019 Farzana Ahmed testified Monday that only one of their children, Mevish, was present when she saw her husband attacking Shafilea. The jury was told that Shafilea had been taken to Pakistan for a hastily arranged marriage before her death, and drank bleach there when her parents suggested she was staying there when the rest of the family returned to England, ITV reported. She was hospitalized for three months after the family came home because of the bleach incident, Alesha testified. Alesha testified in May that her parents were very strict with their daughters, ITV reported. \u201cOur family was very restricted. It was very different. The Pakistani culture is more restrictive in terms of what you can wear or do,\u201d she said. The trial began in May and is expected to last several more weeks, prosecutors say. Reliable figures of the number of honor murders around the world are hard to come by, but the United Nations Population Fund has estimated there could be 5,000 per year. Family convicted in Canada \u2018honor murders\u2019 So-called honor murders are a significant enough problem in Britain that the country\u2019s Crown Prosecution Service has an expert specializing in cases where members of a family kill relatives because of behavior that they say shames the family. The CPS began keeping statistics on honor violence in April 2010 and prosecuted 234 cases in the following year, just over half of which were successful. The CPS expert, Nazir Afzal, told CNN earlier this year that convicting perpetrators can be difficult. \u201cThere is a wall of silence around this, and people are not prepared to talk,\u201d he said. But Afzal insisted that it was \u201cabsolutely important that you bring every single person to justice, because you want to deter other people from doing it.\u201d There is a perception that the crime is particularly common among Muslims, but one vocal British campaigner says not all honor violence is perpetrated by Muslims. Disappearance, then discovery, leads to \u2018honor killing\u2019 outrage Jasvinder Sanghera, who was the victim of a forced marriage, is not Muslim; she is Sikh. \u201cSignificant cases are happening within South Asian communities, be it Pakistani, Indian, Sikh, Muslim, Kurdish, Iranian, Middle Eastern communities,\u201d she said. Afzal says \u201cno faith on Earth\u201d justifies killing.  \u201cAt the end of the day, murder is murder,\u201d he said. \u201cAbrahamic faiths say \u2018Thou shalt not kill.\u2019 At the end of the day, nobody should die for this.\u201d The killings take place in many parts of the world, experts say. Indian father accused of killing baby \u2018for being a girl\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a problem that happens in many different places: the Middle East, Pakistan, Bangladesh and among immigrant communities in North America,\u201d said Nadya Khalife, a researcher on women\u2019s rights in the Arab world for Human Rights Watch. Several Arab countries and territories, including Iraq, Kuwait, Syria, Yemen and the Palestinian territories, have laws providing lesser sentences for honor murders than for other murders, Human Rights Watch says. Egypt and Jordan also have laws that have been interpreted to allow reduced sentences for honor crimes, the group says."

        "content": "If Muhammad Ali, Pele, Tiger Woods, Michael Schumacher and Michael Jordan are arguably the greatest proponents of their respective sports, Roger Federer made a compelling case for joining that pantheon of greats after securing a record-equaling seventh Wimbledon title on Sunday. At the age of 30, considered a grand old age in tennis, he came from behind to leave Andy Murray \u2013 an opponent five years his junior \u2013 shattered and tearful after a gripping three and a half hours on Centre Court. It ended Federer\u2019s two-and-a-half-year wait for a record-extending 17th grand slam title, and equaled his hero Pete Sampras\u2019 seven successes at the All England Club. \u201cI believe Roger is the best player to have ever played the game,\u201d American tennis coach Nick Bollettieri told CNN. \u201cWhen you look at groundstrokes and all parts of the game, there is not a weakness in Novak Djokovic\u2019s technique, movement and recovery,\u201d added Bollettieri, referring to Serbia\u2019s 2012 Australian Open champion \u2013 who Federer beat in Friday\u2019s semifinals. \u201cBut when you come down to who is the best player that can change, that can anticipate and come forward and do anything, then my vote goes to Roger Federer.\u201d Federer\u2019s latest victory ensured his return to the top of the world rankings, ending Djokovic\u2019s 12-month reign, as well as matching Sampras\u2019 record of 286 weeks at No. 1. The Swiss is only the second player in the men\u2019s game to have held the top ranking over the age of 30, alongside Andre Agassi, who was one of the many leading players to attend Bollettieri\u2019s academy in Florida. \u201cI believe Roger thinks in his mind he can win anything,\u201d said Bollettieri, who also helped develop grand slam champions such as Jim Courier, Monica Seles, and Mary Pierce. \u201cWith his game he can play for another two, three or four years and I sincerely believe he\u2019s another two, three or four grand slam titles in him.\u201d Much has been made of the impact Ivan Lendl has had on Murray since becoming his coach in December 2011, but Bollettieri suggested Paul Annacone, who began working with Federer in August 2010, also deserves credit for persuading the four-time Laureus World Sportsman of the Year to adopt a more aggressive approach. \u201cPaul won\u2019t give too much advice to Roger Federer, a little bit here and a little bit there,\u201d said the 80-year-old. American. \u201cHe has him coming in and he has him much looser on that backhand.   \u201cAnnacone has got him hitting the backhand very aggressively and there is a lot of rackethead exploration rather than just blocking the ball.  \u201cRoger\u2019s footwork is meticulous \u2014 it reminds me of Ali. On Sunday he went around the ball a lot and when you do that you give up a lot of court space, so your success depends on your balance when hitting that shot as that is what operates the face of the racket.\u201d While labeling Federer as \u201cbeyond description,\u201d Bollettieri stressed that Murray\u2019s gritty performance in the Wimbledon final bodes well for the future. \u201cEven though he lost, there will be an inner feeling he gave it his all,\u201d said Bollettieri, reflecting on the Scot\u2019s  fourth successive grand slam final defeat \u2013 three of them against Federer. \u201cLendl has brought tremendous focus and a few simple tips on strategy, but he hasn\u2019t messed with his technique and all that crap. Murray\u2019s movement and anticipation is as good as anyone\u2019s in the game.\u201d However if Murray is to win a grand slam, Bollettieri pointed to the hard-court surfaces of either the U.S. or Australian Opens as his best opportunity to break his duck. \u201cI don\u2019t believe grass or clay is the best surface for him. He is so good, but if the bounce is even he can stand closer to the baseline, he can hit aggressive and he can come in.\u201d Australian tennis coach Pete McCraw, who has also worked with Bollettieri, is equally encouraging about Murray\u2019s future. \u201cThe best is yet come for Andy, he is just entering the third phase of his career \u2013 where he has the physical strength and emotional maturity,  as well as the technical skills and experience,\u201d said McCraw, who has worked extensively with stars such as Maria Sharapova and Jelena Jankovic. \u201cWith the British team around him and Lendl\u2019s wisdom, Andy is well positioned to make more grand slam finals in the future.  The previous two finals were premature for Andy; the sport was ready, but he was not. \u201cHe is more mature emotionally.  There are less outbursts and lapses in concentration.  His game from outward appearances is the same, but his mind and emotions are not.   \u201cAs a result he is playing with more structure and patterns, using his strengths more often, whereas in the past he would rely on a wider array of shot against his opponents. \u201c McCraw, who frequently travels to Britain to run coaching workshops, also argues that Murray\u2019s achievement in reaching the Wimbledon final will have a spinoff for grassroots tennis in the UK. \u201cBritish tennis will benefit immensely. It validates the pathway and what\u2019s possible for thousands of aspiring tennis players, and will be indelibly etched in their mind for years to come: \u2018If he can do it, so can I.\u2019 \u201c"

        "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin declared Monday a national day of mourning in the wake of devastating, raging floodwaters that tore through streets in the southern part of the country and killed more than 170 people, according to Russian media reports.  A Russian interior ministry spokesman told the official Itar-Tass news agency late Sunday that 171 people died due to the floods. A vast majority of these deaths \u2013 159, according to the interior ministry \u2013 were in and around Krymsk, a city of about 57,000 residents where torrential rains spurred waters to surge 7 meters (23 feet) as people were sleeping Friday night. Another 10 died in Gelendzhik district and two in the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, Itar-Tass reported. Mourning, search for answers as Russian flooding death toll climbs to 171 \u201cPeople just ran from their homes because there was a huge wall of water,\u201d one woman told the Russian News Service, a Moscow-based radio station.  In addition to the dead, another 320 people sought medical assistance \u2013 104 of whom required hospitalization \u2013 the emergencies ministry reported, according to state-run RIA Novosti. The day of mourning also will remember 14 Russian pilgrims headed to a Ukrainian monastery who died Saturday after their bus swerved off the road and crashed into a ditch in an accident that was not flood-related, state-run media said. Twenty-nine people survived that crash. Yet the higher toll, and the greatest controversy, involves what has happened in recent days in Russia\u2019s Krasnodar region near the Black Sea. One driver, according to the English-language Russian news channel RT, said his truck was pushed tens of meters by floodwaters, while the force of the floodwaters ripped a 10-year-old girl out of her mother\u2019s arms.   Five people in the seaside resort town of Gelendzhik were electrocuted after power lines collapsed into the water. RT, citing witnesses, said a man trying to cross a large puddle was initially electrocuted, and then four others who tried to come to his aid were then killed by the live electrical current.  Those not harmed, but living in the flood-ravaged area, still face plenty of challenges such as no electricity, a disrupted water supply, damaged roads and faulty communication. RIA Novosti reported more than 5,000 homes were flooded, while Itar-Tass said 254 had been destroyed. \u201cThe scale of it is spectacular, to be sure, and very tragic. The water came with such force that it tore up the asphalt,\u201d Krasnodar Gov. Alexander Tkachov said via Twitter after seeing pictures from Krymsk, according to RT. Even with the prospect of more rains and floods on the horizon, officials have begun making promises to the roughly 20,000 people most affected. Devastating India floods leave 95 dead, millions homeless That includes payouts starting Monday of 10,000 rubles (U.S. $304) to each person whose home has been destroyed, reports RIA Novosti. And Tkachov vowed at a public meeting that the government will \u201cbuild \u2026 a new home for you in three to four months, before the beginning of the cold period,\u201d according to the same report. The U.S. government has also vowed support, with a statement on the U.S. Embassy of Moscow\u2019s Facebook page saying Washington is \u201cready to help the Russian government\u201d as it spearheads the recovery effort.  A criminal investigation has been launched by Russian authorities to look into whether there was negligence on the part of any officials for failing to warn residents of potential flooding, RT reported.  Russian Emergencies Minister Vladimir Puchkov has said the flood\u2019s cause was \u201cnot technical,\u201d according to Itar-Tass. This report quoted Russian Investigative Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin as saying \u201cthere were no mass water releases or overflow over the dam\u201d from the Neberdzhayevskoye Reservoir. The Krasnodar region isn\u2019t the only one in Russia to be affected by powerful storms. An emergencies ministry spokesman told Itar-Tass that about 166,000 people in Chechnya were powerless due to a combination of heavy rains and strong winds."

        "content": "Two Britons and an American were gored Monday, the third day of the annual running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain, authorities said. Those three are among seven runners who were rushed to the hospital Monday after the fighting bulls raced through the narrow cobblestone streets of old town Pamplona. There have been 15 deaths since record-keeping began in 1924 and thousands of injuries in the tradition that dates back 400 years. The overall injury count this year \u2013 following just three of the eight consecutive days of running, through July 14 \u2013 is 15 runners hospitalized, including four who were gored. Those sent to the hospital so far are two Britons, two Americans, a Japanese, an Australian and nine Spaniards. The only Spaniard gored so far was a 73-year-old man from Pamplona on Saturday, the first day of the running, authorities reported. Dozens of other runners have been treated at the scene for minor injuries. Author Ernest Hemingway wrote about the bull running in his 1920s novel, \u201cThe Sun Also Rises\u201d (also published under the title \u201cFiesta,\u201d) and crowds have poured in from around the globe ever since. The town has erected a statue to Hemingway outside the bullring. On Monday, two British men, 20 and 29 years old, were gored in their right and left legs, respectively; an American man, 39, was gored in the right leg; and another American man, 38, suffered ankle and knee injuries and also was sent to the hospital, authorities said. Six fighting bulls from the Cebada Gago ranch rushed from the corrals Monday, accompanied by six tame steers to help guide them toward the bullring. All of the pack entered the bullring at 2 minutes, 26 seconds after the race began, according to images of Spanish state television. But a lone black bull was left behind in the crowd for a full minute afterward, causing tension for the runners around it. The bull charged into some runners, appearing to cause injuries, before finally entering the bullring to end the race at 3 minutes, 38 seconds. Images from Monday also showed a man with his left arm around a woman\u2019s shoulder, as they ran together downhill into the bullring, just ahead of the raging bulls. The woman suddenly fell to the ground, but the hospital report Monday listed only seven men, no women. The bulls face certain death against matadors later in the day. The running of the bulls is the marquee event of the weeklong fiesta, named for Pamplona\u2019s patron saint, San Fermin. It includes nonstop activities \u2013 including concerts, parades and amusement park rides \u2013 that aim to appeal to all ages. The event is a huge boon to the local economy."

        "content": "When Se Ri Pak won the U.S. Women\u2019s Open in 1998, she could not have imagined the impact it would have on the golfing world. Then 20 years old, and the only South Korean on the LPGA Tour, Pak won a titanic 20-hole playoff to claim her second major title in her rookie season. She had won the LPGA Championship earlier that year, but it was her success at Blackwolf Run that triggered a phenomenal boom in female golfing talent in both her home country and Asia in general. Four of the last five U.S. Women\u2019s Open champions have been from Korea, most recently Na Yeon Choi \u2013 who on Sunday clinched her first major title with a four-shot victory over compatriot Amy Yang at the same course in Kohler, Wisconsin where Pak inspired so many dreams. \u201cThat was 14 years ago. I was only 10 years old and when I was watching TV, my goal was \u2026 my dream was like I just want to be there,\u201d Choi said on the LPGA website.  \u201cAnd 14 years later I\u2019m here right now, and I made it. My dream\u2019s come true. I really appreciate what Se Ri did and all the Korean players, what they did. It\u2019s really no way I can be here without them. \u201cI really wish like 14 years later from now some junior golfer or some young Korean golfer says, \u2018I was watching on TV how Na Yeon was playing 14 years ago and that inspired me.\u201d Feng aims to be \u2018the Li Na of golf\u2019 after historic LPGA win Pak was there to congratulate Choi, having overcome shoulder problems to take her place in the starting field \u2013 29 of which were Korean. The five-time major winner wrapped up a round of one-under 71, which was good enough for a tie for ninth, as Choi was playing at the adjacent ninth hole. \u201cI\u2019m trying to give her a little look back, but I don\u2019t want her to lose her focus, so I\u2019m trying to not give her a look,\u201d Pak said.  \u201cBut you know, she\u2019s already been there many times. She won five times (on the LPGA Tour) already, and of course, this is a little different than a regular event, but she\u2019s good enough to be out there, she hung in there.\u201d Choi needed to hold her nerve after a triple-bogey at the 10th cut her lead to two shots, and responded with an immediate birdie before a 20-foot par-saving putt at 12 and some lucky bounces off rocks to avoid the water hazard at 13. \u201cThat moment (the triple-bogey) maybe I thought I might screw up today, but I thought I needed to fix that. I can do it,\u201d Choi said. \u201cSo I tried to think what I have to do. So I started to talk with my caddie about just like what airplane tomorrow, or about the car or about the vacation. Not golf.\u201d From military kid to major champion: Creamer\u2019s salute to U.S. soldiers The top 10 featured just three American players, as 2010 winner Paula Creamer tied for seventh with Japan\u2019s Mika Miyazoto while 2007 champion Cristie Kerr and Nicole Castrale were alongside Pak on four over for the tournament. Germany\u2019s Sandra Gal claimed third ahead of South Korea\u2019s Ilhee Lee, LPGA Championship winner Shanshan Feng of China and Italy\u2019s Giulia Sergas in fourth equal. Defending champion So Yeon Ru of Korea was tied for 14th in a group including 17-year-old American Lexi Thompson, who was seeking to become the youngest winner of a major in either the men\u2019s or women\u2019s game.  She had been tied for third after 54 holes, but closed with 78 \u2013 a better closing round might have made her a winner 10 days younger than Tom Morris when he triumphed at the British Open in 1868. Former U.S. teen prodigy Michelle Wie faded from 13th going into the final round to a tie for 35th after carding 80. She was a shot ahead of a group including 15-year-old Korea-born New Zealander Lydia Ko, who was the top amateur in 39th equal. Ko became the youngest player to win a professional tournament in January when still 14. The world\u2019s top-ranked player, Yani Tseng of Taiwan, finished equal 50th alongside veteran former No. 1 Karrie Webb after carding a second successive 78. "

        "content": "One of England\u2019s biggest soccer stars went on trial Monday, accused of hurling racist abuse at another player during a match last year. The normally staid chambers of Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court in London got an earful of shockingly foul language as lawyers and witnesses detailed what Chelsea captain John Terry said to Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand in the match. A lip reader watching a video of the incident told the court what Terry said, including two extremely obscene words. Terry did not deny directing a barrage of foul language at Ferdinand and referring to him as \u201cblack,\u201d but he denied engaging in racist abuse. The highly unusual criminal prosecution over words uttered on a soccer field comes as English soccer officials fight to stamp racism out of the sport, with mixed results. Liverpool player Luis Suarez was banned for eight matches when the Football Association, the English sport\u2019s governing body, found he had racially abused Manchester United defender Patrice Evra. The chanting of racist abuse by fans also remains a sporadic problem in soccer across Europe. The Crown Prosecution Service is pressing charges against Terry for a \u201cracially aggravated public order offense\u201d because of the comments during an October 23 match between Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers. Prosecutors played a video of the incident, without sound, as the case opened Monday morning. The alleged abuse came after Ferdinand knocked Terry down during the game, the jury heard. When he got up, Terry made a gesture as if Ferdinand\u2019s breath smelled, and he called Ferdinand a \u201cc\u2014,\u201d prosecutor Duncan Penny told the court. Ferdinand responded with the same word, saying it described Terry, not him, because Terry had had sex with a teammate\u2019s wife, the prosecutor said. Ferdinand also made an obscene gesture related to sex as Terry ran back into position, Penny said. Ferdinand testified that he did not hear the comments Terry made at him, but that he would have been \u201churt and disappointed\u201d if he had heard Terry call him a \u201cblack c\u2014\u201d \u201cWhen someone brings your color into it, it takes it to another level and it\u2019s very hurtful,\u201d Ferdinand said. Terry maintains that Ferdinand knocked him down before the incident and that the two then exchanged \u201cnormal football verbals.\u201d He told Football Association officials that he then repeated to Ferdinand words he thought the opposing player had said to him, Penny told the court Monday. The maximum penalty for the offense is \u00a32,500 (about $3,900).  That would be a drop in the bucket for a player worth millions, but a criminal conviction could lead to action against him by his team or England\u2019s Football Association. Terry was captain of England\u2019s national team at the time of the incident but was stripped of his captaincy after a preliminary court hearing on the racism charge in February. He remained captain of Chelsea, which went on to win the prestigious Europe-wide Champions League this year. The trial could last up to five days, court officials say."

The German finished on eight-under-par, one shot better than Molinari who recorded a final-round 64 on Sunday, the lowest score of the week at Le Golf National in Paris. The Italian was six shots off the pace prior to Sunday\u2019s finale and double bogeyed the first hole but went on to make nine birdies. But Siem held held firm, despite a dropped shot on the 18th, to take his second title on the European Tour, and his first since the 2004 Dunhill Championship. \u201cI\u2019m so happy. This means a lot to me,\u201d Siem told the European Tour\u2019s official website after picking up a check for $640,000. \u201cFirst, after eight years it doesn\u2019t matter what kind of tournament you won; it\u2019s huge, because you\u2019ve got the confidence again.  \u201cEvery time I\u2019ve played consistent golf this year, and there were so many times up there, I couldn\u2019t make it.  Stupid things happened the whole time. \u201cIt means so much to me to win after that long stretch. It\u2019s all about winning in the end and it puts so much pressure every time you don\u2019t win and people start talking, you will never win again and stuff like that, so it\u2019s very important for me. \u201cI love this golf course. I always loved it and I love it even more or even better now. I\u2019m super happy.\u201d Molinari hit just 29 shots on his closing nine holes and despite missing out on the title, he was delighted with his form. \u201cIt\u2019s been just an unbelievable day really,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a really bad start, but two years ago when I finished second here, I doubled the first on the last day. \u201cFrom then on, it was just great golf. I had a couple of good breaks and finally a lot of putts going in the hole. \u201cI was in the moment, in the zone and I wasn\u2019t really counting the birdies. The game has been feeling well all week and everything was coming out perfect.\u201d World No. 3 Lee Westwood shot a closing round of 70 to finish 40th a day after an injury scare nearly forced him out of the tournament. \u201cThe leg is fine - it wasn\u2019t a problem today,\u201d he said, after fears he may have to miss the year\u2019s third major, the British Open at Royal Lytham and St. Annes starting on Thursday week.  Meanwhile, the U.S. PGA Tour saw a sixth first-time winner this season when rookie Ted Potter Jr. claimed the Greenbrier Classic title after a playoff on Sunday. The 28-year-old beat fellow American Troy Kelly with a four-foot birdie putt at the third extra hole to earn a place at the British Open, the FedEx Cup playoffs and next year\u2019s Masters. He also earned a two-year tour exemption plus the financial security of a $1,098,000 windfall as first prize, having shot a second successive six-under 64 to join Kelly on -16 at the end of 72 holes. \u201cIt was just a big relief,\u201d said the left-hander, who had missed five successive haflway cuts before the West Virginia tournament.  \u201cAll the struggles the last few weeks, knowing that now I\u2019ve got a couple years to try to improve on my game and win some more tournaments.\u201d U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson had led after three rounds, and held a one-shot advantage going into the final nine holes as he did at the Old White TPC course last year, but he faded to a tie for seventh on -11 after three successive bogeys derailed his challenge.

The Australian\u2019s error handed Jorge Lorenzo second place and means he now leads the world championship standings by 16 points from Pedrosa. Stoner slipped to third and was distraught to have thrown away a winning position. He told the BBC: \u201cI\u2019m pretty disappointed, I had planned to go for my \u2018win or bin\u2019 effort in the last corner not that one! \u201cI felt confident but as soon as I tried to turn in a little more, the front went. I was already off the brakes and not in the hard braking area, as soon as I eased of the brakes I guess the weight came off the front and down I went. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated I wasn\u2019t allowed to get up and try and score some points, the bike was perfect, but the marshals pushed me away. \u201cIf we can continue this momentum for the rest of the season then we shouldn\u2019t be so worried for the championship.\u201d It was Pedrosa\u2019s third consecutive German MotoGP victory and he was quickest off the blocks, beating Stoner, who started on pole, to the first corner from third spot. Stoner did reclaim the lead by the end of the opening lap and as the race went on, the pair pulled away from Lorenzo who was a full eight seconds back. But Stoner lost his front wheel going into to one of the final turns and ended up unhurt on the gravel, ensuring a smooth last few corners for Pedrosa. After the race the Spaniard told reporters: \u201cAt the start I wasn\u2019t  comfortable because of changes to my bike.

Federer made it 17 grand slam titles to his name after a two-and-a-half-year drought and matched the haul of American Pete Sampras at the All England Club. The Swiss will return to the top of the world rankings as a result of his 4-6 7-5 6-3 6-4 victory, meaning he will match his hero Sampras\u2019 record of 286 weeks at No. 1.

It\u2019s a great moment.\u201d Federer\u2019s victory means he is only the second player in the men\u2019s game to have held the top ranking over the age of 30, alongside Andre Agassi. \u201cAs we know, the world No. 1, you don\u2019t get that gifted,\u201d he added. \u201cI was up two sets to love in the quarters last year, two sets to love up at the U.S. Open \u2026 so many chances, maybe I got nervous, maybe the other guys were just too good. \u201cI never stopped believing and I started playing more even though I have a family and it all worked out, I got great momentum and confidence and it all came together. It\u2019s a magical moment for me. \u201cI\u2019ve obviously gone through some struggles as well, a lot of changes have happened in my life since so this one comes at the right time, as any grand slam victory.\u201d Murray had started well, spurred on by a fervent home crowd desperate to see a first British winner in the men\u2019s singles since Fred Perry in 1936, breaking Federer in the very first game.  Wimbledon grass faces Olympic race against time and nature And though the 25-year-old then lost his own serve, he summoned another break to take his first set in a grand slam final. As a tense second set neared its climax, Federer then executed two perfect drop shots to stun Murray and take it 7-5. The third set was locked at 1-1 when a heavy burst of rain arrived, forcing the players off court as the recently installed roof was closed. The change in atmosphere played into Federer\u2019s hands as he reappeared rejuvenated. An epic sixth game of the set lasted for 20 minutes and 10 deuces as Murray desperately tried to cling on to his serve. But once Federer secured the break he quickly finished the set and then broke for 3-2 in the final set, sinking to the turf as a cross court forehand from Murray handed him his seventh title. Afterwards, a tearful Murray joked: \u201cI\u2019m getting closer. I\u2019d like to congratulate Roger. I was getting asked the other day after I won my semifinal, was this my best chance  because Roger is 30 now? Well, he\u2019s not bad for a 30-year-old. \u201cHe played a great tournament. He showed what fight he still has in him. So, congratulations Roger you deserve it.\u201d Murray saluted the fans who offered him such support throughout the tournament, and remarked on the pressure that comes with carrying a nation\u2019s hopes of finally ending a 76-year British wait for the men\u2019s title. Expectations had been raised even higher after Jonathan Marray became Britain\u2019s first men\u2019s doubles champion at Wimbledon since 1936 on Saturday. \u201cEveryone always talks about the pressure of playing at Wimbledon but it\u2019s not because of the people watching,\u201d Murray said. \u201cThey make it so much easier to play. The  support has been incredible so thank you.\u201d"

        "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin declared Monday a national day of mourning in the wake of devastating, raging floodwaters that tore through streets in the southern part of the country and killed more than 170 people, Russian media reported. The day of mourning also will remember 14 Russian pilgrims headed to a Ukrainian monastery who died Saturday after their bus swerved off the road and crashed into a ditch in an accident that was not flood-related, state-run media said. Twenty-nine people survived that crash. Yet the higher toll, and the greatest controversy, involves what has happened in recent days in Russia\u2019s Krasnodar region near the Black Sea. A Russian interior ministry spokesman told the official Itar-Tass news agency late Sunday that 171 people died due to the floods. A vast majority of these deaths \u2013 159, according to the interior ministry \u2013 were in and around Krymsk, a city of about 57,000 residents where torrential rains spurred waters to surge 7 meters (23 feet) as people were sleeping Friday night. Another 10 died in Gelendzhik district and two in the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, Itar-Tass reported. \u201cPeople just ran from their homes because there was a huge wall of water,\u201d one woman told the Russian News Service, a Moscow-based radio station.  In addition to the dead, another 320 people sought medical assistance \u2013 104 of whom required hospitalization \u2013 the emergencies ministry reported, according to state-run RIA Novosti. One driver, according to the English-language Russian news channel RT, said his truck was pushed tens of meters by floodwaters, while the force of the floodwaters ripped a 10-year-old girl her mother\u2019s arms.   Five people in the seaside resort town of Gelendzhik were electrocuted after power lines collapsed into the water. RT, citing witnesses, said a man trying to cross a large puddle was initially electrocuted, and then four others who tried to come to his aid were then killed by the live electrical current.  Those not harmed, but living in the flood-ravaged area, still face plenty of challenges such as no electricity, a disrupted water supply, damaged roads and faulty communication. RIA Novosti reported more than 5,000 homes were flooded, while Itar-Tass said 254 had been destroyed. \u201cThe scale of it is spectacular, to be sure, and very tragic. The water came with such force that it tore up the asphalt,\u201d Krasnodar Gov. Alexander Tkachov said via Twitter after seeing pictures from Krymsk, according to RT. Even with the prospect of more rains and floods on the horizon, officials have begun making promises to the roughly 20,000 people most affected. That includes payouts starting Monday of 10,000 rubles ($304 U.S.) to each person whose home has been destroyed, reports RIA Novosti. And Tkachov vowed at a public meeting that the government will \u201cbuild\u2026 a new home for you in three to four months, before the beginning of the cold period,\u201d according to the same report. The U.S. government has also vowed support, with a statement on the U.S. Embassy of Moscow\u2019s Facebook page saying Washington is \u201cready to help the Russian government\u201d as it spearheads the recovery effort.  A criminal investigation has been launched by Russian authorities to look into whether there was negligence on the part of any officials for failing to warn residents of potential flooding, RT reported.  Russian Emergencies Minister Vladimir Puchkov has said the flood\u2019s cause was \u201cnot technical,\u201d according to Itar-Tass. This report quoted Russian Investigative Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin as saying \u201cthere were no mass water releases or overflow over the dam\u201d from the Neberdzhayevskoye Reservoir. The Krasnodar region isn\u2019t the only one in Russia to be affected by powerful storms. An emergencies ministry spokesman told Itar-Tass that about 166,000 people in Chechnya were powerless due to a combination of heavy rains and strong winds."

        "content": "Mark Webber and Red Bull judged their race strategy perfectly to pip Fernando Alonso to the checkered flag during an action packed British Grand Prix at Silverstone. The Australian maneuvered expertly through 52 immensely tactical laps to record his second victory of the season, though Ferrari\u2019s Alonso did maintain his lead in the drivers\u2019 championship. With the torrential rain that had affected the build up absent for the entire race, Webber hunted down Alonso in the closing stages as the Spaniard\u2019s tires began to wear, eventually overtaking on lap 49. Defending double world champion Sebastian Vettel, also of Red Bull, came third while Alonso\u2019s Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa finished fourth. Silverstone support: Does home advantage help in F1? \u201cIt was a very interesting race. Fernando Alonso had very good pace,\u201d Webber told a press conference after his victory. \u201cWe had the better strategy in the end. We never gave up, kept pushing and it did not work out in the end for Fernando. \u201cI\u2019ve had a few wins, but this one is taking a little bit to sink in. It didn\u2019t look like a spectacular race between us initially, but it was one \u2013 pacing the stints on the tires, Fernando starting on the harder tire. \u201cAfter the first stint Fernando had I thought he was in good shape to close the win out. But it came our way and I am absolutely over the moon. \u201cI had a single opportunity to pounce and I wasn\u2019t going to let that slip. Fernando, with the front-left tire, if you lose balance around this place, the speed is very high in that second sector and it\u2019s very hard for the driver to do something. \u201cIt was obvious he was pushing as hard as possible but the balance wasn\u2019t with him.\u201d It was Webber\u2019s second win at Silverstone in three years and helped him cut Alonso\u2019s lead at the top of the drivers\u2019 standings to 13 points. Alonso has 129 to Webber\u2019s 116, with Vettel third on 100 points. Alonso said: \u201cIt was very close today but at the end Mark was much quicker than us and deserved the victory. Now we are fighting for victories in the last three or four grands prix.  \u201cI hope the fans enjoyed the show today. I\u2019m still leading the championship and that\u2019s the main target for us, we lost seven points with Mark winning but we gained some more points on the rest of the field.\u201d World champion Vettel added: \u201cMark deserved to win. Thanks for all fans out there \u2013 it\u2019s  been horrible weather for them, not just for us. But today the sun came out and  British summer showed its best.\u201d Starting on pole, Alonso protected his lead even after a pit stop on lap 16 but the hard tires on Lewis Hamilton\u2019s McLaren car set up a tussle for first place on lap 19. The lead changed hands several times as the former McLaren teammates battled round the circuit. Eventually, Alonso came out on top and Webber moved up to third when Hamilton pitted. The Spaniard was forced into his own stop for a set of compulsory soft tires as a furious round of strategic stops took place around lap 38. And try as he might, Alonso couldn\u2019t hold off Webber as his tires faded fast, allowing the Australian to make his decisive move three laps from home. There was also controversy further down the field as Sauber\u2019s Sergio Perez blasted his Williams counterpart Pastor Maldonado for a crash that put the Mexican out of the race. Perez said of the Venezuelan: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t respect other drivers. I was already in front and he should have given space not to crash, but he tried to push me all the way. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he drives like that and I hope the stewards do something. It is not first time he has damaged my weekend. This guy will never learn if they don\u2019t do something. He could hurt someone. Everybody has concerns about him.\u201d Maldonado was later reprimanded and fined $12,000 by the sport\u2019s governing body, the FIA, for the collision while Sauber driver Kamui Kobayashi from Japan was fined $30,000 for injuring three three mechanics during a pit-stop. The next race in the Formula One calendar is the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim on July 22. "

        "content": " Sir Richard Branson \u2013 Virgin Group Balloons, airlines and now, spaceflight. There\u2019s no doubt that Virgin entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson has aviation in his blood.  Having conquered lighter-than-air and passenger air travel, he has now set his sights on operating the world\u2019s first \u2018spaceline\u2019 with Virgin Galactic.  Unpowered test flights mean that his sub-orbital spaceplane SpaceShipTwo is counting down to its first commercial flight (and Branson, along with his mother Eve, aims to be on it).  At Farnborough he is showing off a full-size mock-up of this space vehicle \u2013 giving the public on this side of the Atlantic a chance to see it and share in the excitement. Branson is also tipped to announce Virgin Galactic Cargo at the air show, which would use elements of his sub-orbital space tourism system to provide a responsive, lower-cost system for mini satellites.  For would-be space tourists, the ticket price ($200,000) for a few minutes of weightlessness may be high, but Branson has already signed up around 500 customers, including Professor Stephen Hawking, Angelina Jolie and advertising guru Trevor Beattie.At this stage space tourism may be more like an extreme adventure sport, than air travel as we know it, but pioneering Virgin Galactic will be a key step in opening up spaceflight for all.      Watch: What\u2019s hot at this year\u2019s Farnborough Airshow?  Steven Udvar-Hazy \u2013 Air Lease Corporation Why buy an expensive, quickly depreciating asset like a modern jetliner \u2013 when you can rent?  This is the philosophy that has turned Hungarian-born Steven Udvar-Hazy into a billionaire and key player on the global aviation scene, creating the giant International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) in 1973.  Having now moved on to found a new leasing company, ALC (Air Lease Corp), he is building this up and will be on the lookout for more deals \u2013 he spent roughly $10bn at the previous Farnborough show in 2010 building up ALC\u2019s portfolio.  His bulk buying power and insight into what airlines really need, rather than what they would like, make him a valued and highly influential customer for Airbus and Boeing \u2013 and he is not reticent about telling manufacturers about aircraft what they should be building.  Having been pressing Boeing to make the leap with a clean sheet new single-aisle airliner \u2013 Hazy is now rumored to be ready to place the first lessor order for up to 100 Boeing 737 MAXs \u2013 which could be announced at Farnborough.  With leasing allowing airlines to mix and match fleets and to trade up to the latest fuel-efficient aircraft quickly \u2013 the worlds\u2019 leased airliner fleet is set to keep expanding \u2013 on the model pioneered by Udvar-Hazy.  His ultra-sharp business sense is matched by his love of aviation \u2013 having donated $66m to the Smithsonian to fund the National Air & Space museum that bears his name.

If there is ever a real-life Tony Stark it is Elon Musk, founder of new space company \u2018SpaceX\u2019. (Indeed Musk appeared in a cameo role in Iron Man 2). Having made his money from creating PayPal, Musk is now revolutionizing space access, with his Falcon rockets promising lower-cost per kg into orbit as well as taking over from NASA in regular resupply missions to the International Space Station (ISS).  Earlier this year his Dragon capsule made history by becoming the first private spacecraft to dock with the ISS and then return to Earth. But his ambitions don\u2019t end in low-Earth orbit \u2013 Musk\u2019s goal is opening up manned Mars missions in the next 10 to 20 years.  It is this vision of commercial spaceflight, along with a track record of success, that is making SpaceX the destination for the best and brightest MIT graduates \u2013 a role that NASA used to occupy.  Rocket science is hard \u2013 but the way in which Musk and SpaceX are making it look effortless to outsiders makes him one to watch.    Tom Enders \u2013 EADS How many aerospace CEOs check their products by skydiving out of the back of one? German EADS chief Tom Enders did when he parachuted out of the back of an A400M transport aircraft.  Former paratrooper Enders did it in his previous role as head of aircraft maker Airbus, when he steered the company successfully in the post-Noel Forgeard era \u2013 helping to eliminate the national divisions that had held the company back and restoring customer trust in the company after A380 delays.  Now installed as CEO of parent group EADS, Enders will be focusing on the civil airline sector on development of Airbus\u2019s carbon-fibre airliner \u2013 the A350XWB, as well as delivering the huge backlog of orders that Airbus has built up \u2013 particularly in the single-aisle segment, where the A320neo has been a runway success.  To that end, Airbus has recently announced it will expand its global footprint westwards, adding a fourth final assembly line in Alabama \u2013 and making a strategic move right into Boeing\u2019s backyard to aim at the U.S. airline market. On military products, the outlook is less rosy \u2013 the A400M is needed badly \u2013 but its non-flying display status at the show will be something of a sore point for Enders.  Finally, as EADS chief Enders will also be tackling the challenges of Eurofighter sales after losing the India fighter order, as well as whether the group attempt to join Anglo-French drone efforts, or goes it alone.      Infographic: Up in the air: Industry in numbers      Jim McNerney - Boeing  Head of the giant aerospace concern that is Boeing, Jim McNerney has been CEO since 2005 \u2013 and oversees Boeing\u2019s varied portfolio of civil airliner, military aircraft and space products. This Farnborough, (with commercial airplanes chief Jim Albraugh stepping down in favour of Ray Conner) Boeing will be in sales mode for its civil products, with its new narrow-body offering, the 737MAX and the revamped 747-8i.  McNerney will want to hit the target of 1,000 MAX orders by the end of the year, and Farnborough will be a key place to get the message across to potential buyers and announce sales.  The company will also be boosted by the first air show appearance in airline colors of the much anticipated, but delayed 787 Dreamliner, which will take part in the daily flying display.  Like Airbus, McNerney also faces the challenge of ramping up 737 and 787 production to meet the demand from airlines \u2013 as well as exploring a revamp of the best-selling 777.  In defense, McNerney faces the looming dagger in the US that is \u2018sequestration\u2019 or across the board government defense cuts.  Here Boeing\u2019s response has not been to go into retreat, but to aggressively target export sales for its military products \u2013 especially for aircraft such as the C-17, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and V-22 as well as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) solutions like drones.  This seems to be paying off already - in the past 5 years Boeing Defense\u2019s international revenues have jumped from 7% to 25%.        Marcus Bryson \u2013 chief GKN Aerospace He\u2019s not a semi-household name like the others, but Marcus Bryson, CEO and President of Britain\u2019s GKN Aerospace will be going to Farnborough this year having secured a major deal and strategic aim \u2013 with its recent $987m acquisition of engine supplier Volvo Aero.  This boosts his GKN Aerospace business as a whole to 40% of the company (the rest of GKN is automotive) and positions it as a \u2018Super Tier 1\u2019 supplier with a global reach.  With products that span both civil and defense, and which include composite structures for Airbus, fighter canopies for Lockheed Martin, as well as exploiting new technologies such as 3D printing for aerospace, GKN exemplifies the kind of hi-tech, highly-skilled export-focused manufacturing the UK Government would like to see more of. It\u2019s move into increasing its aero engine business was a long-term goal in expanding the range of products it supplies.  In pictures: 48 years of Farnborough airshow   Akbar Al Baker \u2013 Qatar Airways  The forthright CEO of Qatar Airways, Akbar Al Baker has transformed an airline from a previously little-known Gulf state airline into a global carrier that oozes luxury and by placing big orders now finds himself a key figure in the aviation world. His pronouncements at air shows are legendary and grab headlines, but can make aircraft manufacturers squirm \u2013 when he has, in the past bluntly told them (and the world\u2019s media) what was wrong with their aircraft.  He is also known to drive a hard bargain in negotiations. Indeed it was his desire to see the 787 fly in Qatar colors at the show that was probably critical to Boeing breaking a 28-year rule of not flying its airliners in airshows. Along with fellow Gulf airline CEOs, Tim Clarke (Emirates) and James Hogan (Eithad) Al Baker has a significant hand in influencing both Airbus and Boeing\u2019s wide body product development as these fast growing carriers, which sit on the crucial geographic link between Europe and Asia-Pacific become global airlines.  The airliner manufacturers may not like what Al Baker says \u2013 but they listen hard.      Tony Fernandes \u2013 Air Asia An airline CEO who gets his hands dirty and mucks in with baggage handling? That would be AirAsia\u2019s chief Tony Fernandes, who combines a highly personable nature with a cast-iron business vision that is sweeping across Asia-Pacific \u2013 low-cost air travel for the masses.  This year he picked up his 100th Airbus A320 for Air Asia \u2013 the fastest-growing airline in Asia-Pacific. Ten years ago as former record executive, Fernandes was looking for a new outlet for his incredible energy, when he spotted easyJet founder Stelios on TV. The rest, as they say, is history,.  In the past decade Malaysia-based Air Asia has not only grown massively, but also Fernandes has created spin\u2013off affiliate airlines Thai AirAsia, Indonesia AirAsia and Air Asia Philippines as well as Air Asia Japan \u2013 that give a distinct Air Asia common brand.  So far his only misstep has been long-haul low-cost Air Asia X, (which awaits Airbus\u2019 new A350XWB to be profitable) and an aborted share swap with Malaysian Airlines.  And while Fernandes is a canny business operator \u2013 his low-cost AirAsia brand is fresh, funky and fun \u2013 engaging and winning over customers. (In the aftermath of the 2005 Bali bomb the airline was the first to re-establish flights and gave away free tickets to boost tourism).  But it is not just passengers who have been won over. With 175 Airbus A320s ordered, last year he stunned the Paris Airshow with a giant purchase of 200 Airbus A320neos and has hinted he may add another 50 airliners on top of that.   The pent-up demand for air travel in Asia-Pacific means that other airlines are now racing to catch up with Fernandes\u2019 lead, in the most dynamic civil aviation sector. Quiz: Test your aviation knowledge  Serge Dassault \u2013Dassault Group Not many aerospace executives can boast their family name in the company, but Serge Dassault, Chairman and Chief Executive of the Dassault Group can.  Having built up a personal fortune, and with interests in politics and media, the well-connected Dassault is probably the one of the last \u2018elder statesman\u2019 in European aviation. One of the French elite, Dassault\u2019s aviation interests split into civil (with its Dassault Falcon family of high-end business jets) and its Mirage and Rafale fighters. While business aviation may be flat at the moment, this year Dassault scored a massive win over the Eurofighter consortium when its Rafale fighter was selected by India for a 126-aircraft procurement.  However, beyond that, the distinguished Dassault may have concerns over the future of the European combat aircraft industry \u2013 which is facing squeezed military budgets.  A tie-up with the UK on future Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) development is set to be firmed up at Farnborough, which will see Dassault and Britain\u2019s BAE Systems collaborate on a new armed UAV and potentially pool their efforts in stealth unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV) technology too.      Michael O\u2019Leary - Ryanair Love him or hate him \u2013 there\u2019s no doubt that Ryanair\u2019s Michael O\u2019Leary steals the headlines when it comes to air travel, whether it is \u2018paying for on-board toilets\u2019 or considering \u2018standing room only\u2019 flights.  A self-confessed anti-\u2018aerosexual\u2019 (his words), his larking about in dressing up as the Pope, or wearing a bikini at press conferences disguises an extremely shrewd operator who has changed the face of European air travel with his low-cost approach, outmanoeuvred rivals and forced legacy carriers to evolve.  His strategy relies on a young fleet, working the aircraft hard and then selling on quickly to maximise investment. However, after securing mega deals in the past, Ryanair has run into the challenge of both difficult conditions in the eurozone and in both Airbus and Boeing wising up to him playing both of them against each other in the search for a better bargain.  To that end he has begun flirting with China\u2019s COMAC about its new single-aisle airliner, the C919 and last year at Paris signed an MoU to collaborate on development.  For a man who normally stays clear of the \u2018nuts and bolts\u2019 of aviation \u2013 this seems an odd move \u2013 leading some to speculate that this is O\u2019Leary taking brinkmanship to new levels in getting a better offer from Airbus or Boeing.  Others are not so sure and wonder if there is one person who would be bold enough to provide the breakthrough in Western sales for the C919 and destroy Airbus\u2019s and Boeing\u2019s cosy duopoly \u2013 it would be O\u2019Leary.

        "content": "An estimated 6 million Jews died at the hands of the Nazis and their allies during the Holocaust. Hundreds of thousands more suffered, but somehow survived, in concentration camps. And some escaped, savoring freedom they otherwise never would have known. Then there\u2019s Ernst Hess, who was a decorated World War I soldier, former judge and, despite being raised a Protestant and marrying someone of that faith, a \u201cfull-blooded Jew\u201d in the eyes of the Nazi regime. According to a groundbreaking report, Hess was granted a reprieve despite this designation thanks to none other than Adolf Hitler. Susanne Mauss, editor of the Jewish Voice from Germany newspaper, found the August 27, 1940, note from the Gestapo (the infamous Nazi secret police) that saved Hess \u2013 albeit temporarily. The order was revoked the next year, and Hess spent years doing hard labor in Nazi concentration camps and work sites. Still, given Hitler and his colleagues\u2019 extreme views and actions on Jews, even the temporary amnesty granted in the letter that Mauss unearthed in a file kept by the Gestapo in Dusseldorf about Hess is extraordinary. Swiss man reintroduces his cousin: Anne Frank Written by the notorious SS figure Heinrich Himmler, the note calls for saving and protecting Hess \u201cas per the Fuhrer\u2019s wishes,\u201d referring to Hitler, who had led Germany since 1933. The letter, a copy of which is posted on the Jewish Voice from Germany\u2019s website, also states that Hess should not be inconvenienced \u201cin any way whatsoever.\u201d Hitler and Hess had crossed paths before, serving in the same infantry unit during World War I. In fact, for a short time Hess had been Hitler\u2019s commander \u2013 though the Jewish Voice from Germany said Hess, whose now 86-year-old daughter was interviewed for their story, didn\u2019t personally know Hitler and their fellow comrades described the future Nazi leader as quiet, with no friends in the regiment. But Hess himself was close to many of his fellow veterans, including Fritz Wiedemann, according to daughter Ursula Hess. And Wiedemann, who became a top aide to Hitler from 1934 to 1939 before becoming Germany\u2019s consul in San Francisco through 1941, helped connect Hess to Hans Heinrich Lammers, the head of the Reich Chancellery during Hitler\u2019s reign. Hess, who was forced to retire as a judge in 1936 \u2013 the same year he was beaten up by special police in front of his home \u2013 had pleaded for leniency before. According to the Jewish Voice, he had petitioned Hitler to make an exception because his daughter Ursula would be considered a \u201cfirst-degree half-breed\u201d under Nazi doctrine.  Highlighting his patriotism and Christian upbringing, Hess wrote, \u201cFor us, it is kind of spiritual death to now be branded as Jews and exposed to general attempt.\u201d That appeal was denied, though the Hess family was able to move to a then German-speaking part of Italy for the next several years. In that time, Hess still got part of his military pension and his passport wasn\u2019t stamped with a red J to brand him as Jewish, the Jewish Voice reported.  But after a pact with Italy that ceded that area to the Nazi regime and the family\u2019s attempts to flee to Switzerland and Brazil failed, they landed back in Germany in 1940. Rareview: finding a place for Yiddish The reprieve, credited to the fuhrer, came in the summer of that year. But in 1941, Hess submitted the letter of protection, only to have it swiped away. The special order revoked, he landed soon thereafter in a concentration camp, and then began working for a timber processing company helping build barracks for Nazi soldiers. \u201cThe slave workers were forced to live outdoors and were treated terribly, and of course they were watched by members of the SS,\u201d said Ursula Hess of her father, who besides being a soldier, judge and \u201csportsman,\u201d had once been a concert violinist. \u201cHad he not been as fit as he was, he would never have survived.\u201d The name Hess is well established in German 20th-century history. A man also named Ernst Hess was one of Germany\u2019s ace fighter pilots during World War I, before being killed in action. Rudolf Hess was once Hitler\u2019s deputy, before flying to Scotland on an alleged peace mission in 1941 that instead ended with him becoming a prisoner of war. Ernst Hess, though, was a prisoner of a very different sort through the early 1940s when Nazi authorities deemed him \u201ca Jew like no other.\u201d When the war ended and he gained his freedom, according to the Jewish Voice report, Hess was asked to become a judge yet again. He turned down the offer. A year later, Hess launched a new career and gained new prominence as a railway executive. By then, he\u2019d rejoined his wife and daughter. But not all his family: His sister Berta was killed in 1942 in the Auschwitz concentration camp."

        "content": "Andy Murray and Roger Federer are both carrying the weight of expectation and history into Sunday\u2019s men\u2019s singles final at Wimbledon. Murray snapped a 74-year streak when he became the first British man to reach the final at the All England Club and will want to end a 76-year long wait for the tennis success starved nation by actually winning a men\u2019s grand slam title. The legendary Fred Perry claimed both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open titles in 1936, but since then nothing, despite the brave efforts of Andy Murray\u2019s predecessor as British number one, Tiger Henman. Virginia Wade was the last British winner of a grand slam at Wimbledon in 1977, the year of the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. Maybe that will be an omen because 2012 marks the Diamond Jubilee of the British monarch, who made a rare visit to SW19 to see Wade win all those years ago. Wishful thinking But that sort of historic wishful thinking is unlikely to make much impression on Federer and even Murray admits he needs to play the \u201cperfect match\u201d to beat the Swiss maestro. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the greatest ever players. He\u2019s been doing it consistently over a number of years. He\u2019s very, very tough to beat here,\u201d Murray told gathered reporters after his four-set semifinal win over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France. \u201cIt\u2019s a great challenge, one where I\u2019m probably not expected to win, but one that, if I play well, I\u2019m capable of winning. The pressure that I would be  feeling if it was against somebody else I guess it would be different. \u201cBut there will be less on me on Sunday because of who he is.\u201d Murray\u2019s clever attempt to deflect pressure and focus it on Federer underestimates the expectations of a sports mad country, who have filled just about every seat for every day of every event at the 2012 London Olympics later this month. Britain is likely to come to a standstill Sunday afternoon as television sets are tuned into the live broadcast and in his home town of Dunblane in Scotland special celebrations are planned. Formidable opponent  Murray is right though. Federer is a formidable opponent and can set a string of records if he beats the number four seed and home hope. It will be a record equaling seventh Wimbledon title in the Open Era, drawing level with Pete Sampras, who coincidentally had the same coach, Paul Annacone, as Federer. He will extend his own record to 17 grand slam titles and victory will also take him back to the top of the world rankings, also beating another Sampras record for successive weeks at the top of the men\u2019s game. For a 30-year-old, considered to be a waning force, it would be a remarkable performance, made possible by his four-set dismissal of the previously dominant Novak Djokovic to reach a record eighth Wimbledon final. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot on the line for me. I\u2019m not denying that. I have a lot of pressure, as well. I\u2019m looking forward to that. That\u2019s what I work hard for,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked extremely hard since I lost that match point against Novak last year at the U.S. Open.  \u201cMy run has been extremely good. Now I have a chance at world No. 1, and at the title again all at once. \u201cSo it\u2019s a big match for me.\u201d  Missed chance Federer missed that chance against Djokovic in the semifinal of the U.S. Open last year, losing a five-set thriller and it looked as if it might be his last with the likes of Rafael Nadal, who made a surprising early exit at Wimbledon, and Murray making it even more difficult to land a grand slam. He would be the first man since Andre Agassi at the Australian Open in 2003 to win one of the top four tournaments in tennis past the age of 30 and only Australian legend Rod Laver and American Arthur Ashe have achieved that feat at Wimbledon. Murray also holds an 8-7 career record over Federer, but the last time the pair met in a grand slam final, at the Australian Open in 2010, he was given a tennis lesson by the man from Basel. But with inspiration and valuable advice from a new coach, eight-time grand slam winner Ivan Lendl, the 25-year Murray may just be ready to bring some much needed cheer to a country in the grip of austerity and in the middle of one of its wettest summers on record.

        "content": "Serena Williams fended off a stirring fightback from Agnieszka Radwanska to win her fifth Wimbledon singles title with a 6-1 5-7 6-2 victory Saturday. It was the 30-year-old American\u2019s 14th grand slam crown and her first since winning at the All England Club in 2010, but Poland\u2019s Radwanska made her fight every inch of the way. Suffering from a respiratory problem and trailing after a one-sided first set, Radwanska recovered from a break down in the second to give Williams a real Centre Court scare. After leveling at one set all, Radwanska took a 2-1 lead in the decider before Williams romped to victory with a run of five straight games. She celebrated by climbing into the players\u2019 box to embrace her sister Venus and other close connections including her physiotherapist Esther Lee. Williams spent almost a year on the sidelines, being struck by first injury then serious illness after being laid low by dangerous blood clots. Historic victories, crushing defeats at Wimbledon A visibly emotional Williams showed how much victory meant to her in her post-match interview.   \u201cI can\u2019t describe it. I almost didn\u2019t make it a few years ago. I was in hospital and I thought I\u2019d never be here again, so this makes it so worth it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all the sweeter. I was so down but you never give up. You have to continue,\u201d she added. Williams has capped her steady return to the top with an emphatic performance on the grass courts, particularly since the quarterfinals where she dispatched reigning champion Petra Kvitova. A semifinal win over Victoria Azarenka of the Belarus took Williams into the final, but Azarenka will have the consolation of going to the top of the new world rankings Monday. Radwanska will rise to number two off the back of her fine run and has enhanced her growing reputation. \u201cI am very proud to have got to the final. I am still shaking but I tried,  it just wasn\u2019t my day,\u201d the 23-year-old told BBC Sport. \u201cI have been unlucky here, playing in the wind and the rain, but I still played some great matches.\u201d Williams, who wins $1.78 million, is the first woman over 30 to win Wimbledon since Martina Navratilova in 1990 and has now matched the Wimbledon singles tally of her elder sister Venus.   They later paired up to win their fifth Wimbledon women\u2019s doubles title, beating Czech duo Andrea Hlavackova and Lucie Hradecka, 7-5 6-4. The match finished under the lights just before 2300 local time and set the seal on a triumphant day for Serena. She will now look to do the double again at the London Olympics which begin later this month at Wimbledon. The intervening match on Centre Court saw unseeded pair Britain\u2019s Jonny Marray and Denmark\u2019s Freddie Nielsen beat Sweden\u2019s Robert Lindstedt and Romania\u2019s Horia Tecau 4-6 6-4 7-6 6-7 6-3 in a thrilling men\u2019s doubles final. Marray, 31, is the first Briton since 1936 to win that title at Wimbledon, an omen perhaps for Andy Murray, who is attempting the same record in terms of years in the men\u2019s singles final against Roger Federer Sunday.

The Silverstone track in central England was hit by a deluge during the second part of qualifying and the session was held up for nearly two hours. When the action resumed, Ferrari\u2019s Alonso showed his undoubted class with a one minute 51.746 seconds clocking, edging out Red Bull\u2019s Mark Webber for first place on the grid. Seven-time champion Michael Schumacher reveled in the conditions in his Mercedes and took third fastest ahead of reigning double champion Sebastian Vettel of Germany in his Red Bull.      It will be Spaniard Alonso\u2019s first pole since the 2010 Singapore Grand Prix, but he took his home race in Valencia a fortnight ago to become the first man to achieve two wins in an unpredictable season. \u201cIt was not easy. To complete a lap with no huge mistakes is not easy in these conditions,\u201d he told the official press conference.  \u201cI\u2019m happy to be on pole after nearly two years. In these conditions the qualifying is probably the least important of the year but obviously for visibility it is always better to be on pole.\u201d His teammate Felipe Massa also backed him up with an improved performance to take a competitive fifth, his best in qualifying this season. Massa has faced questions about his future with the team after only gaining 11 points to date in 2012, but the Brazilian has told CNN that he is confident he will get a new deal with Ferrari. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time this thing happened to me at the end of the contract and we renew it,\u201d he said.  \u201cPersonally I didn\u2019t have the start to the season I wanted but I\u2019m much stronger now, much better now, and I\u2019m sure we can be competitive race-by-race now until the end of the year,\u201d he added. Former world champion Kimi Raikkonen was sixth for Lotus-Renault with young Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado in seventh for Williams-Renault.    Home hope Lewis Hamilton was fastest in his McLaren after Q2, but struggled to find grip when it really mattered and was a frustrated eighth fastest. His teammate Jenson Button also endured another miserable afternoon and failed to make the cut for Q2, ending only 18th best.   "

The death toll has climbed steadily through the day as the waters have gradually subsided, allowing police to find more bodies in flooded buildings in Krymsk.  Television footage from the Krasnodar region showed scenes of flooded streets, stranded vehicles and people wading through torrents of knee-deep muddy water outside homes. The state-run Ria Novosti news agency said dozens of passenger trains have been diverted in the region as the water level remains 19 inches above the tracks.

        "content": "A 73-year-old Spanish man was gored in the right leg on the first day of the annual running of the bulls in Pamplona and a 21-year-old Japanese runner was dragged by a bull, authorities said. Those were two of six runners who were rushed to the hospital after the frenetic race down the narrow cobblestone streets of the old Spanish town. One of the others taken to the hospital was a 26-year-old Australian who suffered a knee injury. The Red Cross also  treated 72 others for minor injuries at the scene, authorities said. The runner from Ikeda, Japan \u2013 whose gender was not immediately released \u2013 was dragged by what appeared to be a bull\u2019s horn, hooked through clothing, on the pavement downhill toward the bullring, images from Spanish state television showed. The runner suffered back injuries. There have been 15 deaths since record-keeping began in 1924 and thousands of injuries in the tradition that dates back 400 years.   Author Ernest Hemingway wrote about it in his 1920s novel, \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d also published under the title, \u201cFiesta,\u201d and crowds have poured in from around the globe ever since. The town has since erected a statue to Hemingway outside the bullring. The running starts at 8 a.m. (2 a.m. ET) for eight consecutive days, through July 14, and lasts just a few minutes, from the corrals through the hard pavement of old town streets to the bullring, where the bulls face certain death against matadors later in the day. What happened last year The weekends of the fiesta traditionally see the largest crowds, when Pamplona\u2019s population of 200,000 can triple.  The race was packed on Saturday, and the run lasted just two minutes and 53 seconds to cover the 825-meter (902 yard) course. The six fighting bulls from the Dolores Aguirre Ybarra ranch, each weighing about a half ton, stayed together for the first part of the course. At one point four of them charged ahead, as runners behind tried to dodge the two remaining bulls trying to catch up. The Spanish man was the only one gored on Saturday. Besides the Japanese and the Australian, the other three sent to hospital were Spaniards, aged 19 to 49, who suffered shoulder, rib or wrist injuries, authorities said. The bulls were accompanied, as usual, by a pack of six tame steers to help guide them to the bullring. The running of the bulls is the marquee event of the week-long fiesta, named for Pamplona\u2019s patron saint, San Fermin. It includes non-stop activities, including concerts, parades and amusement park rides, that aim to appeal to all ages. The event is huge boon to the local economy.  Gotta Watch: Animals on the run "

She is the seventh person detained in connection with an investigation by the London Metropolitan Police\u2019s Counter Terrorism Command. The operation in London is not linked to the Olympic and Paralympic Games, police have said. However, security is a central concern for UK authorities and the organizers of the Olympic Games, which start in three weeks, and police and intelligence agencies have stepped up monitoring efforts. Is Olympic-level security already under way in Britain? The woman detained Saturday morning in Hackney is undergoing questioning in south east London, police said. She was arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. Six other suspects \u2013 five men and a woman ages 18 to 30 \u2013 were all arrested Thursday, also on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, police said. Officers searched homes in east, west and north London, as well as business premises in east London. One of the men arrested had worked from 2007 to 2009 as a police community support officer for the Met Police, the force said in a statement, and \u201cwas not deployed in a specialist or sensitive role.\u201d Police community support officers are members of staff who work alongside the regular police force, mostly to tackle local anti-social behavior and low level issues. Also on Thursday, armed police in Staffordshire closed a major highway and called in bomb disposal squads when a passenger on a bus raised the alarm over smoke coming from a fellow traveler\u2019s bag. The source turned out to be a quit-smoking aid, and no arrests were made. Seven men were also arrested this week in the West Midlands and West Yorkshire on suspicion of terror offenses after firearms were found in a car stopped by police, West Midlands police said Friday. It is understood that the individuals arrested in the West Midlands and West Yorkshire were not targeting the Olympics, nor did they have any links to those arrested Thursday in London.  Following the arrests, the UK Home Office website has not changed the terror threat level from \u201csubstantial,\u201d which is the third highest of five levels. The next level up is \u201csevere,\u201d which means an attack is \u201chighly likely,\u201d and the highest is \u201ccritical,\u201d meaning an attack is \u201cexpected imminently.\u201d Additional security measures will be in place in London and elsewhere during the Olympics, which start in three weeks.

Assange is believed to still be inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has been holed up since applying for political asylum on June 19. The South American country has said it is considering his application. The UK Supreme Court  dismissed his bid to reopen his appeal against extradition to Sweden on June 14.  \u201cThe court has ordered that the required period for extradition shall not commence until the 14th day after today,\u201d the Swedish Prosecution Authority said at the time.  \u201cIn accordance with the framework on European arrest warrants, the court\u2019s decision means that Mr. Assange will be surrendered to Sweden within 10 days after the 14th day.\u201d Karin Rosander, a spokeswoman for Sweden\u2019s Prosecution Authority, confirmed earlier that Saturday was the expected deadline for Assange\u2019s surrender. UK police say Assange is in violation of his bail by staying at the embassy, and that ignoring the notice to turn himself in is a further violation. However, they are unable to enter the embassy under diplomatic protocol. London\u2019s Metropolitan Police had declined to comment on whether any action would be taken Saturday. Assange is seeking to avoid being sent to Sweden over claims of rape and sexual molestation. He has been arrested in absentia, Swedish prosecutors have said. He was arrested in Britain in 2010 because Swedish authorities wanted to question him about the allegations, which he denies. His bail conditions included staying every night at the home of a supporter outside of London. Two women have accused Assange of sexually assaulting them in August 2010, when he was visiting Sweden in connection with a WikiLeaks release of internal U.S. military documents. He was arrested in Britain that December and has been fighting extradition ever since, saying the allegations are retribution for his organization\u2019s disclosure of American secrets. Susan Benn, of the Julian Assange defense fund, said on June 29 that Assange would not honor a notice served to him by British police a day earlier requiring him to turn himself in to authorities. Benn said the United States had empaneled a grand jury in its goal to press charges against Assange. Turning himself in would have started a process that would end with Assange being extradited to the United States, she said.  WikiLeaks, which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information, has published about 250,000 confidential U.S. diplomatic cables, causing embarrassment to the government and others. It also has published hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. documents relating to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Assange sought refuge at the embassy five days after the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom dismissed a bid to reopen his appeal of the decision to send him to Sweden \u2013 his last option in British courts. It is unclear when Ecuador will make a decision on Assange\u2019s asylum request."

Van Gaal will be taking charge of the Oranje for the second time, having had a previous 14-game tenure at the turn of the century. \u201cVan Gaal has signed a contract that will link him from August 1 this year until the end of the World Cup in 2014,\u201d a statement on the official Dutch football federation (KNVB) website read. Van Marwijk, who steered the Netherlands to the final of the 2010 World Cup, departed after their exit at the group stages of the European championships in Poland and Ukraine. They lost all three of their matches. A number of men were linked with the job, including other former national coaches in Frank Rijkaard and Guus Hiddink, but the KNVB opted for the 60-year-old van Gaal. \u201cWe were looking for a trainer with a wealth of experience, with personal  and technical expertise,\u201d said KNVB director Bert van Oostveen. \u201cVan Gaal earned his spurs not only nationally, but internationally as well and we know him as a dedicated and highly driven coach,\u201d van Oostveen added. Van Gaal has been out of the game since being sacked by Bayern Munich last year, having led them to the Champions League final in 2010. He has also had spells at Catalan giants Barcelona and Ajax Amsterdam, where he forged his reputation by leading them to a hat-trick of Dutch league titles from 1994-1996 and the European Champions League in 1995. \u201cIt\u2019s the challenge I have been waiting for,\u201d said van Gaal as he gave his reaction on the official website. In his previous spell in charge he succeeded Rijkaard in 2000 and took the national team to 12 wins from 14 games. But he resigned in 2001 when they failed to qualify for the final of the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan. Van Gaal will be looking to correct that in qualifying for the next World Cup in Brazil in 2014. Raymond Verheijen, a former member of the Dutch national coaching staff, gave his reaction on Twitter to the appointment. \u201cHopefully, the Dutch FA have analyzed both the current/future Dutch squad & the style of Van Gaal before they decided to go for this option,\u201d he tweeted. Van Gaal has established a reputation for tactical acumen and his ability to rebuild teams, but has a forthright approach and an often frosty approach to the media. He has appointed former Ajax star Danny Blind as his assistant. "

I  wasn\u2019t really happy with the way the bike was feeling in the turns but in the  end we ended up with pole position.\u201d The tricky conditions led to a number of crashes, with Hector Barbera the most notable casualty, although without serious injury. Italian ace Valentino Rossi again struggled on his Ducati and was back in ninth spot, while San Carlo Honda Gresini\u2019s Alvaro Bautista will start from the back of the grid after being penalized for his crash last weekend at Assen where he took out Lorenzo on the first bend.

        "content": "The Rev. Sally Foster-Fulton doesn\u2019t expect worshippers at Dunblane Cathedral to tarry at the close of the second service Sunday. By then, their minds will have shifted from tithing to tennis in anticipation of local hero Andy Murray\u2019s bid to win the Wimbledon men\u2019s title. Murray, 25, is the first British man to reach the finals since 1938. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge deal and everybody is over the moon,\u201d said Foster-Fulton, associate minister at the Scottish city\u2019s landmark cathedral.  Murray, who reached the final with a grueling win Friday over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, will play six-time champion Roger Federer. Dunblane, primarily known for its cathedral and picturesque river, Allan Water, is bursting with obvious pride. \u201cThis is one of the things in my town (I wanted) to see before I die,\u201d said Tom McLean, owner of the Dunblane Hotel. \u201cI wanted to see a British person to go to the finals of Wimbledon. It is double special because he is Scot.\u201d As he did Friday, McLean will serve strawberries and cream to customers who will pack the hotel\u2019s large bar. The dish is a Wimbledon tradition. \u201cWe\u2019re going to party like you wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d McLean said. He\u2019s also holding something special in reserve for Sunday. \u201cWhen (Murray) strikes the winning ball, we will strike open the champagne and the party begins.\u201d Part bedroom community, the city of nearly 12,000 has grown because of its proximity to transportation corridors, said Foster-Fulton, a native of South Carolina married to a Scot. Many residents commute to Edinburgh, Perth and Glasgow for work. Dunblane is a bit off tourists\u2019 beaten path, but it does receive some visitors. \u201cIt remains a close-knit community with a great heart,\u201d the minister told CNN Friday after Murray won his semifinal match. That heart was nearly broken in 1996, when a former scout leader went on a rampage at a school, killing 16 young children, an adult and himself. Donations after the massacre led to the opening in 2004 of the Dunblane Centre, a multi-purpose community sports, leisure, arts, meeting and youth facility. The center is inviting residents to watch the Murray-Federer afternoon match on a big screen. \u201cThe community believes this is Andy\u2019s time,\u201d said Stewart Prodger, a trustee for the charity that oversees the center. Murray\u2019s success in tennis shows the town has moved forward since the 1996 tragedy, according to Prodger. \u201cWe are no less mindful about what happened in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are about celebrating the future. Andy is very much a part of Dunblane\u2019s success story.\u201d Relatively few people in the city were alive in 1938 when the last British player, Bunny Austin, played in the men\u2019s final, losing to American Don Budge. Fred Perry was the last Briton to win the singles title, in 1936. McLean, of the Dunblane Hotel, knows Murray\u2019s work will be cut out for him Sunday. \u201cAndy has beaten Federer lots of times, but Federer is the ice man,\u201d McLean said. \u201cHe is so cool. Andy is going to have to raise his game.\u201d Foster-Fulton watched some of Friday\u2019s match, but went grocery shopping when the match tightened. \u201cI couldn\u2019t cope,\u201d she said. Sunday morning, she will lead services at the cathedral, which is affiliated with the Church of Scotland. Asked whether there will be any sports-centered supplications, the minister said, \u201cQuiet ones, anyway. It\u2019s tempting.\u201d"

        "content": "Home hope Andy Murray will play six-time champion Roger Federer in the Wimbledon final as both made tennis history Friday.  Murray became the first British man to reach the final in 74 years after seeing off Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 7-5 in the second semifinal.   Bunny Austin was the last home player to achieve the feat in 1938. Earlier Friday, Federer beat top seed and defending champion Novak Djokovic in four sets to reach a record eighth final. If Federer claims the title Sunday he will equal the record of seven for the Open Era, held by American great Pete Sampras and extend his grand slam tally to 17. Victory for fourth seed Murray would give Britain its first male grand slam winner since the legendary Fred Perry in 1936. He had to battle for nearly three hours on Centre Court before ending the brave challenge of fifth seed Tsonga, who mounted a sterling recovery after trailing by two sets. But the 25-year-old Murray finally worked two match points as he led 6-5 in the fourth set and dramatically took his chance.  A forehand winner was initially called out, but Murray challenged the decision and was proved to be right, sealing his victory. An emotional Murray hugged Tsonga before moving into the middle of the court to give his trademark \u201cfingers-in-the-air\u201d gesture, the tearful Scot looking to the sky. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of relief, excitement. It\u2019s tough to explain, it was such a close match,\u201d Murray told BBC Sport. \u201cBoth of us had chances, I was up a break, he came back, then he had break points at 4-4 in the fourth and I managed to hang tough enough,\u201d he added.  Federer had rolled back the years to dispatch world number one Djokovic 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 in just two hours 19 minutes. \u201cObviously I\u2019m ecstatic, it was a great match and I was able to play some fantastic tennis,\u201d Federer told BBC Sport after his victory. The 30-year-old Federer had never lost a semifinal at Wimbledon and maintained that streak with a peerless performance against the Serbian, who has dominated the men\u2019s game since the start of last year. After the opening two sets were shared, the third set proved pivotal with both men having chances to break their opponent\u2019s service. At 4-5 down, Djokovic allowed Federer a set point which he took after a thrilling exchange to take a two sets to one lead. \u201cThe first two sets went really quickly and the third was key to the match.  \u201cI was able to step it up and get a bit lucky maybe,\u201d Federer added. A single break in the fourth set was enough to leave the third seed to serve for his place in the final and he completed victory on his first match point. Federer has not won a grand slam title for two and a half years since his 2010 Australian Open success where he beat Murray in the final. If he beats the Scot again Sunday he will also return to the top spot in the world rankings.    "

        "content": "It can be argued that the biggest star of the Formula One season so far is not one of the six world champion drivers on the grid, it\u2019s not one of the legendary teams taking part \u2013 it\u2019s not even one of their design geniuses. The biggest talking point this year is the humble tire. Not because it has extraordinary qualities never seen before in motorsport rubber; quite the opposite, in fact. Sole supplier Pirelli has purposefully provided product that breaks down quicker than ever. Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher told CNN they are \u201clike driving on raw eggs.\u201d  The result has been seven different winners in eight races as drivers struggle to find the best way to conserve their allocation. \u201cOne of the key points of the season is that Pirelli has been very aggressive and made tires to wear that much during a race,\u201d the Italian company\u2019s test driver Lucas di Grassi told CNN.   \u201cWhen you decrease this grip level, when you decrease this contact by wearing the tire a lot, you cannot put the power down, you cannot brake, you cannot corner efficiently enough and you lose performance.   \u201cIt has been difficult for the teams to find the best strategy, and that has been key to all the overtakings and the excitement of the races.\u201d Pirelli chief backs tire critic Schumacher  Di Grassi gave CNN an insiders\u2019 look into Pirelli\u2019s tires ahead of this weekend\u2019s British Grand Prix at Silverstone. \u201cIt has very little to do with a road car tire, actually,\u201d said the Brazilian, who had one season in F1 with the former Virgin Racing team (now known as Marussia) in 2010.   \u201cThis tire is made to produce an enormous amount of grip, five times more than a road car and to last much less.  A road car can last for 30,000 kilometers and an F1 race is only 300.  This tire is made to last between 100 and 150 km.\u201d Schumacher is struggling to restore the dominance he had at Ferrari when Bridgestone dominated the F1 tire scene, though the 43-year-old German\u2019s third-placing in Valencia last month suggests he is finally learning to manage the rubber. Vettel offers support to under-fire Pirelli Meanwhile, other lesser-known drivers are taking the chance to make their name on the circuit. Schumacher\u2019s Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg claimed his first career win in China, Williams\u2019 Pastor Maldonado did the same at the Spanish Grand Prix, while Sauber\u2019s Sergio Perez and Romain Grosjean of Lotus have earned their first podium placings. Former world champion Kimi Raikkonen has proven quick to adapt on his return to F1, but the driver who has taken the best advantage of the situation is Fernando Alonso. Faced with the prospect of a season struggling to compete in an ill-equipped Ferrari, the two-time titleholder has stunned experts by moving to the top of the standings with two wins and two other podiums while never finishing outside the top 10. F1 legend: Pirelli tires are dangerous \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what makes the difference between a world champion and a common racer,\u201d Di Grassi said.   \u201cYou can see that Alonso has done an amazing job to understand the tires from the beginning of the season until now. \u201cFor a racing driver one of the most difficult things is to get the most grip out of the tire because you have to feel it, actually have to feel that corner before you arrive there, you actually have to feel that brake so you know how much speed you can carry \u2013 and that\u2019s totally dependent on the tire performance.    \u201cAnd on the other hand it is very difficult for you to understand how to go as fast as possible but also preserve the tire, sometimes to drive at 90-95% to extend the life of the tire.\u201d Should Formula One be so unpredictable? Pirelli returned to F1 as sole tire supplier in 2011 in a three-year deal after Bridgestone ended its involvement in the elite division of motorsport. Its head of motorsport Paul Hembery admits there was a conscious decision to put tires in the limelight. \u201cWe always have a tough job getting people to talk about tires. In a competition situation, battling another manufacturer, when you\u2019re winning no-one talks about you, but if you\u2019re losing you can be sure people will blame it on the tires!\u201d he said in an interview with the magazine of the Caterham F1 team, which CNN sponsors. \u201cIn a control tire situation, such as we have, unless you\u2019re having issues with safety they don\u2019t get talked about at all. This was our way to try to become a discussion point of the weekend. It helps justify the investment you make in the sport.\u201d Hembery said that, even without the Pirelli factor, the 12 competing teams are a lot closer in performance this year. \u201cIn past seasons we have seen some cars, even at the front, having maybe a half-a-second to a second advantage over the next cars. This year that gap covers 15 or 16 cars. That we didn\u2019t foresee,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt\u2019s obviously very interesting to see so many cars in the mix. It\u2019s good that we\u2019re not sitting here with a third of the season over knowing who\u2019s going to win the championship.\u201d Caterham\u2019s drivers Heikki Kovalainen and Vitaly Petrov have yet to register a point this season, but the UK-based team\u2019s technical director Mark Smith has been enjoying the challenge. \u201cIt provides an opportunity for us \u2013 on a given day, on a given circuit, in the right ambient conditions \u2013 to perform a little bit beyond where we are expected to perform,\u201d Smith said. So what can the drivers expect at Silverstone for Saturday\u2019s qualifying and the race on Sunday? \u201cIt is one of the fastest tracks of the season and this means for the tires, a very high energy load, cornering, braking and acceleration,\u201d Di Grassi said. \u201cMy top two tips are: use the soft compound for qualifying for optimum grip and best performance; and for the race, mix between the hard and the soft, also saving the tires as best they can, and attack at the right time.\u201d"

        "content": "McLaren\u2019s Lewis Hamilton set the pace in Friday practice ahead of his home British Grand Prix, on a day which saw heavy rain batter the Silverstone track and left organizers with a big headache. Hamilton\u2019s lap on one minute 56.345 seconds in the afternoon session was 0.129 seconds faster than that of Sauber\u2019s Kamui Kobayashi, after Romain Grosjean of Lotus went fastest in the morning. \u201cI had some fun out there today,\u201d the 27-year-old said in a McLaren statement. \u201cI got to do a good few laps too, which was good, because I was concerned that the fans wouldn\u2019t get to see much action.   \u201cThere were so many of them out there today. I can\u2019t remember seeing so many people at a racetrack on a Friday before \u2013 it was incredible. British Formula One fans are the best in the world. \u201cI would like to have gone out and done even more laps \u2013 but we simply didn\u2019t have enough tires to do that. Perhaps that\u2019s something we can look at for the future.\u201d But those fans were told to stay away from the famous circuit Saturday if they had been planning to use public car parks. The downpours have left these areas flooded and Silverstone managing director Richard Phillips gave this warning. \u201cTomorrow there will be 20,000 to 30,000 people we won\u2019t be able to properly cater for.   \u201cIt\u2019s going to cost us a lot of money.   \u201cI unreservedly apologize to people. I feel very responsible for it, this is something I\u2019ve been very proud of over the years and I almost could cry now.\u201d Tires take center stage in Formula One Over 40 millimeters of rain has fallen in 12 hours and made conditions treacherous for the drivers, with Bruno Senna smashing into the wall after losing control of his Williams midway through the second session. Two-time world champion and current title leader Fernando Alonso also lost his front wing after clipping the barriers. \u201cUnfortunately we didn\u2019t have a very productive day in the end,\u201d the 28-year-old Senna said in a Williams press release.  \u201cThe weather was poor weather with puddles on the track during second practice. On my second run, I aquaplaned on some deep water at the high speed Becketts section of the track and from that point I was a passenger until the car hit the wall.   \u201cIt was quite a heavy accident but I am ok. There is a lot of damage to the car but the Williams team will, I\u2019m sure, do a great job of getting it back into shape for tomorrow (Saturday).\u201d Red Bull\u2019s reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel, currently fourth in the 2012 standings, bemoaned the wet conditions.  Regulations limiting the number of wet and intermediate tires teams can use combined with the weather meant most of the action was restricted to the second half of the afternoon session. \u201cIf there\u2019s too much standing water on track we can\u2019t go out, as we aquaplane pretty quickly,\u201d Vettel, who finished second in last year\u2019s race, told the sport\u2019s official website.  \u201cI think Senna went off and it shows how quickly it can happen. It\u2019s a real shame for the fans sitting in the grandstands waiting for the cars to come out. I feel for them.  \u201cWe got in a bit of running in the end, but for us it\u2019s not so useful, as you can\u2019t really try anything in these conditions. I think weather will be the most important factor in determining the rest of the weekend.\u201d The teams will return to the track for practice and final qualifying Saturday ahead of Sunday\u2019s ninth grand prix of the year.

        "content": "For 50 years one spy has outfoxed, outgunned, and outdressed every villain thrown his way. His name? Bond \u2026 James Bond.  Now a new 007 exhibition in London is celebrating the half century since the world\u2019s most famous secret agent first appeared on screen. It was 1962 when Sean Connery\u2019s Bond defeated Dr. No and floated off into the sunset with Honey Ryder. Today the first Bond Girl\u2019s bikini is one of more than 400 items on display in an exhibition tracing the design of the one of the world\u2019s most profitable film franchises. From Scaramanga\u2019s golden gun to Daniel Craig\u2019s tiny trunks in the 2006 remake of \u201cCasino Royale,\u201d the Barbican Centre exhibition in London allows fans to follow in 007\u2019s footsteps on a journey from 1962 up through Bond\u2019s golden anniversary ahead of \u201cSkyfall\u201d, which is due to be released in October. \u201cAdventure films have come and gone, but James Bond has remained a huge box office draw throughout,\u201d exhibition co-curator Bronwyn Cosgrave told CNN. \u201cAnd he\u2019s also the best-dressed man in cinema history.\u201d James Bond\u2019s \u2018Quantum of Solace\u2019 speedboat is show\u2019s star turn Fans are greeted at the gallery\u2019s exhibition by a waxwork of Sean Connery leaning against a replica of Bond\u2019s famous 1964 Aston Martin DB5 car.  From there, a bullet-shaped entry way leads through to the Gold Room, which features a life-sized recreation of character Jill Masterson\u2019s death by gold paint from the 1964 film \u201cGoldfinger.\u201d \u201cShirley Eaton\u2019s golden body is one of the most iconic Bond images, and we went to great lengths to cast a form \u2013 not just a mannequin \u2013 to painstakingly make a body that resembled her nubile proportions from Goldfinger,\u201d Cosgrave said. The exhibition\u2019s narrative arc is formulated much like a Bond film: visitors pass through M\u2019s office, where Britain\u2019s top spy received his mission orders, to Q Branch, where he picked up his latest gadgets. A montage of the casino scenes from every Bond film play on the walls of the casino room before visitors take a trip through the \u201creal, fictional, and otherworldly\u201d exotic locations of 007\u2019s many adventures. Idris Elba: I\u2019d consider playing James Bond The exhibition also traces the evolution of Bond\u2019s formidable wardrobe, from Connery\u2019s Savile Row-made tuxedos to Pierce Brosnan\u2019s Brioni suits, and showcases a number of Bond Girl dresses, including Halle Berry\u2019s Versace dress from \u201cDie Another Day.\u201d Cosgrave and her colleagues dug deep into the 007 archive in order to find pieces that evoke design in Bond films. \u201cThis is the only exhibition where Bond is a supporting character \u2013 equally iconic are the sets, the gadgets, and the costumes,\u201d she said.  The costumes are remarkable, but at the end of the day Bond is a man of action \u2013 which is why the exhibition\u2019s grand finale culminates in the Ice Palace from \u201cDie Another Day,\u201d where visitors are surrounded with footage of 007\u2019s many chase scenes in the snow.  The exhibition ends where many of the spy\u2019s adventures began: at the bar with a martini \u2013 shaken, not stirred, obviously \u2013 in classic Bond fashion. New James Bond \u2018GoldenEye\u2019 game debuts"

        "content": "Nigel Mansell called it people power, others just call it home advantage. Andy Murray at Wimbledon, Wayne Rooney at Old Trafford and \u2013 this weekend \u2013 Lewis Hamilton, Jenson Button and Paul di Resta at Silverstone: they have the crowd behind them, they can hear the cheers from the stands, see the caps, banners and flags bearing their names. Mansell was so popular with (most of) the British public that he even started his own movement, \u201cMansell Mania,\u201d which peaked at Silverstone in 1987.  \u201cOur Nige\u201d \u2013 never one to let an ailment or problem go unnoticed \u2013 was suffering from a severe wheel vibration by lap 12. \u2018Last dinosaur\u2019 or F1\u2019s brainiest man? It only got worse and soon he was running five seconds behind teammate Nelson Piquet. The Williams team wasn\u2019t planning to do any pit stops, but Mansell dived in to change the offending wheel. He emerged 29 seconds off the lead.  The fans were distraught \u2013 there wouldn\u2019t be a repeat performance of Mansell\u2019s win the year before at Brands Hatch \u2013 but he was suddenly flying.  \u201cI think I broke the lap record 11 times in the last 15 laps,\u201d he said at the time. He was soon up on the back of Piquet and sold a dummy that Cristiano Ronaldo would have been proud of with only two laps to go.  Tires take center stage in F1 His second \u2013 of four \u2013 British Grand Prix wins was complete. The crowd went mad and surged onto the track, so Mansell had to come to a grinding halt on his slowing down lap to avoid running any of them over.  Mansell always believed the fans gave him extra power, that extra quarter of a second a lap. It may seem ridiculous, but four of his 31 Formula One wins came on home turf in front of one of the most passionate crowds in the world.  Okay, not much comes close to the tifosi at Monza, bedecked in Prancing Horses, but Silverstone is up there. Of course, not everyone shares the same view. British motorbike rider Cal Crutchlow looked a little bemused when posed the question of whether the fans gave him \u201cextra power\u201d ahead of his MotoGP race at Silverstone on June 17 this year.  \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2026 What? Like Uri Geller with his spoon? If he really thinks about it, it bends\u2026\u201d he said smiling.  Injured female F1 driver\u2019s family touched by support \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, hopefully all the fans can all sit in the stands on the weekend and think that I can have a podium or something like that and it might happen.  \u201cBut seriously you have to treat it like it\u2019s any other race when you\u2019re on the track.\u201d  Two days after this he went out and broke his ankle in practice. Come race day he started at the back of the grid \u2013 with said broken ankle \u2013 and stormed through the field to finish an incredible sixth, overtaking Ducati\u2019s former world champion Nicky Hayden on the last lap.  So what of the modern F1 drivers? It doesn\u2019t make for great reading if you\u2019re Button/Hamilton/di Resta and hoping for a win this weekend in front of the 100,000-strong crowd.  Sebastian Vettel \u2013 0 German Grand Prix wins. Mark Webber \u2013 0 Australian Grand Prix wins. Button \u2013 0 British Grand Prix wins. Hamilton \u2013 one British Grand Prix win. Fernando Alonso \u2013 one Spanish Grand Prix win (and one win in the European Grand Prix in Valencia this year, which took him to the top of the championship standings).  The only man to have serious success on home soil is Michael Schumacher with four German Grand Prix wins, behind only compatriot Rudolf Caracciola \u2013 who won it six times between 1926-39.  But seven-time world champion Schumacher has won a record 91 grands prix and it\u2019s no surprise the 43-year-old managed four of those at Hockenheim, plus five victories when the European Grand Prix was held at the Nurburgring. However, he has finished ninth and eighth at the German GP since returning from retirement with Mercedes. This weekend most people\u2019s money is on Vettel. Before his Red Bull gave way in the last race, he was streets ahead in Valencia. No way anyone was going to catch him.  Alonso may have won fantastically in front of his home crowd, but he was cautious afterwards. \u201cRed Bull is fast\u201d echoed round the paddock. McLaren, though, has been throwing the kitchen sink, and many millions, at its 2012 challenger in order to close the gap.  And with the unpredictability this season has produced there\u2019s no need to write off either Button \u2013 who has always been dogged by bad luck in his home grand prix \u2013 or his fellow former world champion Hamilton.  Also, there\u2019s always that home advantage, but maybe that\u2019s just a load of rubbish? We\u2019ll see for ourselves on Sunday.  "

        "content": "Maria de Villota\u2019s family have expressed their thanks for the public support they have received after the Marussia driver lost her right eye following a Formula One crash. The Spaniard, one of only two female drivers contracted to an F1 team, sustained serious head and face injuries when her car collided with a stationary truck during a test event on Tuesday. De Villota underwent surgery at a British hospital following the incident, but it was too late to save the 32-year-old\u2019s eye. \u201cLast dinosaur\u201d or F1\u2019s brainiest man?  \u201cWe, the family, are supporting each other here at Maria\u2019s side and we take great comfort from the remarkable medical care she has been receiving,\u201d her sister Isabel said in a statement released by the Russian-owned team. \u201cWe remain positive and this is due, in no small part, to the overwhelming expression of love and support for Maria from every corner of the world.  \u201cWe would also wish to thank everyone at the Marussia F1 Team for all the care and attention they have shown us over the past few days.\u201d Tuesday was the first time De Villota had been behind the wheel of Marussia\u2019s MR01 car, although she did conduct a test for the Renault team last year. \u201cMaria remains in a critical but stable condition,\u201d added De Villota\u2019s sister. \u201cWhile there is no further news than that at present, we have at least been able to take encouragement from the fact that Maria has remained stable throughout since the accident, particularly during the first night following such a lengthy surgical procedure as she experienced.\u201d The De Villota family has a rich motorsport heritage. Maria\u2019s father Emilio was a Formula One driver between 1976 and 1982. The only other female driver currently involved in the elite division of motorsport is Susie Wolff, who is a development driver with Williams. "

        "content": "Wimbledon holds a special place in the tennis calendar, an elegant tournament rich with tradition, style and sporting majesty. The modern era of the men\u2019s game there has been defined by the legacy of Pete Sampras, who won a record seven titles in eight years. However, it was not exactly love at first sight for the confident young American, who \u2013 despite winning his first grand slam at the age of 19 \u2013 suffered early exits in his first three visits to the famous grass-court venue.  \u201cI didn\u2019t like grass at all and when people ask me about grass and when I first went over there, I tell them I hated Wimbledon. I hated the surface,\u201d he told CNN.  Calendar of the court: The six seasons of the tennis year But, speaking to Open Court\u2019s Pat Cash, a fellow Wimbledon champion, Sampras quickly qualified his remarks. \u201cI loved Wimbledon and what it meant, but the surface felt uncomfortable.  I just didn\u2019t like it, I was a hard-court guy, a Californian kid. \u201cOn hard courts the ball is going to be just there, but with grass  you have to adjust, so the first two, three years I had to adjust and came out with a bad attitude.\u201d Sampras paid tribute to his former coach Tim Gullikson, who tragically lost his life to brain cancer in 1996. The \u2018owner\u2019 of Wimbledon \u201cHe helped me. I had these long swings, and he shortened them up and told me my attitude had to be more positive at Wimbledon,\u201d the 40-year-old recalled. The fruits of their labors came in 1992 when Sampras advanced to the semifinals before being beaten by big-serving Croatian Goran Ivanisevic, who subsequently lost to Andre Agassi in the final .  Success was just around the corner the following year. \u201cMentally I felt better. By \u201992 I felt really comfortable, I was the owner of the place for the next seven years.\u201d Only a quarterfinal defeat to eventual winner Richard Kracijek in 1996 interrupted an incredible run which saw Sampras claim seven of the next eight Wimbledon crowns. His 1999 victory in the final over Agassi in straight sets was rated one of his best performances as he demolished his arch-rival. \u201cThat sixth Wimbledon (title) against Andre I got in the zone,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt if I was serving well, I would do well, get into the net, be aggressive. It was bit more high risk, I was okay with that.\u201d In 2001, Sampras was beaten in the fourth round by a youthful Roger Federer as he sought an eighth Wimbledon title, and he retired the following year after winning the U.S. Open in fairytale fashion. He is still involved in tennis and plays the occasional exhibition or seniors Champions Tour event, but spends most of his time with his wife Bridgette Wilson and their two children at his home in California. Federer domination Federer began his era of domination in 2003, but the 16-time grand slam champion is still one short of the Wimbledon record held by Sampras \u2013 whose tally is matched only by the seven won by Britain\u2019s William Renshaw in the tournament\u2019s formative years of the 1880s. Sampras believes that the Swiss maestro can still claim another, but he may struggle with world No. 1 Novak Djokovic \u2013 who he was to face in Friday\u2019s semifinals \u2013 and Rafael Nadal in their prime. \u201cRoger needs to find a way to be creative, stick to his game and serve and volley now and again,\u201d Sampras said. \u201cHe\u2019s won 16 majors in a  certain way, he\u2019s not going to change now.\u201d The task of giving Federer advice falls to his current coach Paul Annacone, who also guided Sampras in the latter part of his career. The American acknowledges the difference in their playing styles but told CNN that both shared a key ingredient to success. \u201cBoth these guys are superstars in regards to handling pressure,\u201d Annacone said. Sampras accepts that his style of big serving and volleying at Wimbledon is from a bygone era, and he regrets its passing. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see Wimbledon today with the players staying back, with the balls being different, but grass is grass \u2013 you can still get into the net but it\u2019s a lost art, and it\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d"

        "content": "Armed  police shut down a busy motorway in central England Thursday amid a security alert centred on a bus, a stark reminder of the heightened watch being maintained by authorities just three weeks before the London Olympic Games. Hours earlier, police in London arrested six people on terror charges but said the operation was unrelated to the Olympics, which begin in late July. While police concluded that the incident on the bus presented no threat, terror-related or otherwise, security is a central concern for UK authorities and Olympic organizers ahead of the games. CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson explains what\u2019s behind Thursday\u2019s police operations.  What does the police response to the bus incident mean? What this tells us is that while this incident was completely unrelated to the Olympics, the counter-terrorism authorities and police are ready on a hair-trigger to respond in an incredibly fast, positive and organized way to any perceived security threats.  Thursday\u2019s events are symptomatic of the police preparing and raising their level of concern about people who may be plotting events related to the Olympics. We saw the police in London arrest six people on Thursday \u2013 although they say it\u2019s not related to the Olympics, they say it\u2019s related to credible threats against sites in the United Kingdom.  What we are seeing in the lead-up to the Olympics is the police and intelligence authorities taking absolutely no chances.   Security during the Olympics will be at an all-time high. Has that operation already begun?  Olympic security has already begun. The police, the army and the hazardous materials people were ready on a hair-trigger, and they will already be analyzing how quickly the response times were for today\u2019s incident. And they will have units around London that are ready to move that quickly.  When you see the arrests Thursday, the arrests last week and even the arrest of two men from ETA (Basque separatist group) last week in London, it gives the impression that anything going on out there, any group the police are aware of\u2026 they\u2019re taking no chances and they\u2019re just wrapping everyone up.  What can people expect when they come to London for the Olympics?  I think you can expect to be thoroughly searched entering the Olympic site. You can expect to see a much greater security presence on the streets \u2013 we were already told by one person who advises the government on defense and terrorism issues that the increased helicopter activity we\u2019re seeing now in London is just so people get used to the fact there are going to be more military helicopters flying around during the Olympics, and I think we\u2019re going to see more of that type of activity.   We\u2019re already seeing more police in uniform around the city. Witness the arrests, and the things we\u2019re aware the police have been doing the past couple of weeks, and it\u2019s clear the Olympic level security is already underway.  Is there a risk of civil liberties being infringed?  It\u2019s safe to say that at times like this you can assume that the police and intelligence authorities won\u2019t be taking any chances. There may be civil liberties advocates who will complain in hindsight \u2013 but the British government has said recently that it has an obligation to provide security during the Olympics. At the end of the day, if you\u2019re a police officer you can\u2019t afford to take any risks.  What other options are police considering to prevent attacks?  The police are looking at people who have been in jail on terrorist convictions who are still considered a danger and are out on license [probation] \u2013 they\u2019re looking at ways to make sure they can not pose a threat, make sure they is no reason to put them back in jail for example. In the past 18 months, between 50 and 80 terror convicts have been released from prison, and many of them are in east London, where the bulk of the Olympics will be held. So the police are considering what they can do with the people who\u2019ve been released on license who they consider dangerous.   One thing they\u2019re considering is finding ways to make sure these people are not on the streets of London for the period of the Olympics. That\u2019s not something the police are making public, and it\u2019s not something that has necessarily happened, it\u2019s just something that\u2019s under serious consideration, which gives you an idea of how sensitive the police are about stopping any sort of incident around the Olympics. What else are police worried about?  There are about 8,000 Muslims in the prison population, and the probation service estimates that approximately one in 10 Muslims in prison is being radicalized \u2013 and the number\u2019s probably higher than that.   Every terror convict who\u2019s been to jail has been seen as a hero by certain aspects of their community, and while they may not commit another terror act, they will attract what are known as \u201cclean skins\u201d  \u2013 people who have no past terror convictions. So you have this problem where Muslims who are radicalized in jail come out and become magnets who radicalize kids in their neighborhoods, and that is a very real threat.  The other threat is from people like the Real IRA (Irish Republican Army) \u2013 unlike al Qaeda, the Real IRA are actually building 400-lb bombs, and these bombs are getting caught and intercepted due to intelligence operations.  There\u2019s a concern that the Real IRA is getting much more sophisticated than they used to be \u2013 the sophistication of their improvised explosive devices are getting much better, and we\u2019ve heard that from a number of sources. While the Real IRA probably wouldn\u2019t want to attack the Olympics as much as a group like al Qaeda would, they\u2019re actually building big bombs in cars that are more sophisticated than what al Qaeda cells in London are capable of.

        "content": "Seven men have been arrested in the United Kingdom on suspicion of terror offenses, West Midlands police said Friday. The arrests on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday followed the discovery of two guns and a small amount of ammunition hidden in a car stopped by police last weekend who believed it was uninsured, the police said. The news comes as Britain is in a state of heightened security ahead of the London Olympics, which open in three weeks. On Thursday, armed police in Staffordshire closed a major highway and called in bomb disposal squads when a passenger on a bus raised the alarm over smoke coming from a fellow traveler\u2019s bag. The source turned out to be a quit-smoking aid, and no arrests were made. Police in London also arrested six people Thursday on suspicion of committing, planning or instigating terror offenses. Those arrests were not related to the Olympic or Paralympic Games, police said. The arrests announced Friday involve six men from the West Midlands, all in their 20s, and a 43-year-old man from West Yorkshire. Is Olympic-level security already under way in Britain? The seven men have been detained on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, a police statement said. Detective Chief Supt. Kenny Bell of the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit said: \u201cAs soon as the items were discovered in the impounded vehicle, our priority was to protect the public by pursuing and arresting those we believed to be involved.\u201d The firearms, which were not loaded when they were found, are being tested, and police are searching a number of addresses, the statement said. No information has yet been given on the motivation of the suspects. However, it is understood that the individuals arrested in the West Midlands and West Yorkshire were not targeting the Olympics, nor did they have any links to those arrested Thursday in London.  Following these arrests the UK Home Office website has not changed the terror threat level from \u201csubstantial,\u201d which is the third highest of five levels. The next level up is \u201csevere,\u201d which means an attack is \u201chighly likely,\u201d and the highest is \u201ccritical,\u201d meaning an attack is \u201cexpected imminently.\u201d Additional security measures will be in place in London and elsewhere during the Olympics. They include the siting of missile defense systems around the capital and fighter jets on standby at air bases close to London. Police and intelligence agencies have also stepped up monitoring efforts. Government officials from Washington to London insist there are no known specific or credible terror threats tied to the Olympics. Nonetheless, authorities on both sides of the Atlantic are urging vigilance. The Metropolitan Police is leading the \u201clargest peacetime operation\u201d seen in the United Kingdom as it seeks to keep the public safe, it said, with up to 9,500 police officers from London and elsewhere to be deployed on the busiest days of the Olympics. As a result, London\u2019s residents and its visitors can expect to see a large police presence on the streets and airport-style security at Olympic venues. The driver of the bus caught up in Thursday\u2019s terror alert on the M6 Toll motorway was praised by his company, Megabus, in a statement Friday for his \u201ccalm and professional\u201d response to the incident. \u201cIt was a scary thing for a lot of people and it was a very long and tiring day,\u201d the driver is quoted as saying. \u201cWe were all in it together and when you\u2019re faced with armed police you can\u2019t really do anything else other than follow their instructions.\u201d Bus scare, terror arrests ramp up UK security concerns ahead of Olympics "

        "content": "Romania\u2019s president Traian Basescu was suspended on Friday, after the impeachment motion filed by the ruling coalition passed the Parliament\u2019s vote.  Romania\u2019s coalition of Social Democrats and Liberals argued their action by saying that President Traian Basescu has breached the Constitution and overstepped his authority.  The motion passed with 256 votes, 39 more than the minimum required. The country is expected to hold a referendum on July 29, when Romanians will have to vote whether they want Basescu to remain in office.  During the suspension, National Liberal Party leader Crin Antonescu, who is also the president of the Senate, will assume the interim presidency. Earlier this week, Antonescu was appointed the president of the Senate. This position allows him to assume the president\u2019s attributions, in case the latter is suspended, according to the Constitution.   Crin Antonescu said on Friday he is ready to step out of politics if Basescu wins the referendum.    During his speech in parliament, before the vote, Basescu accused the ruling coalition of taking control of the country\u2019s judicial system and public institutions.  He also expressed concern about the country\u2019s state of law and said this political turmoil will have long-term negative impacts on Romania. \u201cTake care of the country!\u201d Basescu said at the end of his speech. It is the second time Basescu has faced suspension since he took the power, eight years ago. The first time was in 2007, after which he won a referendum and returned to office.  Earlier on Friday, Romania\u2019s Constitutional Court gave an ambiguous statement regarding the constitutional status of this impeachment motion. The judges approved some of the points from the motion, but they didn\u2019t make it clear whether Basescu has violated the Constitution or not. In any case, the Court played an advisory role this time, leaving the final word to the Parliament. The court issued a statement saying that one of its judges, Aspazia Cojocaru, received threats prior to court debates on the impeachment motion.  The political developments sparked controversy in the international community. On Friday, the European Commission expressed concern about the country\u2019s political turmoil, \u201cespecially regarding actions that appear to reduce the effective powers of independent institutions like the Constitutional Court.\u201d  The Commission\u2019s President Jose Manuel Barosso invited Romanian Prime Minister Ponta to Brussels next week to hold talks regarding the country\u2019s political developments.  This after Ponta was accused of trying to dismantle the Constitutional Court by changing some of its judges. U.S. Ambassador to Romania Mark Gitenstein, said he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that the independence of the country\u2019s democratic institutions was under threat. In the meantime, hundreds of people protested on Friday, expressing their concern about the country\u2019s political crisis. While some Romanians believe the government is not respecting the rule of law and democratic principles, others expressed their support for the ruling coalition and called for Basescu to step down.  Earlier this week Romania\u2019s Parliament passed a law making it easier to impeach Basescu, a decision that sparked some controversy. In addition, the prime minister accused some Constitutional Court judges of political bias and incompatibility and suggested that they should be replaced. The ruling coalition this week sacked the heads of both chambers of Parliament, who were Basescu allies, and replaced them with politicians close to the prime minister. It also dismissed the country\u2019s ombudsman, whom it accused of political bias. The newly appointed ombudsman, Valer Dorneanu, is a former Social Democrat member of Parliament. Basescu\u2019s suspension is the latest in a series of attacks between the prime minister and the president. The two men also argued over who was entitled to represent Romania at last month\u2019s meeting of the European Council in Brussels. Ponta received parliament\u2019s vote to go to Brussels on behalf of the country, but the Constitutional Court ruled the president had the right to attend the event. In the end, the prime minister ignored the court\u2019s ruling and traveled to Brussels.  Romania\u2019s government became the object of international criticism after the prime minister was accused of plagiarizing his doctoral thesis. Ponta dismissed the accusation as a political attack from Basescu. The country\u2019s political turmoil has dropped Romania\u2019s currency, Leu, to the lowest level in the last two weeks. "

        "content": "He overtook the legendary Jack Nicklaus\u2019 haul of tournament wins with victory at the AT&T National on Sunday but Tiger Woods will need a stellar weekend to lift his fourth PGA Tour title of 2012. The 14-time major winner opened with a disappointing one-over-par round of 71 at the Greenbrier Classic in West Virginia, an event he only added to his schedule last week. Woods, the former world No. 1, said he struggled to adjust to the speed of the greens at The Old White TPC course on Thursday, as he gears up for the year\u2019s third major \u2013 the British Open at Royal Lytham and St. Annes later this month. He was eight shots behind first-round leader Vijay Singh, and blamed his total of 31 putts for his display as he was tied for 88th in a big group of players including his old rival Phil Mickelson. \u201cI was a little bit off with my game, and on top of that I didn\u2019t have the speed of these greens at all,\u201d Woods told the official PGA Tour website. \u201cMy last three tournaments, the greens were awfully quick and they have a lot of swing at the end because of how fast they are. I missed literally every single putt high today.\u201d It is the first time Woods has played the tournament, and his four birdies were tempered by three bogeys and a double bogey. Despite his good form in 2012, Woods\u2019 last triumph in a major came at the U.S. Open in 2008. Since then his career stalled through injury and well-documented problems in his personal life. Woods\u2019 only practice round at the course came during Wednesday\u2019s pro-am but he refused to use that as an excuse, saying the course was set up to be attacked. \u201cIf you get the ball on the fairway you\u2019re going to have a lot of nine iron shots or under and you can attack this golf course,\u201d he added. \u201cMost scores are at least two under or better and most of the guys can be pretty aggressive here.\u201d Three-time major winner Singh carded four late birdies to shoot an opening round 63 and lead by one shot from Americans Jeff Maggert, Jonathan Byrd and Martin Flores. It was his lowest round since the 2008 Deutsche Bank Championship. \u201cGosh, I don\u2019t know where that came from,\u201d Singh said. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing pretty good golf for a while but just never got any scoring going. \u201cIt\u2019s my first good round of the year, I would say, that I felt really comfortable with. It\u2019s a good way to start a tournament. I\u2019m looking forward to the rest of the week.\u201d U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson also had a good Thursday, opening up with 65 to sit two shots behind Singh alongside Argentina\u2019s Andres Romero and South African Garth Mulroy. Woods\u2019 new stablemate, former top amateur Patrick Cantlay, was tied for 16th on 67 in his second professional start, one ahead of a big group including two-time major winner John Daly. On the European Tour, Sweden\u2019s Christian Nilsson shot a round of 65 to lead the Alstom Open de France after the first round at Le Golf National near Paris \u2013 Ryder Cup host in 2018. Nilsson leads by one shot from Italian teenager Matteo Manassero, England\u2019s Gary Boyd, and Thailand\u2019s Thongchai Jaidee who are all on five-under. World No. 3 Lee Westwood finished day one on one-under despite dropping four shots in the first six holes. The Englishman also played a shot on his final hole while standing in a lake after a wayward tee shot. British Open champion Darren Clarke also recorded a round of 70 but fellow Northern Irishman and 2010 U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell slumped to a round of one-over. Meanwhile, three Americans shared the lead after the first round of the U.S. Women\u2019s Open at Blackwolf Run in Kohler, Wisconsin. Cristie Kerr, Brittany Lincicome and Lizette Salas all shot three-under 69 to be a shot clear of teenage compatriot Lexi Thompson, Jennie Lee,  Japan\u2019s Ai Miyazato and and Spain\u2019s Beatriz Recari. World No. 1 Yani Tseng carded 74 to be tied for 38th in a group including defending champion  So Yeon Ryu of South Korea and American Michelle Wie. Tiger Woods\u2019 niece Cheyenne, who qualified for the tournament soon after turning professional, was tied for 55th on 75 in a group including Australia\u2019s former world No. 1 Karrie Webb \u2013 a two-time winner of the tournament."

        "content": "The American exploration vessel \u201cNautilus\u201d was supposed to begin broadcasting its undersea archeological and environmental exploration of the Black Sea July 7, according to the expedition\u2019s Facebook page. Instead, two days before the launch date, the ship was in Syrian territorial waters in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, assisting with the recovery of the bodies of two Turkish pilots killed when their reconnaissance jet was shot down by Syrian anti-aircraft defenses. The military search and recovery operation marked an unexpected change of course for a research expedition led by Robert Ballard, the undersea explorer who gained fame for discovering the wreckage of the Titanic in the Atlantic Ocean in the 1980s. Syria, Turkey spar over downed jet \u201cI think it was our luck that the Nautilus was already docked in Istanbul,\u201d said Selcuk Unal, a spokesman for Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry. \u201cIt had (previously) applied and been approved by our government to perform scientific research in the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea.\u201d Unal told CNN that after the Turkish Phantom RF-4 reconnaissance jet was shot down June 22, Turkish authorities recognized the need for resources capable of operating at extreme depths for the salvage operation. \u201cWhen this incident happened, we immediately looked into our resources, including the military and private sector,\u201d Unal said. But he added that few governments or corporations had submersibles capable of traveling to depths of more than 1,000 meters. The Nautilus, however, specializes in this type of work. \u201cE/V Nautilus is a 211-foot research vessel equipped with state-of-the-art exploration and telepresence technology,\u201d said a statement on the expedition\u2019s official website. \u201cOur rotating Corps of Exploration aboard Nautilus will be mapping the geological, biological, archaeological and chemical aspects of these regions to depths of approximately 2,000 meters.\u201d The website also said the Nautilus was equipped with several remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) that typically worked at extreme depths. \u201cWe started to talk to them,\u201d Unal explained.  \u201cThey were kind enough to postpone their scientific research for some time and join the search and rescue operation\u2026 they departed Istanbul immediately, and they arrived to the search and rescue area in two-and-a-half days.\u201d Opinion: Why do planes still crash? The Turkish military already had a number of vessels and aircraft operating in the crash zone, an area within Syrian territorial waters.  But the operation was tense; Turkish officials said Syrian defenses opened fire on a second Turkish plane that was brought in after the Phantom RF-4 was initially shot down. Turkish officials say the Nautilus is effectively under Turkish military command while participating in the recovery operation. \u201cWe can\u2019t risk anything,\u201d Unal said.  \u201cAs part of our agreement, there are still people as we speak from my ministry and from the navy and Turkish air force for coordination purposes on board the Nautilus.\u201d According to a Turkish military statement, the \u201cNautilus ship continued a deep search at points determined by Turkish Coast Guard (ship) Cesme by sonar, on 3-4 July, 2012, and the bodies of our pilots and some parts of the plane were reached.\u201d The bodies of Gokhan Ertan and Hasan Huseyin Aksoy were recovered Thursday.  They await a memorial ceremony at a Turkish airbase in Malatya on Friday. When contacted by CNN, a spokeswoman for the Nautilus\u2019 National Geographic-affiliated expedition said the group would not be commenting on its participation in the Turkish recovery operation. Scientists at the expedition\u2019s command center on the campus of the University of Rhode Island also said they could not comment on the emergency operation, though one scientist told a colleague that after the unexpected delay, he was \u201ceager to get back to doing science\u201d as soon as possible. The Turkish armed forces have released photographs of pieces of the downed Turkish jet resting on the Mediterranean sea bed.  It is highly likely that the photographs were taken by the Nautilus\u2019 ROVs. These photos could hold valuable evidence about what weapon was used to shoot down the jet.  The Syrian government insists anti-aircraft cannons brought the jet down when it flew within sight of the Syrian coast. Turkey says the jet was flying 13 nautical miles off the Syrian shore, in international airspace, when it was struck by a Syrian surface-to-air missile.  Syria\u2019s president suggested the military may have thought it was a plane belonging to Israel. History\u2019s deadliest plane crashes "

        "content": "Every year, millions of tons of milk deemed unsafe for human consumption are discarded in Europe. Now, a German company is turning the spilled milk into high-end fashion. Anke Domaske, a biochemist turned fashion designer, is the inventor of QMilch \u2013 a fabric made entirely of milk. \u201cMilk fabric has been around since the 1930s, but the process involved chemicals. QMilch doesn\u2019t, and it uses up fewer resources than natural fibers do,\u201d said Domaske, whose fashion label Mademoiselle Chi Chi is a favorite with stars including Mischa Barton and Ashlee Simpson. The fabric is created from milk which is allowed to ferment before it is turned into a powder. It is then heated and mixed with other natural ingredients and turned into yarn. \u201cTo make one kilo of cotton takes 20,000 liters of water\u2026our process only uses two liters of water,\u201d said the 29-year-old entrepreneur, who hopes her environmentally friendly fabric will revolutionize the fashion industry. The fabric might use less water than cotton but it is far more expensive to produce \u2013 QMilch costs around $30 per kilo to produce, compared to $3.8 per kilo for cotton yarn. QMilch has a similar feel to silk, and is marketed as a luxury fiber. But, unlike other labor intensive materials like silk \u2013 whose commodity prices fluctuate depending on the markets and the weather \u2013 the cost of QMilch is expected to be stable, which Domaske said is feeding into its popularity. \u201cWe are just ordering machines for producing 1,000 tons per year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is scaling up from producing two kilos per hour to 120 kilos per hour,\u201d she added. The fabric, which Domaske said is non-allergenic, is attracting interest outside of fashion. Makers of hospital and hotel bedding, and even car upholstery firms, are keen to clad their products in the sustainable fabric formerly known as milk."

        "content": "Italian judges released the captain of the wrecked Costa Concordia cruise liner from house arrest Thursday, but ordered him not to leave his home town while the case against him continues, his lawyer said. Francesco Schettino has been under house arrest in his home town of Meta di Sorrento, near Naples, since January 17. At least 30 people died when the cruise liner struck rocks and turned on its side off the Italian island of Giglio on January 13. Schettino faces allegations of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck, abandoning ship, failing to report an accident to the coast guard and destroying a natural habitat, a prosecutor said this year. Giglio is a protected park. Schettino\u2019s lawyer, Bruno Leporatti, had argued for the lifting of the restrictions on his client, saying his behavior had been \u201cfaultless.\u201d The judge leading the preliminary investigations, Valeria Montesarchio, said it would be easy to keep Schettino under \u201cadequate supervision\u201d in Meta di Sorrento without house arrest because it is a small town, according to court documents released Thursday. In addition, the months Schettino has spent under house arrest have already produced a \u201cdeterrent effect,\u201d Montesarchio said. Concordia disaster focuses attention on how cruise industry operates The judge also lifted a provision barring Schettino from communicating with anyone apart from his lawyers and family. From the beginning, Leporatti said, the attitude of the captain had been \u201ctotally collaborative, he has spoken on his defense but admitting his responsibilities, without trying to download them on others.\u201d The lawyer said the judge\u2019s decision to order Schettino to stay in his home town was \u201cthe least punitive measure\u201d available to him. Also on Thursday, Italian newspaper Corriere del Mezzogiorno published documents written by Schettino\u2019s lawyers that purport to be the captain\u2019s recollection of what happened on the night the Costa Concordia struck rocks off the Italian coast.  \u201cNo one, until then, had warned me that we had passed the point of turn on the fixed route. Luckily I saw the white froth on my left. It was a sign that made me give the order to tack to starboard, out of pure instinct. At that moment a divine hand has definitely landed on my head. If I had continued on that route, we hit the rock with the bow. It would have been a massacre,\u201d Schettino said, according to the newspaper. A court hearing on July 21 will start the examination of the enormous amount of technical information gathered in the wake of the disaster. Schettino\u2019s first officer, Ciro Ambrosio, and six other officers both on the ship and from the firm Costa in Genoa are under investigation over allegations including manslaughter, shipwreck and failure to report the accident, the prosecutor in the case has said. No one has been charged in connection with the shipwreck. Schettino previously has said managers of the Costa cruise line instructed him to sail close to the island and has denied allegations that he was sailing too fast. He has said the rock the ship struck was not indicated on his charts of the area. Salvage experts announced in May that efforts to raise the wrecked liner from the sea floor in one piece and tow it from the disaster site were getting under way. Covering a cruise ship disaster"

        "content": "The task facing  Agnieszka Radwanska in her first Grand Slam final is a daunting one, because in the opposite corner is Serena Williams, who\u2019ll be gunning for a 14th major singles titles. Radwanska, the No. 3 seed from Poland, defeated Angelique Kerber 6-3 6-4 on Centre Court to book her place in a showpiece final for the first time in her fledgling career. And her opponent will be 30-year-old Williams, who also recorded a straight sets win, disposing of the No. 2 seed Victoria Azarenka 6-3 7-6. Williams has won four singles crowns at the All England Club, the last of them coming in 2010, and powered past Azarenka, from Belarus, firing down 24 aces and 45 winners. By reaching her seventh Wimbledon final, she becomes the first 30-year-old to do so since 22-time Grand Slam winner Steffi Graf in 1999. \u201cI\u2019ve been working so hard, I really wanted it,\u201d she said in a post-match interview. \u201cShe was playing well and I got a little tight in the second set. I was looking too far in the future. I was so close, but I can\u2019t do that. I was happy  to get through that second set tie-break.\u201d Williams will go into Saturday\u2019s final the favorite given her experience and her head-to-head record against Radwanska \u2013 she hasn\u2019t dropped a set in their two meetings to date Serena can now boast 85 aces in this year\u2019s tournament, second only to German quarterfinalist Philipp Kohlschreiber, who has 98 to his name. Williams\u2019 performance against Azarenka was made all the more impressive by the fact that she played two doubles matches with sister Serena on Wednesday. Radwanska won on her Grand Slam semifinal debut to become Poland\u2019s first major finalist for 75 years. The 23-year-old and German Kerber are firm friends off the court but Radwanska told reporters she had to put personal feelings aside in pursuit of her Grand Slam goal. \u201cI\u2019m so happy, it\u2019s amazing. I played very good today,\u201d Radwanska said. \u201cIt\u2019s always tough against Angie. We are very good friends but of course on court we were both fighting for the final. \u201cI think we were both a bit nervous in the beginning, your hand is shaking a bit, but after a couple of games I relaxed. \u201cThis is what I dreamed of since I was a kid. Everyone wants to reach a Grand Slam final. It is the best two weeks of my career.\u201d Kerber, who defeated her friend and fellow German Sabine Lisicki in the quarterfinal, said she had lost to the better player. \u201cShe played very well today. I gave my best, but she was better,\u201d Kerber said. \u201cI was maybe one or two steps slower. I think that made the difference. \u201cMy plan was to be aggressive, but she moved very well and didn\u2019t make many mistakes, so it was really tough. \u201cActually it was a great tournament for me. I\u2019m in the semis here in Wimbledon. Sure, I\u2019m a little bit disappointed, but it\u2019s ok.\u201d "

        "content": "Football\u2019s lawmakers have taken the historic step of unanimously approving goal-line technology systems for use in the sport. World soccer\u2019s global governing body FIFA and the International Football Association Board (IFAB) made the announcement following a meeting in Zurich on Thursday. FIFA intend for goal-line technology to be used at December\u2019s Club World Cup in Japan, and if successful it will also be implemented at the 2013 African Cup of Nations and the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Two systems, designed by technology companies GoalRef and Hawk-Eye, have been approved after going through two phases of FIFA testing. UEFA chief opposed to goal-line technology FIFA president Sepp Blatter had previously opposed the move but said the turning point had been an incident at the 2010 World Cup involving a second round clash between England and Germany. Blatter was present when midfielder Frank Lampard\u2019s shot bounced well over the goal-line but was not awarded by the officials in a match England went on to lose 4-1. \u201cIt is a real approach of modern times in football,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt is so important because the objective in football is to score goals. It\u2019s a help for the referee. \u201cI\u2019m happy, I\u2019m pleased we are able to go forward. When it comes to high level competition and you have the technology and you don\u2019t use it something is wrong.  \u201cI have changed my attitude towards technology because of Lampard\u2019s kick in South Africa. That was the moment for me to say \u2018You are the president of FIFA and you cannot afford that in the next World Cup something similar will happen.\u2019\u201d The English Premier League welcomed the news, expressing its intention to bring in goal-line technology in the near future. \u201cThe Premier League has been a long-term advocate of goal line technology,\u201d read a statement on the organization\u2019s website. \u201cWe will engage in discussions with both Hawk-Eye and GoalRef in the near future with a view to introducing goal-line technology as soon as is practically possible.\u201d The IFAB is comprised of FIFA and the four UK-based football associations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is a body which decides on any proposed changes to the rules of soccer. Blog: Will FIFA regret opening technology can of worms? The announcement follows Blatter\u2019s recent calls for goal-line technology to be introduced in reaction to an incident that occurred during Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine. Co-hosts Ukraine saw a goal not given during a must-win group-stage match with England, when John Terry cleared Artim Milevskiy\u2019s shot after it looked to have crossed the line. Following the game on June 19, Blatter used his official Twitter account to declare: \u201cAfter last night\u2019s match #GLT is no longer an alternative but a necessity.\u201d But his stance on the issue is at odds with Michel Platini, the president of European football\u2019s governing body UEFA. The UEFA chief told CNN in May: \u201cI\u2019m against the technology. If you say OK to goal-line technology, then it is offside technology, then penalty area technology, and we stop the football.  \u201cI want human people \u2013 it\u2019s easy. I understand the fans because they want justice but with an additional referee we have the same justice.\u201d In addition to Milevskiy\u2019s \u201cgoal\u201d at Euro 2012, England have been involved in one other high-profile goal-line controversies. In the 1966 World Cup final, England were awarded a goal against West Germany when Geoff Hurst\u2019s shot in extra-time rebounded off the underside of the crossbar. England went on to win the match 4-2 at Wembley. At the same meeting, FIFA also confirmed it would permit the wearing of headscarves during a trial period. As there was no medical risk to wearing headscarves when playing a game of football, it has decided to relent on a ban introduced in 2007. Soccer\u2019s governing body had prevented teams wearing the traditional headscarves \u2013 which protect the modesty of Islamic girls and women \u2013 for safety reasons and to prevent political or religious statements."

        "content": "A series of errors by pilots and a failure to react effectively to technical problems led to the crash of Air France Flight 447, France\u2019s Bureau of Investigation and Analysis said Thursday in its final report on the disaster. The Brazil-to-France flight plunged into the Atlantic Ocean on June 1, 2009, killing all 228 people on board. The report details how the pilots failed to respond effectively to problems with the plane\u2019s speed sensors or to correct its trajectory when things first started to go wrong. When ice crystals blocked the plane\u2019s pitot tubes, which are part of a system used to determine air speed, the autopilot disconnected and the pilots did not know how to react to what was happening, the report said. \u201cThe occurrence of the failure in the context of flight in cruise completely surprised the crew of flight AF 447,\u201d the report said. The crew responded by over-handling the aircraft, which destabilized its flight path and caused further confusing readings, the report said. \u201cIn the first minute after the autopilot disconnection, the failure of the attempt to understand the situation and the disruption of crew cooperation had a multiplying effect, inducing total loss of cognitive control of the situation.\u201d The Airbus A330 went into a sustained stall, signaled by a warning message and strong buffeting of the aircraft, the report said. \u201cDespite these persistent symptoms, the crew never understood they were in a stall situation and therefore never undertook any recovery maneuvers.\u201d The pilots responded to the situation by pointing the nose upward, rather than downward, to recover. The report makes 25 new safety recommendations, on top of a number made in an initial report last year. Some of the recommendations have already been implemented, but it could take years for others fully to come into effect, chief investigator Alain Bouillard told reporters as he introduced the report. Opinion: Why do planes still crash? The international aeronautic community will likely focus on the crew\u2019s loss of awareness of what was going on, Bouillard said. The use of automatic systems on planes has improved safety overall, he explained, but \u201cwhen it comes down to it, safety will always be based on the capacity of the pilots and the signals which they are given, which they have to understand and react to.\u201d It was an \u201cexceptional\u201d inquiry because of the scale of the disaster, the number of countries involved and the difficulty of locating the plane\u2019s data recorders, he said. The intense media coverage of the crash added to the pressure, Bouillard said. It\u2019s a crash that never should have happened, said CNN\u2019s aviation specialist Richard Quest. The industry will be studying the human factors of the crew on the plane for many years to come. The Bureau of Investigation and Analysis said its report does not examine the issue of responsibility for the crash, which is the subject of a separate judicial inquiry. History\u2019s deadliest plane crashes The icing-up of the pitot tubes was \u201ca phenomenon that was known but misunderstood by the aviation community at the time of the accident,\u201d the report pointed out. Pilots should be trained on how to handle this event and a high-altitude stall with better technical instruction and flight simulator programs, the report said. Airplane ergonomics should also be improved, it said, \u201cto provide guidance to crews to help them recognize and manage unusual situations.\u201d International communications systems should also be reviewed to ensure swifter response and recovery efforts after accidents at sea, the report said. It took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of Flight 447\u2019s wreckage and the majority of the bodies in a mountain range deep under the ocean. The aircraft\u2019s voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered from the ocean floor in May 2011 after an extensive search using miniature submersible vehicles. The Bureau of Investigation and Analysis said the data indicated that Flight 447 crashed because the aircraft\u2019s speed sensors gave invalid readings. Who\u2019s really flying the plane? Last year\u2019s report from the bureau said the airplane climbed to 38,000 feet when \u201cthe stall warning was triggered and the airplane stalled.\u201d It then descended, crashing into the Atlantic. The descent lasted three minutes and 30 seconds, and the engines remained operational, the report said. Studies of the debris and bodies found soon after the crash led the French agency to conclude the plane hit the water belly first, essentially intact. Oxygen masks were not deployed, indicating that the cabin did not depressurize, the bureau said in a 2009 report. Flight 447 was passing through an area prone to volatile and dangerous weather known as the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone when it went down. The zone is a belt of low pressure that wraps around the planet. Clouds and storms form along it because it is literally where the winds of the world\u2019s hemispheres meet. Pilot: \u2018Damn it, we\u2019re going to crash\u2019 A previous report  from the French agency also raised questions about the training of the pilots on the flight.  The recorders revealed the pilots had failed to discuss repeated stall warnings and \u201chad received no high altitude training\u201d to deal with the situation, the bureau said. They failed to regain control of the aircraft, and no announcement was made to the passengers, of 32 different nationalities, before it plummeted from the sky. How did you react to the report? Sound off on CNN iReport. "

        "content": "He refers to himself as the industry\u2019s last remaining dinosaur, but Adrian Newey is the pioneering Formula One engineer who can consistently claim to be ahead of the curve. The 53-year-old\u2019s designs have delivered a total of 10 world titles, spread across three different constructors, putting the Briton in a class of his own. After successful spells with Williams and McLaren, Newey is now chief technical officer at Red Bull, where he produced the cars that swept Sebastian Vettel to back-to-back championships in 2011 and 2012 alongside double manufacturers\u2019 crowns. He can also count legends of the sport such as Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost, Damon Hill, Jacques Villeneuve and Mika Hakkinen as those who have triumphed under his hand since he started working in motor racing in 1980. CNN World Sport sat down with Newey at Red Bull\u2019s UK base to quiz him on his designs, his method of working and why he still prefers drawing by hand. How do you stay ahead of the curve every season? The design job is part iteration and part blue sky/light bulb-type thing. So if regulations are stable, quite often it\u2019s evolution in the Darwinian sense of the word, but occasionally we\u2019ll come up with a new idea which is not a derivation of what we\u2019ve been doing, it\u2019s coming from left field.  So it\u2019s really about trying to get that blend of evolution and revolution.  Where do you get your \u201clight bulb\u201d moments? They can come from anywhere. I quite often find that if I think about a problem for a while, store it, walk away and do something else \u2026 the brain is an amazing thing. It seems to tick away on a problem.  Sometimes the solution will pop up in the shower the next day, the next week. I\u2019m sure we all have different ways of working and I\u2019m obviously not the only person coming up with ideas. It\u2019s a big engineering company now.  The rules change every season. Do you relish it as a challenge or is it a headache? I enjoy regulation changes if they give new opportunities. The big changes we had at the start of 2009 gave all sorts of new opportunities; different ways to approach things, don\u2019t simply do things the way we\u2019ve always done and really try to think what are we trying to achieve here, what is the best solution or set of solutions to suit new regulations.  What I don\u2019t enjoy so much is when the regulations simply become more restrictive, when things that we\u2019re doing become banned. I think the danger there is that if the regulations become excessively restrictive, then all the cars will be the same and it will effectively be a runway chassis format.  You are well known for your low-tech approach to what is ultimately a very high-tech product \u2013 you draw a lot of your designs. How do you reconcile that? In terms of communicating my ideas and developing my ideas, I work on a drawing board \u2013 as opposed to all my colleagues now, who are obviously on computer-aided design (CAD) systems. I guess I\u2019m the last dinosaur in the industry.  I view it simply as a language. It\u2019s the way of taking an idea in the head \u2013 typically I\u2019ll take an idea, sketch it on a bit of paper and then develop it on the drawing board. Now, of course, as everything has to go onto the CAD system, I\u2019m lucky enough to have a team of two or three people who take my drawings and convert them into electronic images.  But whether you use a drawing board or go straight to the CAD I think it\u2019s really a personal preference. That\u2019s the way I grew up and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m getting a bit too much of a creature of habit to change.  Have you ever been forced to try the newer design technology?  When CAD first came in during the early 1990s, then various people \u2013 particularly when I was at Williams \u2013 said I ought to really be changing. Perhaps at that time when I was still in my 30s, I should have done.  But I like the freedom of drawing, the fact that you can sketch very easily, you can rub out, you can change, you can freehand. When I watch people on the CAD system now, that\u2019s still a weakness to me of the CAD system \u2013 the freehand ability and the ability to change things very quickly and easily with a rubber is not there.  What are the things that you are most proud of?  Certainly the first Formula One cars \u2013 I was involved in the Leyton House/March team from 1988. We were a very small team. It was only two aerodynamicists I think, including myself, on the car.  The total engineering team was five or six people. We were stuck with an abnormally aspirated engine which had far less power than the turbocharged engines of the era. So we set out to build an as aerodynamically-efficient car as we could.  That car I think genuinely changed the direction of F1 at the time. The cars had become quite big and clumsy and our little March was, despite being well done on power, was able to get ahead of McLaren and Ferrari and Williams, just by being aerodynamically efficient. Of course other people recognized that and over the coming years increasingly cars became a clone of the 1988 car.  Which of your innovations do you think have stood the test of time? Certainly my route has always been to try to put aerodynamics first and foremost in the design of the car because that\u2019s the biggest performance differentiator.  And that really is something now that is generally accepted \u2013 everybody does that. But in the 1980s when I first started that wasn\u2019t the norm. People tended to design the car mechanically first and foremost, and then the aerodynamicist was given the job of trying to fit the bodywork to it.  I think that philosophy is still in good stead. It\u2019s trying to recognize where do you get the biggest bang for your buck in terms of performance and then design accordingly.  Can you talk through the process from design to the road? You have a set of regulations, you then do the layout of the car, which obviously satisfies the regulations initially perhaps first and foremost, and then try to look for opportunities and try to develop ideas around that.  Once you have an aerodynamic concept together, that has to be transferred to a mechanical package that will physically transmit the aerodynamics to the road, the suspension, to hold all the vital things to drive with; the fuel, the engine.  So typically we have to work to league time schedules and the longest league time is the chassis itself \u2013 what we call the monocoque, which holds the front suspension, contains the driver and contains the fuel tank.  To the back of that is bolted the engine, which we are supplied by Renault. So we are not involved in the engine, other than how we install it in the car.  Then the other long league up item is the gearbox, which we do ourselves. It\u2019s a carbon composite case. So the monocoque and the carbon gear box case are the things we have to first get out as a piece of design.  Their shapes need to at least be designed by late August, early September to meet the league times necessary for the following year. Then once you have those big two items out, you go through and tick off the list of remaining items: suspension upright, suspension so on and so forth.  Do the legacy of your designs and innovation go beyond F1?  When I first started teams typically had five engineers or less, so there was very little research capability. It was purely a design job to design the car almost with the least amount of effort you could, as you just didn\u2019t have the resource.  Today the top Formula One teams will have over 100 engineers, maybe as much as 130. So we have a tremendous research capability.  That has meant that instead of it almost being something that general engineering took no notice of, we are now able to contribute to engineering developments in the same way as aerospace and automotives.  We will typically go from a blank sheet of paper to a complete in a space of around six months, and that\u2019s something which the aeronautical sector in particular is fascinated by because they have league times which are more like 10 years. So we borrow off them and in some areas they borrow off us now. When you get up in the morning, what\u2019s main thing driving you? I just enjoy the job. I enjoy the blend of design engineering, working with my fellow engineers, my colleagues here at Red Bull, working with the drivers, working with the mechanics and that blend of design and competition that we\u2019re out there every couple of weeks being measured on how we\u2019re doing \u2013 which if it\u2019s going well it\u2019s great, and if it\u2019s going poorly it\u2019s a lot of pressure.  What is so fascinating about motor racing is that blend of design and competition, and it really doesn\u2019t exist anywhere else. Yes of course there is technology in bicycles, tennis rackets and whatever but the budgets and the research are much smaller. We get to play with quite a grownup budget and we can get involved in lots of areas as a result of that. What\u2019s more important \u2013 the driver or the car? The answer is you have to have the combination. There are three principle things: the driver; the chassis, or the car less the engine; and the engine itself.  The main performance differentiator on the chassis is the aerodynamics. So to win races you\u2019ve got to have a good driver, good aerodynamics and a good engine. If you don\u2019t have that combination you might win the odd race but you certainly won\u2019t win championships."

After a 1-1 draw in last week\u2019s first leg in Buenos Aires, two goals from Brazil-born Qatar striker Emerson gave coach Tite\u2019s Corinthians a 2-0 second-leg win in Sao Paulo. Wednesday\u2019s historic win over six-time champions Boca ensured Corinthians\u2019 qualification for December\u2019s FIFA Club World Cup in Japan. It also means South America\u2019s premier club competition has been won by a Brazilian team in each of the last three years, following on from Santos in 2011 and Internacional. Are FIFA\u2019s world rankings fit for purpose? \u201cI am very happy because we know the history Boca Juniors have in worldwide football and in the Copa Libertadores,\u201d Emerson told Fox Sports. \u201cOur crowd represents 33 million fans. Since this year\u2019s Libertadores started, we have dreamt of clinching the title.

On a disappointing day for Boca, midfielder Juan Roman Riquelme also announced Wednesday\u2019s game would be his final appearance for the club. The 34-year-old began his career with Boca before spending six years in Spain with Barcelona and most notably Villarreal. The former Argentina international returned to Boca in 2008, helping his first club to two domestic titles to go with his three earlier Libertadores successes (2000-01, 2007). \u201cThis afternoon, I spoke with the president and informed him that I would not continue,\u201d Riquelme told reporters.  \u201cI am very grateful to the club and the team, I know I am, but I have nothing left to give the club, I\u2019m empty. The relationship I share with Boca is great, I\u2019m a fan of this club but now I have reached the end of the road. \u201cNow I just want to go home, have a barbecue with my friends, see my children and greet them. All I ask is for forgiveness from my child that I could not win the cup again.\u201d "

        "content": "While the likes of Roger Federer and Serena Williams strut their stuff at Wimbledon, spare a thought for the grass under their feet \u2013 which will take a double pounding in the next two months. Just 20 days after the men\u2019s final at the All England Club, the tennis competition at the 2012 London Olympics will begin \u2013 and the team working on the famous courts are keeping their fingers crossed that this week\u2019s inclement weather does not cause any further delays. Andy Newell from the Sports Turf Research Institute (STRI) gives Wimbledon head groundsman Eddie Seaward and his staff expert scientific advice on that preparation and admits that any delay into a third week would be a serious problem. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to lose time because they are already on such a fine edge and even a day would mean you lose 5% of your preparation, and that could be crucial,\u201d he told CNN. Ten of Wimbledon\u2019s courts will be used for the Olympics and it\u2019s going to prove Seaward\u2019s biggest challenge \u2013 coming in his final year in the job, after more than two decades of involvement. Preparation is the key, and the London Olympic Organizing Committee (LOCOG) insisted on a trial run at Wimbledon after the Games were awarded to the UK capital. Trial run \u201cWe worked on them just a couple of years ago to prove to LOCOG that we could do that within a short period of time, get the courts back in pristine condition,\u201d Seaward told CNN. But trial run or not, it\u2019s still a daunting prospect with little room for error. The grass must be cut to an exact 8 millimeters for optimum performance, and Seaward and his team have to keep a wary eye on that unpredictable British weather \u2013 ground temperature and humidity levels are constantly measured. For this reason, the expertise of scientists and agronomists is so important. STRI has been advising Wimbledon for over a decade. At its main testing center in a little corner of West Yorkshire, in northern England, its staff have recreated their own versions of Centre Court \u2013 trialing different varieties of grass to provide the best and most resilient surface. \u201cWe can test the grasses that they may use in the future here, \u201d said Newell, STRI\u2019s head of turf grass biology. \u201cWe can whittle them down, we can get rid of the chaff, hopefully keep the wheat for them.\u201d  Best grass Over the years, Newell and his colleagues have come to the conclusion that perennial ryegrass provides the best surface, both in terms of wear and playing characteristics.  \u201cIn essence we\u2019ve moved from one grass species which was inappropriate for Wimbledon, to one which was the best for Wimbledon,\u201d says STRI chief executive Gordon McKillop.  The company has grown to employ up to 85 people, and Wimbledon forms just part of their work. The cricket pitches at Lord\u2019s, the fairways and greens of St. Andrews, the home of golf, and the football turf for Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine have all had their grass tried and tested at STRI\u2019s research center in Bingley. When the pitch at the Euro 2012 game between France and the Ukraine dramatically flooded, experts from STRI were on hand to monitor its drying out. They had advised using a vacuum pump system when the Donbass Arena in Donetsk was constructed, and it paid off.    Weather gods   The team working on Wimbledon and the Olympics had been keeping their fingers crossed for the perfect growing conditions at SW19 in July and August. \u201cTwo weeks of wall-to-wall sunshine, not unbearably hot, with the odd contrast in conditions, perhaps a bit of rain, would make our job much easier,\u201d said Newell. But true to form the British weather has misbehaved during the championships and the inevitable rain delays have left organizers with more than a few headaches. For Newell the effect of such a varied climate on growing conditions is the bread and butter of his work. He has installed micro weather stations at Wimbledon to aid his research, as well as digging a small hole on Centre Court to measure moisture levels. \u201cIt\u2019s quite an important hole because it allows me to measure how much moisture there is at different depths,\u201d Newell said. \u201cMoisture is needed for the grass to grow, but it\u2019s also needed in the sense that we\u2019ve got to dry it out to get the ball to bounce.\u201d Surprise tactic The playing characteristics of the courts at Wimbledon have been the subject of debate and no little controversy over the years, with claims it now favors baseline play rather than classic serve and volley. Newell said the trend was more to do with the strength of the players, their rackets and the balls that are being used, rather than the surfaces being prepared. \u201cPlayers now use serve and volley as a surprise tactic rather than the norm,\u201d he said. During Seaward\u2019s time at the All England Club, he has seen that change of tactics reflected on the worn parts of his courts. \u201cWhen I first started here, the players used to serve and run in to return the ball, they used to check and stop and wear the grass out and there\u2019s a patch in the middle there. That slowly but surely moved further back every year, until it\u2019s completely disappeared,\u201d he said. Without the likes of Boris Becker and Pete Sampras charging forward to scuff up the grass in the middle of the court, the task of the groundsman has become rather easier, particularly with the tight Olympic deadline in mind. Seaward and his team will begin their Olympic work even while play is still taking place on the show courts. \u201cWe know the baseline is more worn than the rest of it, but by the time you get a bit of water on it, it starts to green up a bit,\u201d he said. Nature\u2019s way  The secret is using pre-germinated, or pre-grown seed, which is sowed into the worn patches. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to try to get some grass back in there, in a very short space of time,\u201d Seaward said. \u201cWithin a few days it will be up, hopefully, and we\u2019ll be preparing the courts.\u201d And bearing this in mind, there is a plus side to the constant drizzle that is coming out of the cloudy skies of London in what has proved a pretty miserable summer.   \u201cFor growing grass, rain is a bonus,\u201d said Newell, adding that water from the sky falls more evenly than that supplied by artificial sprinklers.   Newell believes that the soil texture underneath the grass is just as important in determining the playing characteristics, but knows that when hosting the biggest sports show on earth, aesthetics are important. \u201cThe idea is that we get the court to look the way it\u2019s going to look on the opening Monday of Wimbledon.\u201d But he warned: \u201cIt all comes back to nature, and nature can\u2019t be rushed.\u201d If the joint efforts of all those involved are ultimately successful, perhaps the International Olympic Committee could award a special gold medal to Seaward and his extended team \u2013 because working around the clock, they may well have deserved it."

        "content": "Brazilian soccer icon Zico has hailed the South American country\u2019s World Cup-winning team of 1958 as the best in the sport\u2019s history, ahead of the reigning world and European champions Spain. After a thumping 4-0 victory over Italy in the final of Euro 2012 last weekend, Spain became the first team to win three consecutive major tournaments \u2013 following on from triumphs at the 2010 World Cup and the European Championship of 2008. The recent success enjoyed by Vicente del Bosque\u2019s team has led some to label them as the finest ever, leading to comparisons with other legendary teams \u2013 such as the Brazil squad which became world champions in 1970. But former \u201cselecao\u201d star Zico, currently coach of the Iraq national team, selected the Brazil team which lifted the Jules Rimet trophy in Sweden 54 years ago as the finest in football history. The greatest football team: Spain 2012 vs. Brazil 1970? \u201cFor me the best national team of all time is the Brazilian team from 1958,\u201d Zico, who was part of the much-heralded Brazil team which reached the second group stage of the 1982 World Cup, exclusively told CNN. Is victorious Spain the best team ever? \u201cQuite simply because it had, in my opinion, the best players in the world. Pele and Garrincha. They scored a bag full of goals and put in a show in almost every game.\u201d Pele rose to prominence as a 17-year-old at the 1958 tournament, scoring six goals including a brace in Brazil\u2019s 5-2 defeat of hosts Sweden in the final. The striker is widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers the sport has ever seen and, after being hampered by injury during his country\u2019s 1962 World Cup win, he was a key figure in Brazil\u2019s 1970 success. Garrincha was a tricky winger who not only won the World Cup in 1958, but starred as Brazil retained the trophy in Chile four years later. His four goals made him joint top goalscorer alongside teammate Vava.  The flamboyant Garrincha, who spent the vast majority of his career with Rio de Janeiro-based Botafogo, died of cirrhosis of the liver in 1983 aged 49. Strutting midfielder Zico is fondly remembered by many football fans for his stylish contribution to the Brazil team which lit up the 1982 competition in Spain, alongside playmaker Socrates."

        "content": "Early this year Ukraine \u2013 along with much of eastern Europe \u2013 was caught in a deep and protracted cold snap. Many froze to death, energy demand spiked, and to top it all Russia accused Ukraine of stealing gas from transit pipes destined for western Europe for the second time in three years.  Ukraine issued a firm denial, adding another blot to the two nations\u2019 fraught \u2013 but highly dependent \u2013 relationship. The fact remains that Ukraine needs Russian gas while Russia needs Ukraine\u2019s transit pipeline to export west. The spat came on the heels of a disastrous relationship meltdown in 2009, when for two nerve-wracking weeks Russia abruptly stopped pumping gas to Ukraine and Europe. The Russian energy giant Gazprom claimed Ukraine\u2019s gas company \u2013 Naftogaz Ukrainy \u2013 owed it huge sums of money in missed payments and fines. However, Naftogaz countered that it had paid the bill and claimed that Gazprom was in fact trying to force it to accept a new price for gas which it could ill afford. They eventually reached a deal, but Ukraine\u2019s Prime Minister Mykola Azarov still maintains that the terms are unfair: \u201cAmericans pay $70 for 1000 cubic meters of gas when Ukraine pays $550 to Russia for the same amount. It means almost ten times more. Tell me what kind of economy can take this?\u201d He told CNN.  However, America benefits from its own vast reserves of natural gas, and Russia argues that still Ukraine gets it for less than consumers in Poland, Hungary, Turkey and Romania. So, while Ukraine tries to negotiate a better deal with Russia, it\u2019s also working to break its dependency on Russian gas and diversify its sources of energy. A key part of the plan is to import liquid natural gas from other countries \u2013 such as Azerbaijan \u2013 which will be processed at a terminal built near the vast port of Odessa on the Black Sea. The head of the project, Vitaly Demyanin, says that by 2018 it should have replaced 30% of existing Russian gas imports. \u201cIt will have 10 billion cubic meters of alternative gas. It will help us to negotiate with our main supplier,\u201d he said. At the same time Yury Boiko, the Ukrainian energy minister, has high hopes that shale gas \u2013 formed deep underground within large shale rock formations \u2013 could also be a major alternative source of power in the decades to come. He told CNN that shale gas exploration in western Ukraine has \u201cvery large potential.\u201d But it\u2019s not just alternative gas supplies that the energy-hungry nation of 44.8 million residents has in its sights.  The government has pledged to invest heavily in green energy. However, this won\u2019t do much to bolster their eco-credentials, as they are also planning to burn a great deal more coal too. It\u2019s all testament to their increasing desire to generate power without recourse to gas.    Meanwhile, as Ukraine looks for other energy supplies, Russia is looking for other ways to get its gas to Europe. Russia is the world\u2019s biggest producer of natural gas and supplies Europe with nearly 40% of its imports, according to the European Commission . It has already built one pipeline that bypasses Ukraine.  The 765-mile long \u201cNord Stream\u201d pipeline \u2013 costing more than $12 billion \u2013 directly links Russia with the European Union via the Baltic Sea bed. At its launch in 2011, the then Russian Prime Minister, now President, Vladimir Putin, made an ominous and thinly-veiled reference to his Ukrainian neighbors.  \u201cAny transit country has always the temptation to take advantage of its transit status,\u201d he said. \u201cThat exclusivity is now disappearing.\u201d At the end of this year, Russia plans to begin construction on another gas pipe to Europe \u2013 the \u201cSouth Stream\u201d \u2013 running through the Black Sea to Bulgaria and on to Greece, Italy and Austria. The projects threaten to strip Ukraine of billions in revenue and any remaining leverage it might have over future gas prices. But in an effort to salvage long-term relations, Ukraine is now proposing a new model that would allow themselves, Europe and Russia equal control of their transit system. \u201cSo the consumers, the sellers, the supply and transit country is together. It\u2019s a good model and it\u2019s convenient for everybody,\u201d says energy minister Boiko.   Only time will tell if these major energy reforms will change Russia\u2019s position in future negotiations and transform the horizon of Ukraine\u2019s economic future."

        "content": "Britain\u2019s police swung into action Thursday as two separate incidents, one involving a security scare on a bus and the other six terror arrests, pointed to the heightened state of alert ahead of the London Olympic Games. Security is a central concern for UK authorities and the organizers of the Olympics, which start in three weeks. After launching a major response to the security alert on the bus, which led armed officers to close a major motorway, police in Staffordshire concluded the incident was not terror-related. But its officers responded \u201cswiftly and proportionately\u201d to credible information from a concerned member of the public, a Staffordshire police statement said. \u201cWe can now confirm that, whilst this was a genuine security alert, the significant concerns reported to us were unfounded,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe information received concerned a report of vapor escaping from a bag which on investigation turned out to be a health improvement aid for smokers.\u201d Hours earlier, police in London arrested five men and a woman on terror charges, although they said the operation was not related to the Olympics. The six, aged from 18 to 30, were all arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism and are being questioned, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police said. Officers searched homes in east, west and north London as well as business premises in east London. One of the men arrested had worked from 2007 to 2009 as a police community support officer for the Met Police, the force said in a statement, and \u201cwas not deployed in a specialist or sensitive role.\u201d Police community support officers are members of staff who work alongside the regular police force, mostly to tackle local anti-social behavior and low level issues. The operation in London is not linked to the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the police said. British security officials on alert for Olympic terror threats Additional security measures will be in place in London and elsewhere during the Olympics. They include the siting of missile defense systems around the capital and fighter jets on standby at air bases close to London. Police and intelligence agencies have also stepped up monitoring efforts. Thursday\u2019s dramatic closure of the busy M6 Toll motorway, near Birmingham, had many hallmarks of a response to a potential terror threat and could be seen as a sign that police are taking no chances.  Armed police, firefighters and military bomb disposal units raced to the scene as passengers were evacuated from the bus, which had pulled over near the town of Lichfield. Police in Britain are not usually armed when they respond to incidents. Officials insist no specific terror threats tied to Olympics Passengers were lined up on the tarmac for questioning, and their luggage and the vehicle searched, before police confirmed that there was no terror threat and that no one was considered a suspect. \u201cOur utmost priority was the safety and security of those people on the coach and those traveling on the motorway,\u201d the force said. The 48 passengers who were on the bus from the northwestern city of Preston to London are now being taken on to their planned destination, a spokeswoman for Megabus said. \u201cWe would like to thank our customers for their patience and understanding during today\u2019s police operation, which followed concerns raised by a passenger during the journey,\u201d a statement from the bus operator said. \u201cThe safety and welfare of our passengers and our staff is our absolute priority.\u201d The bus has been moved and the highway has reopened, police said. Government officials from Washington to London insist there are no known specific or credible terror threats tied to the Olympic. Nonetheless, authorities on both sides of the Atlantic are urging vigilance. The Metropolitan Police is leading the \u201clargest peacetime operation\u201d seen in the United Kingdom as it seeks to keep the public safe, it said, with up to 9,500 police officers from London and elsewhere to be deployed on the busiest days of the Olympics. As a result, London\u2019s residents and its visitors can expect to see a large police presence on the streets and airport-style security at Olympic venues."

        "content": "Dutch international striker Robin van Persie has turned down a new contract at Arsenal, signaling his likely departure from the English Premier League side. Van Persie made the announcement Wednesday on his official website. The 28-year-old has only a year left on his remaining deal and Arsenal will likely have no option than to transfer him rather than see him depart on a Bosman free transfer. \u201cI\u2019ve thought long and hard about it, but I have decided not to extend my  contract,\u201d Van Persie said. \u201cYou guys, the fans, have of course the right to disagree with my view and decision and I will always respect your opinions,\u201d he added. Van Persie is considered key to Arsenal\u2019s hopes of improving on their distant third place finish in the EPL last season behind Manchester City and Manchester United. He scored 37 goals in 48 games  for the Gunners last season, including 30 in the Premier League. His efforts also won him the two major player of the year awards in English football, but van Persie said he was keen to win trophies.  He has just the 2005 FA Cup win to show for his time with Arsenal since his transfer from Dutch side Feyenoord in 2004. To this end, van Persie said he had met with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger and the chief executive Ivan Gazidis at the end of last season to discuss his future and their ambitions for the club. \u201cOut of my huge respect for Mr. Wenger, the players and the fans I don\u2019t want to go into any details, but unfortunately in this meeting it has again become clear to me that we in many aspects disagree on the way Arsenal FC should move forward,\u201d he added. \u201cI am very proud of being part of this fantastic club for the last eight years. As soon as Mr.Gazidis is back from his two-week holiday in America further meetings will follow and I will update you if and when there are more developments.\u201d Van Persie has been heavily linked with a move to EPL champions Manchester City, while Serie A winners Juventus are also believed to be keen on his signature. He would be the most notable departure from Arsenal since Spanish star Cesc Fabregas left last summer to join Barcelona.  "

        "content": "Romania\u2019s leftist government began impeachment proceedings Wednesday to suspend President Traian Basescu. In a motion filed in parliament, the ruling coalition accused the president of violating the country\u2019s constitution and overstepping his authority. The motion is the latest in a series of attacks over the past month between Basescu and Prime Minister Victor Ponta. A vote on the motion scheduled for Friday is expected to pass, given that the coalition holds a comfortable majority in parliament. If this were to happen, Basescu would be suspended for a month and the country would hold a referendum within 30 days on whether he should remain in office. During the president\u2019s suspension, National Liberal Party leader Crin Antonescu, who is also the newly appointed president of the Senate, would assume the interim presidency. The ruling alliance of Social Democrats and Liberals this week passed a law making it easier for the coalition to impeach Basescu. In addition, Ponta accused some Constitutional Court judges of political bias and incompatibility and suggested that they be replaced. The court, in turn, said Ponta was trying to dismantle it and threaten its independence. EU Commissioner for Justice Viviane Reding said on Twitter that she was \u201cseriously concerned about the recent attacks on the independence of the Constitutional Court of Romania.\u201d On Tuesday, the ruling coalition sacked the heads of both chambers of parliament, who were Basescu allies, and replaced them with politicians close to Ponta. Also Tuesday, the coalition dismissed the country\u2019s ombudsman, whom it accused of political bias. The newly appointed ombudsman, Valer Dorneanu, is a former Social Democrat member of parliament.  Basescu told reporters Tuesday that the country\u2019s current situation can be compared with riots that occurred in June 1990 by miners who staged violent demonstrations in the streets of Bucharest with the goal of bringing about political change. \u201cI warn the politicians that by breaking the country\u2019s laws and constitution, the country and its 22 million people are put in an extremely difficult situation,\u201d Basescu said. The impeachment motion is to be read Thursday during a special meeting of parliament. Coalition leader Antonescu has invited Basescu to address parliament directly on the matter. The political developments have raised concern from some observers about the state of democracy in Romania. U.S. Ambassador to Bucharest Mark Gitenstein said he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that the independence of the country\u2019s democratic institutions was under threat. Romania\u2019s government became the object of international criticism after Ponta was accused of plagiarizing his doctoral thesis. Ponta dismissed the accusation as a political attack from Basescu. The two men also argued over who was entitled to represent Romania at last month\u2019s meeting of the European Council in Brussels.  Ponta received Parliament\u2019s vote to go to Brussels on behalf of the country, but the Constitutional Court ruled that president Basescu had the right to attend the event. In the end, the prime minister ignored the court\u2019s ruling and traveled to Brussels. The coalition government has come under criticism recently for ordering that Romania\u2019s Cultural Institute report not to the president, as it had been doing, but to the Senate. The institute is known for promoting Romania\u2019s cultural values and projects abroad as well as for supporting its artists, writers and cultural movements. The country\u2019s civil society and anti-corruption agencies addressed on Wednesday a letter to the president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, expressing concern over this \u201cunprecedented attack\u201d on the rule of law. On Wednesday evening, some 300 people protested in front of the Government and at University Square in Bucharest. While some called for Basescu and Ponta to step down, others expressed concern over the threats to the country\u2019s democratic institutions. Ponta recently acknowledged that Romania is going through a credibility crisis at an international level but predicted the turmoil would end after this fall\u2019s parliamentary elections."

        "content": "More than three years after Air France Flight 447 plunged into the southern Atlantic Ocean, killing all 228 people aboard, authorities are preparing to release their final report on the fatal crash. France\u2019s Bureau of Investigation and Analysis (BEA) said the data indicated that the flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris crashed because the aircraft\u2019s speed sensors gave invalid readings, but there are other theories on why the plane went down. When did Flight 447 go down? Flight 447 \u2013 which was en route to Paris from Rio de Janeiro \u2013 made its last contact with Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Control Center (ACC) at around 01:33 GMT on June 1, 2009, informing the center of the plane\u2019s position as it crossed the Atlantic. Soon after, Brazil\u2019s air control contacted Dakar\u2019s control center in North Africa and reported that AF 447 was entering an area on its route known for constant bands of severe turbulence, officials said. There was no further contact with the plane. History\u2019s deadliest plane crashes Do we know why Flight 447 crashed? Last year\u2019s BEA report said the airplane climbed to 38,000 feet when \u201cthe stall warning was triggered and the airplane stalled.\u201d It then descended, crashing into the Atlantic. The descent lasted 3 minutes and 30 seconds and the engines remained operational, said the report.  Studies of the debris and bodies that were found soon after the crash led the BEA to conclude the plane hit the water belly first, essentially intact. Oxygen masks were not deployed, indicating that the cabin did not depressurize, the BEA said in a 2009 report. Tests have already brought into question the performance of pitot tubes, which measure the pressure exerted on the plane as it flies through the air, and are part of a system used to determine air speed. Before it crashed, Flight 447 sent out 24 automated error messages that suggested the plane may have been flying too fast or too slow through the thunderstorms, officials have said. The European Aviation Safety Agency issued a directive in late August requiring airlines to replace pitot tubes manufactured by Thales Avionics on Airbus A330s and A340s. It said airlines should replace them with other Thales tubes and those manufactured by Goodrich. The lack of speed, wind or direction information also prevented the Autopilot system from functioning, said air accident investigator Alain Bouillard said at the time of the crash. \u201cThis tells us that the plane has to be, in this case, directed by the pilot,\u201d he said. Who\u2019s really flying the plane? What about the weather? Flight 447 was passing through an area prone to volatile and dangerous weather known as the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), when it went down. The ITCZ is a belt of low pressure that wraps around the planet. Clouds and storms form along it because it is literally where the winds of the world\u2019s hemispheres meet. Here, air and water temperatures are typically in the mid-80s. The warm, moist air is heated further by the blazing tropical sun. Steamy air, coming off the ocean, rises until it hits cooler, drier air aloft, forming clouds and thunderstorms. These gigantic storms contain volatile updrafts and downdrafts that can move at speeds of 100 mph. The height of these storms also can tower to more than 10 miles in the air. Even if you stacked two dozen of the world\u2019s tallest skyscrapers on top of each other, they still wouldn\u2019t reach the tops of the biggest thunderstorms of the ITCZ. However Learmount pointed out that hundreds of airliners pass through the ITCZ every day without incident. \u201cThere was another Air France flight 30 minutes behind Flight 447 that night and it encountered no problems,\u201d he said. 153 bodies identified from 2009 Air France crash Any other theories? According to Learmount, many aviation experts have yet to rule out the human factor. \u201cThe crash happened at around 2:00 a.m. on a dark night when the error messages suddenly appeared and the autopilot tripped out.\u201d He said the crew, possibly at their deepest circadian low at this point, suddenly have this problem and they \u201cfixate\u201d on it. \u201cThis is a syndrome,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been lots of accidents where pilots have fixated on correcting a relatively minor problem and lose sight of the macro problem. Now we don\u2019t know that, but we do know the aircraft acted as if it was not being controlled purposefully. \u201cWhether it was out of control \u2013 and I doubt this \u2013 it was not being controlled. Imagine it is 2 am and two sleepy pilots encounter a problem. They don\u2019t have much to do so they decide to troubleshoot this problem. They fixate on it and forget the autopilot has tripped. \u201cThe airplane meanwhile goes into a lazy spiral descent \u2013 the pilots don\u2019t notice as it is all very gentle. And when they look up they don\u2019t believe what their instruments tell them and they get disorientated and can\u2019t recover.\u201d He highlighted a similar case in 2004 when pilot disorientation and loss of control caused a Flash Airlines Boeing 737-300 to crash in the Red Sea shortly after take off from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el Sheikh. Though Egyptian authorities disputed the claim, aviation safety officials in France and the U.S. cited \u201cspatial disorientation\u201d as the likely cause based on evidence available, according to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). How long did it take to find the wreckage? It took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the plane\u2019s flight recorder and the bulk of the wreckage, still containing many bodies, in a mountain range deep under the ocean. The area where the Airbus A330 went down is in the mid-Atlantic \u2013 two to four days for ships to reach from the nearest ports in Brazil or Senegal in West Africa. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates the ocean depth in the area at 3,000 meters (about 9,840 feet) to 7,500 meters (24,600 feet). Brazilian officials have said the sea depth in the area is around 2,000 to 3,000 meters (6,562 to 9,842 feet). The search that turned up the bulk of the wreckage in 2011 covered a 46-mile (75-kilometer) radius around the last known position of Flight 447, investigators said, in an area rough with underwater mountains and valleys. \u201cIt is a mountain range as big as the Alps,\u201d David Learmount of Flight International told CNN. \u201cThere was always the possibility that the wreckage from the aircraft disappeared down a crevasse. This is not a flat-bottom environment like the North Sea is.\u201d Crash pilot: \u2018Damn it, we\u2019re going to crash\u2019 "

        "content": "It was one of the worst passenger ship disasters since the sinking of the Titanic a century ago. On January 13, the Costa Concordia was sailing a few hundred meters off the rocky Tuscan coastline of the island of Giglio.  The ship, nearly the length of three football fields, rammed into a bed of rocks around 9:45 p.m. Within minutes, the massive vessel began to tilt, as water rushed into the engine rooms through a gash some 50 meters long. The crippled ship, without power or propulsion, drifted onward a few miles before turning toward the small harbor on the island and coming to rest on rocks nearby.  Thirty-two people from eight countries \u2013 both crew and passengers \u2013 died. Many more barely escaped in the hours after the Concordia came to rest on its side, tilting ever closer to the sea. Countless survivors told CNN the same story \u2013 they had received little or no safety training after boarding the ship, whether in Barcelona several days earlier or at a port near Rome just hours before the disaster. International guidelines at the time recommended a safety drill within 24 hours of embarkation, but the disaster came well before that period had elapsed for the 600 who stepped on board in Rome. Multiple passengers who spoke to CNN and other media said they didn\u2019t know where to gather during the emergency. The common refrain: It was chaos, every passenger for him or herself. Some said that when they asked crew members for help, they got blank stares. Covering a cruise ship disaster Nearly six months later, lessons learned that night have brought changes to safety and evacuation procedures in the cruise industry. Carnival, the parent line of Costa, and several other cruise lines now require safety instruction, referred to as muster drills, before leaving port. The new muster policy consists of 12 specific emergency instructions, which include providing information on when and how to don a life jacket, where to muster and what to expect if there is an evacuation of the ship. Last year, nearly 16 million cruise bookings were made worldwide. About three-quarters of them were from the United States, according to the industry group Cruise Lines International Association, which represents 26 cruise lines, including the world\u2019s largest, Carnival and Royal Caribbean. But the Concordia disaster cast a shadow on a rapidly expanding industry that maintains it is one of the safest modes of transportation. It has also focused attention on how some international cruise companies operate, registering their ships in countries where there may be weak regulations or where international rules are poorly enforced, but at the same time headquartering their companies in the United States and Europe.  At a U.S. Senate hearing in the aftermath of the Concordia disaster, there was tough questioning about the practice. Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, one of the strongest voices at the congressional hearing, spoke to CNN about the cruise lines.  \u201cThey just know how to work the system and they work it very well and always to their advantage,\u201d he said. Rockefeller and other critics of the industry say that cruise lines that are headquartered in the United States but have their ships registered elsewhere are getting a free ride on the backs of U.S. taxpayers, placing demands on federal agencies such as Immigration, Customs and the Coast Guard, which are charged with oversight when those ships enter and leave U.S. ports. \u201cThey don\u2019t reimburse the Coast Guard, they don\u2019t pay taxes that will help with these 20 federal agencies that are watching over them in various ways and whose services they use, or might use,\u201d Rockefeller told CNN.  In the five years before 2010, Carnival, the company that owns Costa, paid 1.1% tax on $11.3 billion in profits. Leading U.S.-based companies like Carnival often register their ships in foreign countries under what the industry calls \u201cflags of convenience.\u201d For example, Carnival registers the majority of its ships in Panama and is incorporated there. Its headquarters is in the United States. Despite repeated requests, Carnival did not grant CNN an interview. However, Bud Darr, a spokesman for the Cruise Lines International Association, the industry group that represents Carnival and other major cruise lines, told CNN, \u201cThere\u2019s a variety of components that go into that decision [about where to register a ship] and it\u2019s individualized to a ship\u2019s owner.  It\u2019s individualized across maritime sectors.\u201d Budd added, \u201cAre there some fees and taxation considerations that go into that? Certainly.\u201d  The International Transport Workers Federation, which represents mariners around the world, is highly critical of \u201cforeign flagging,\u201d saying on its website, \u201cCheap registration fees, low or no taxes and freedom to employ cheap labor are the motivating factors behind a ship owner\u2019s decision to \u2018flag out.\u2019\u201d However, the Cruise Lines International Association maintains its members pay plenty of port and other fees in the United States. \u201cWe pay a wide array of fees, duties and we pay all of the taxes we are required to pay,\u201d Darr told CNN. Rockefeller said that while more regulation of the industry is needed, achieving that will be difficult because of the industry\u2019s lobbying in Washington. According to Darr, the Cruise Lines International Association spent nearly $10 million on lobbying between 2004 and 2011.   The International Maritime Organization, which is tasked with the international supervision of passenger ships, has also been under fire in the wake of the disaster. Under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, known as SOLAS, there are many mandated standards for ship operators, but critics \u2013 including U.S. lawmakers \u2013 point to the fact that there are also many codes, guidelines and recommendations that are voluntary.  Additionally, there are no unified standards for reporting incidents at sea. The International Maritime Organization does keep records of incidents reported voluntarily by ship operators, but does not maintain a public database of that information.   The International Maritime Organization has promised to address the issues raised by critics once the Italian authorities\u2019 accident report is published. So far, its Maritime Safety Committee, which met five months after the sinking of the Costa Concordia, has issued only voluntary guidance. That new guidance includes the introduction of onboard stability computers, new free-fall lifeboats and the establishment of appropriate minimum levels for staffing qualified mariners on board each passenger ship.  Bloggers and industry observers, meanwhile, have tried to fill any gaps left by the International Maritime Organization by archiving incidents, relying on information from media reports and passengers. Ross Klein, a Newfoundland professor, has written four books on the cruise industry and maintains a database online. At the congressional hearings in March, he told the Senate committee there were more than a dozen incidents of passenger ships sinking and 99 ships running aground between 1973 and 2011.  Klein also testified that 79 ships experienced fires between 1990 and 2011. Even so, given the rapid expansion of the industry, the number of fatalities has been low.  And cruising remains popular. The industry is now worth $25 billion a year. Most of its customers are Americans, with 13 million U.S. bookings in 2011. The industry also is tapping into new markets, especially in Asia.  In the spring, a few months after the Concordia disaster, Costa released a statement that said bookings were robust. Meanwhile, the Cruise Lines International Association maintains the industry is committed to ensuring the safety of passengers. But industry insiders and regulators say another serious accident could do irreparable damage to the cruise lines\u2019 reputation \u2013 and reinforce existing calls for more rigorous international regulation."

        "content": "After becoming the first team to defend the European Championships, adding a second continental title to the World Cup won in 2010, many observers have been quick to label Spain the greatest team in the history of international football. An emphatic 4-0 thrashing of Italy, the biggest margin of victory ever seen in a world or European final, continued a remarkable run which has seen Spain not concede a goal in a knockout match since the great Zinedine Zidane found the back of their net for France at the 2006 World Cup. Comparisons are now being drawn with teams like the Pele-inspired Brazil of the 1970 World Cup, which won six games at the tournament to become three-time world champions \u2013 averaging 3.2 goals per game. So how do Spain, led by the \u201cillustrious\u201d Vicente del Bosque and built around the Barcelona-bred midfield axis of Xavi and Andres Iniesta, stack up against the \u201cselecao\u201d of 42 years ago, which featured icons like Pele, Jairzinho and Tostao? \u201cA team who win back-to-back European titles, and a World Cup in the middle, have a very strong claim to being the best ever,\u201d said World Soccer contributor and Brazilian football journalist Fernando Duarte. \u201cMy pinch of salt would be the Brazil 1970 side, how many chances would they have had to play big tournaments? The South American Championship (now the Copa America) was always poorly organized.\u201d La Roja\u2019s recent domination of international football has been underlined by goalkeeper and captain Iker Casillas, who, after Sunday\u2019s final in Kiev, became the first player to record 100 wins in international football \u2013 accumulated over 137 matches. Blog: Spain make compelling case as best team ever The Real Madrid goalkeeper\u2019s importance to his country was apparent as Spain conceded just one goal en route to retaining their European crown \u2013 Antonio di Natale\u2019s strike for Italy when the two teams drew 1-1 in their opening Group C match. In contrast Mario Zagallo\u2019s samba stars shipped seven goals in just six games in Mexico in 1970. \u201cSpain have arguably one of the best goalkeepers to grace this world,\u201d said Duarte. \u201cIker Casillas is unbelievably good. He\u2019s so good people now presume Spain has always produced good goalkeepers. \u201cUntil the mid-1980s, Brazil were known for producing dodgy goalkeepers. Felix, the goalkeeper in 1970, was bad. Even by the standards of Brazilians, people used to say he wasn\u2019t the right guy.\u201d But the success of Zagallo\u2019s team was not built on defense. Instead it was made possible through an irrepressible attack which, in powerful forward Jairzinho, boasted one of only three players to have scored in every match of a World Cup tournament. Jairzinho\u2019s goals, combined with the four scored by Pele and three from Rivelino, helped Brazil amass 19 in six World Cup matches, beating reigning champions England along the way. \u201cJairzinho is a hero,\u201d said Duarte. \u201cHe is like the typical striker every European team would love to have. That guy was like a bulldozer.  \u201cThey had Pele, in his swansong after two very mediocre World Cups in 1962 and 1966. They were a machine, a very efficient team. \u201cThey could play the ball, they could do a lot of trickery. But on the other hand, they appealed to the Europeans because of the lack of \u2018samba\u2019 or dribbling. They were pretty much a European team.\u201d Duarte also points to the physical prowess of Zagallo\u2019s 11, who helped shatter traditional preconceptions regarding the strength and fitness of South American players \u2013 culminating in a thumping 4-1 win over Italy in the 1970 final. \u201cBrazil showed up in Mexico City with a bunch of horses,\u201d explained Duarte. \u201cClearly they could play, but they were also fit. \u201cItaly beat West Germany in the semifinal and arrived in the final against Brazil tired, they were steamrollered by the Brazilians. Every second half in that competition, Brazil murdered everybody else.\u201d The lasting appeal of this Brazil team, Duarte believes, is also linked to technology which allowed the 1970 World Cup to be beamed around the globe in color \u2013 allowing viewers a first glimpse of the iconic yellow shirt. \u201cIt was the first global World Cup. People sat in front of the television and watched it properly. \u201cNo one remembers 1962 and outside of Europe people don\u2019t really remember 1966. It was a World Cup where TV technology was pretty much together. It was easier for people to see it.\u201d Iniesta \u2018symbolized Euro 2012 success\u2019 Taking into account all of the statistics, considering Spain\u2019s domineering tiki taka possession-based style and Brazil\u2019s \u201cjogo bonito,\u201d which team will history remember as the better? \u201cI would love to see them play against each other,\u201d said Duarte. \u201cAs a dynasty, Spain now are better. That Brazilian team was nothing like the team of four years earlier. The Spanish team has been largely the same since 2008. \u201cHead-to-head, I think some differences have to be observed. Spain doesn\u2019t have a Pele, they certainly don\u2019t have a Carlos Alberto (the captain who scored the iconic fourth goal in the 1970 final \u2013 widely regarded as the finest in history).\u201d The next World Cup will be hosted by Brazil, bringing back memories of when the South Americans held the tournament in 1950, missing out on a first world crown by losing in the final match to Uruguay. \u201cThe pressure of playing at home will be horrendous,\u201d explained Duarte. \u201cEven in a meaningless match, if Brazil don\u2019t score in the first five minutes the crowd start booing. Blog:  Are Spain boring? \u201cSouth American champions Santos played Barcelona (of Spain) in the Club World Cup final last year, and that\u2019s one of the things which has Brazil scared. \u201cSantos were trounced and that sent shockwaves around Brazil. These guys were the basis of the Spanish team, and they just made fools of the best team in South America.\u201d So is there any hope of Brazil lifting the World Cup trophy for a sixth time at a rebuilt Maracana stadium in two years\u2019 time? \u201cThey have some very decent players emerging. Striker Neymar is a genius, you have players like attacking midfielder Ganso and playmaker Oscar,\u201d Duarte said. \u201cI am sure they will have a very good team in 2014. If you asked me right now, \u2018Will Brazil win the World Cup?\u2019 my answer is no. Can Brazil win it? Yes, if things change.\u201d  "

        "content": "Defending Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic and six-time winner Roger Federer will meet in the last four after both came through quarterfinal matches with comfortable straight sets victories Wednesday. Federer was at his imperious best as he crushed Russian Mikhail Youzhny 6-1 6-2 6-2 with Djokovic later joining him in the semifinals after dispatching Germany\u2019s Florian Mayer 6-4 6-1 6-4. \u201cRoger has been on the top of the men\u2019s game for so long. This is where he won six titles. He definitely wants to prove himself and to everybody else that he can win it once again,\u201d said Djokovic, who will lose the top ranking if Federer can win a record-extending 17th grand slam title on Sunday.  \u201cToday he won incredibly fast, in straight sets, so we\u2019ll see. I\u2019m playing well, I believe. We both have to play at our best in order to get a win. I really have nothing to lose. I\u2019m going to try to win.\u201d  Britain\u2019s home hope Andy Murray will play Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France in the other semifinal after both later won four-set matches. World number one Djokovic had reached this stage of a grand slam for the ninth successive time, with only Federer, Rod Laver and Ivan Lendl surpassing that record. He recovered from a slow start, dropping his opening service game, to overpower Mayer, helped by a 20-minute rain delay out on Court One. When he returned he broke for a second time to take the opening set and two further breaks saw him with a two set lead. The third set followed a similar pattern as the 25-year-old Serbian produced a string of winners and he took a 5-4 lead before serving out for victory. Djokovic has beaten Federer in their last three meetings, but the Swiss maestro was even more impressive in seeing off Youzhny on Centre Court, never allowing his opponent the chance to get a foothold in the match. \u201cIt is interesting that this is our first grass-court match. I\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d the 30-year-old Federer said of what will be a record 32nd grand slam semifinal appearance, surpassing Jimmy Connors\u2019 total.  \u201cIt\u2019s been a good tournament so far for me. I\u2019m happy I\u2019m feeling good again. It gives me confidence going into a big match against Novak.\u201d  Djokovic is fully aware of the challenge posed by Federer, who is one week short of Pete Sampras\u2019 career record of 286 at the top of the world rankings. \u201cHe is a great champion and has been so dominant and consistent at the grand slams. He is the ultimate challenge on grass courts.\u201d Djokovic is bidding to become the first man since Federer in 2007 to retain the Wimbledon title, and also add to his Australian Open success earlier this year. World No. 4 Murray kept fans on Centre Court on tenterhooks for nearly four hours before he got past Spanish seventh seed David Ferrer. Ferrer took a set lead and was a break up in the second before his Scottish opponent established a toehold in the match. He trailed 5-2 in the second set tiebreaker before hitting back to level and moved ahead when he took the third set. A brief rain delay halted play at 5-5 in the fourth set before fourth seed Murray returned to win the match 6-7 7-6 6-4 7-6. It will be his fourth Wimbledon straight semifinal, bidding to become the first British player to win a grand slam since Fred Perry in 1936. Tsonga will provide stiff opposition but he was extended by German Philipp Kohlschreiber in their clash on Court One. After dropping the second set, Tsonga, who beat Federer in the quarterfinals last year, emerged a 7-6 4-6 7-6 6-2 winner.  "

Juan Maria Mugica Dorronsoro is wanted in Spain, where he is accused of plotting a missile attack against former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar in 2001.  Mugica had fled when Spanish Civil Guards were on an anti-terror operation in Lizarza, in Spain\u2019s northern Basque region, in January 2010, the Spanish Interior Ministry said. At that time, the Civil Guards broke up an ETA supply and transport cell, which had been ordered in 2001 to attack Aznar with missiles, the ministry note said. Mugica was arrested near the city of Pau in southwestern France. Listed as a terrorist organization by Spain, the United States and the European Union, ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its decades-long fight for an independent Basque state that it wants carved out of sections of northern Spain and southwestern France. Last year, ETA announced \u201ca definitive cessation of its armed activity,\u201d raising hopes that decades of separatist violence may finally be over.

Sarkozy was not present during the raid, having left Monday for a family vacation in Canada, according to his attorney, Thierry Herzog.  The investigation of the former leader has largely centered around whether L\u2019Or\u00e9al cosmetics heiress Liliane Bettencourt and her staff illegally helped Sarkozy during his 2007 presidential campaign.   Related: L\u2019Oreal heiress placed under guardianship The Bettencourt scandal has fascinated France since questions about the finances of France\u2019s richest woman emerged last year amid a family feud. \u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise,\u201d said Christian Mallard, a senior foreign analyst for France Television, said of the developments. After losing his re-election bid to Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Sarkozy \u201cwas going to lose his diplomatic immunity,\u201d opening him up to potential prosecution, Mallard said.   Among the matters probed by investigators were allegations that secret, possibly illegal payments were made to French politicians, including Sarkozy; Eric Woerth, his former labor minister; and members of his party, the Union for a Popular Movement, known as UMP.  \u201cThis search, as expected, proved to be futile given that all required elements had been sent to the magistrate (Jean-Michel Gentil) a fortnight ago,\u201d Herzog said. \u201cIndeed, on June 15, I addressed a letter to the instructing magistrate in which I had attached the certified extracts pertaining to Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s agenda for the entire year in 2007, demonstrating therefore the absolute impossibility of alleged \u2018secret meetings\u2019 with Mrs. Liliane Bettencourt.\u201d In September \u2013 when Sarkozy was still president \u2013 three investigators engaged in an hourlong search of his political party headquarters, seeking documents linking Sarkozy\u2019s campaign to the alleged political contributions from Bettencourt.  \u201cWe have nothing to hide,\u201d the UMP\u2019s Eric Cesari said at the time, adding that investigators left without taking anything. From the archives: Investigators search Sarkozy party HQ in Bettencourt case In May, Sarkozy lost his re-election bid to Hollande, who campaigned for growth and spending and a reversal of Sarkozy\u2019s policies. The election results were thought to signal a French shift to the left, bolstering Hollande\u2019s position to push through an anti-austerity agenda after years of government budget cuts.

Williams won her last Wimbledon crown in 2010 but the No. 6 seed looked in good touch as she triumphed over her Czech opponent 6-3 7-5 in a little under an hour-and-a-half. The 30-year-old will now face Australian Open winner Victoria Azarenka after the No. 2 seed from Belarus beat unseeded Austrian Tamira Paszek. In the top half of the draw, Angelique Kerber beat fellow German Sabine Lisicki 6-3 6-7 7-5 to book her first ever Wimbledon semifinal.

But of those who are left in the tournament, Williams is by far the most experienced having triumphed at the All England Club in 2002, 2003, 2009 and 2010. \u201cIt feels like a good win,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was about dethroning the champion or just going out there and doing the best that I could. \u201cYou can\u2019t play a defending Wimbledon champion or Grand Slam champion and not elevate your game. I had to weed out the riffraff and get serious. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to defend your first Grand Slam title, either. I think when I defended my first one I didn\u2019t win \u2013 but she did great. She held herself in ultimate class and played her heart out. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen her play that well.\u201d It is only the second time Williams has reached the last four of a Grand Slam since her Wimbledon triumph two years ago. But it was her third win in a row against Kvitova, who secured her maiden major title in London last year.  Despite her performance, Serena said she\u2019d need to up her game if she were to take a fifth crown. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to if I want to win the title.

Kvitova pointed to Serena\u2019s formidable serve as the major deciding factor with Williams winning 86% of those points. \u201cI think it was a great match from both of us, and I think she just served much better than I did,\u201d Kvitova said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I played badly, I think she just served very well. In the last game it looked like she did almost four aces. \u201cUnfortunately I have to leave this tournament in the quarters, but I know I have a lot to build on, and I can be stronger and I can improve everything in my game going forward. I\u2019m looking forward to playing the Olympics here.\u201d Azarenka and Paszek\u2019s match was also delayed by bad weather but the Belarusian edged through, setting up a clash with Serena. \u201cIt was a close match it was a lot of long rallies so it was difficult but I\u2019m glad I could manage to win,\u201d she was quoted as saying by Wimbledon\u2019s official website. \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling to be in the semi-final of a Grand Slam but I still want to go all the way and it seems so far away! There\u2019s no better opponent than Serena in a Grand Slam semifinal so I\u2019m really looking forward to that match.\u201d"

        "content": "Built on a disused World War II airfield, Silverstone has come a long way since Stirling Moss first raced there around oil drums and hay bales more than 60 years ago. The iconic English circuit has become more than just a venue \u2013 it represents the rich past of British motor racing and is the key to its Formula One future \u2013 though Moss still hankers over the track\u2019s old curves and straights which have now been revamped. \u201cI liked it as an airfield, I must be honest,\u201d Moss, who made his Silverstone debut in 1948, told CNN.   Britain has had a race on the Formula One calendar since the championship began in 1950.  Silverstone staged it along with Brands Hatch and Aintree before taking it on fulltime from 1987. In the past decade, however, there has been a real danger that the event would be dropped amid public wrangles over money and accusations of a lack of development by F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone. In 2008 he announced that English rival Donington would take over the race in a decade-long deal, but that collapsed a year later due to lack of funding. Silverstone stepped back into the breach to secure a 17-year contract from 2010, as its owner \u2013 the British Racing Drivers\u2019 Club \u2013 announced a new layout that would welcome motorcycling\u2019s elite division, MotoGP. Last year the new Silverstone Wing was unveiled, a \u00a328 million ($44 million) pit and paddock complex. \u201cI think now it\u2019s a very sophisticated one, but what was essential was getting Bernie Ecclestone\u2019s agreement that we could have a long license so we can be sure of keeping the British Grand Prix where it really belongs, at the heart of Silverstone,\u201d said Moss, who competed in F1 from 1951-61. His only two victories in his home race both came at Aintree, while he frequently failed to complete the distance at Silverstone. \u201cOne of the reasons I entered motor racing was because it was dangerous,\u201d said the 82-year-old, whose competitive career ended after an accident before the start of the 1962 F1 season.   \u201cSilverstone was one of the really fast circuits. You didn\u2019t get hairpins and all that stuff to mess around with. To win the British Grand Prix \u2013 and for so many years the European Grand Prix \u2013 it carries quite a lot of kudos.\u201d Moss\u2019 1957 win, shared with Tony Brooks, was the second occasion the British race had the honorary \u201cEuropean\u201d title. James Hunt\u2019s 1977 victory was the last before it became a standalone event, which is now staged in Valencia. Cars these days are slick, safe machines which still top 200 mph despite speed restrictions. Driver safety is now paramount, following years of driver deaths before improvements were made in the 1970s. But back In 1948, motorsport was altogether scarier as the drivers raced around part of the perimeter track, up the two former runways head-on and then back to the perimeter. \u201cYou were sitting very, very low, and seeing where the circuit went wasn\u2019t that easy at the time,\u201d added Moss. \u201cYou had to designate where the circuit was or what part of the circuit you should be on, therefore there were oil drums and straw bales put around \u2013 which, of course, then people would occasionally hit and spin off!\u201d Watch Stirling Moss recall Silverstone\u2019s past In the 1950s and \u201960s, raised earth banks were built up to give spectators a better and safer view as the straw bales and drums were packed away. \u201cIn 1990 they did a tremendous amount of revision to the circuit, to make it a bit more sophisticated, a more technical circuit,\u201d Moss said.   \u201cI\u2019m not sure I would have liked it, but I\u2019d stopped by then so it didn\u2019t matter to me too much!\u201d In 1991, British driver Nigel Mansell won the race, from pole position, for the third of four times. He famously gave rival Ayrton Senna a ride back to the pits after the Brazilian ran out of fuel on the final lap. That year Mansell was second in the championship for the third occasion, but went one better in 1992 as he again triumphed at Silverstone for Williams. \u201cNigel Mansell\u2019s success there was quite a step forward,\u201d Moss said. \u201cNigel\u2019s quite a showman as well \u2013 didn\u2019t he get off from his lap and kiss the ground or something? \u2013 which all adds a bit of a glow to the place.\u201d This weekend Britain\u2019s hopes lay with McLaren\u2019s former world champions Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button, while Paul Di Resta is an outsider with Force India. \u201cThe British Grand Prix is special because I get a massive boost from all the fans,\u201d Hamilton told reporters.  \u201cTo me, winning at Silverstone is right up there with winning at Monaco. Standing on the top step of the podium in 2008 was among the sweetest moments of my career.\u201d Button\u2019s best finish in his home race is fourth, but the Englishman is struggling to regain the form that won him the world title in 2009 and saw him finish second overall last year. \u201cI always enjoy racing at home because the atmosphere is unbeatable, and while the race itself hasn\u2019t always been too kind to me, I come here every year knowing I can count on the support of the many thousands of fans,\u201d he said."

The Spanish racer, one of only two female drivers involved in the sport, was in Britain driving the Marussia team\u2019s MR-01 car for the first time when she struck a stationary truck. Emergency medical charity Magpas confirmed it had treated a woman in her 30s after a slow-speed Formula One crash at Duxford in the county of Cambridgeshire. A later statement from Marussia confirmed De Villota had received hospital treatment and the tests were still being conducted on her at  Addenbrookes Hospital. \u201cSince Maria\u2019s arrival at the hospital at approximately 1045 BST, she has been receiving the best medical attention possible at the hospital, which is the region\u2019s major trauma centre,\u201d said the Russian-owned team.  \u201cMaria is conscious and medical assessments are ongoing. The team will await the outcome of these assessments before providing further comment. \u201cThe team\u2019s first priority at this time is Maria and her family.\u201d Earlier in the day, Marussia had said: \u201cAt approximately 0915 this morning, Maria De Villota had an accident in the team\u2019s MR-01 race car at Duxford Airfield where she was testing the car for the first time. \u201cThe accident happened at the end of her first installation run and involved an impact with the team\u2019s support truck. Maria has been transferred to hospital. Once her medical condition has been assessed a further statement will be issued.\u201d The 32-year-old Spaniard joined Britain-based Marussia in July, after a career which had included spells in Spanish Formula Three, the Euroseries 3000 and the Daytona 24 Hours. The Madrid-born racer is the daughter of former March team Formula One driver Emilio de Villota. De Villota made her debut behind the wheel of an F1 car when testing for Lotus Renault in August 2011. The only other female driver currently contracted in the elite division of motorsport is Britain\u2019s Susie Wolff, who is a development driver with Williams. "

        "content": "English Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur have confirmed the appointment of former Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas as their new head coach. The 34-year-old lasted just nine months at Tottenham\u2019s London rivals, and was sacked in March after a run of disappointing results left them languishing in sixth place in the league. Prior to his spell at Stamford Bridge Villas-Boas enjoyed a record-breaking first season at Portuguese club Porto, winning a domestic double as well as the Europa League. He replaces Harry Redknapp who was dismissed by Tottenham three weeks ago. \u201cTottenham Hotspur is a great club with a strong tradition and fantastic support, both at home and throughout the world,\u201d Villas-Boas told the club\u2019s official website. \u201cI feel privileged to be its coach.  For me, this is one of the most exciting coaching positions in the Premier League.   \u201cI have had several discussions with the chairman and the board and I share their vision for the future progress of the club.   \u201cThis is a squad any coach would love to work with and together I believe we can bring success in the seasons ahead.\u201d Redknapp guided Tottenham to fourth place in the Premier League last season but the club missed out on European Champions League qualification after Chelsea won the continent\u2019s premier club competition. That triumph, overseen by Villas-Boas\u2019 successor at Stamford Bridge, former player Roberto Di Matteo, meant Chelsea took Tottenham\u2019s place by virtue of being crowned champions. Di Matteo has since been appointed Chelsea\u2019s permanent boss, while Villas-Boas has swapped one London club for another. Tottenham\u2019s chairman Daniel Levy, said of the appointment: \u201cI am delighted that Andre has agreed to become our new Head Coach. \u201cHe has an outstanding reputation for his technical knowledge of the game and for creating well-organized teams capable of playing football in an attractive and attacking style.   \u201cAndre shares our long-term ambitions and ethos of developing players and nurturing young talent, and he will be able to do so now at a new world class Training Centre.\u201d"

        "content": "Andy Murray recorded a double triumph on Tuesday to book his place in the last eight at Wimbledon, over opponent Marin Cilic and the dismal weather in London. After a day punctuated by rain delays on Monday, Murray was able to wrap up a 7-5 6-2 6-3 victory with just one interruption before damp conditions halted the action on all but Centre Court. Murray will now face Spain\u2019s David Ferrer \u2013 who knocked him out of the recent French Open \u2013 after the Spaniard defeated Juan Del Potro, from Argentina, 6-3 6-2 6-3. British No. 1 Murray said he was relieved to finish his clash against Croatian Cilic after a frustrating Monday in which play was suspended with the score 7-5 3-1. There was criticism of the tournament\u2019s organizers after Murray\u2019s match wasn\u2019t switched to Centre Court, which has a retractable roof, but he told reporters: \u201cI honestly don\u2019t care which court I play on. \u201cIt makes no difference but obviously every player would rather be on Centre Court because you know you are  going to get your match in regardless of the weather. \u201cI don\u2019t think I deserve to play every match on Centre Court. It\u2019s just annoying when the weather is bad. \u201cI haven\u2019t always dealt with rain delays that well in the past, so it\u2019s good experience for me. Probably from now on I will play on Centre so it won\u2019t  be a problem.\u201d Ferrer, the No. 7 seed, breezed through his match on the sheltered showpiece court, defeating 2009 U.S. Open champion Del Potro in just under two hours. He told the ATP Tour\u2019s official website: \u201cToday was one of my best matches [on a grass] court. But I\u2019m not sure if is my best or not. At Wimbledon, there is a lot of wind.  \u201cOn an indoor court, under a roof, it is easier for us to play. The ball does not move and this is more comfortable for us.\u201d Murray and Ferrer were joined in the quarters by German pair Philipp Kohlschreiber and Florian Mayer. Mayer, the No. 31 seed, reached the last eight at Wimbledon for only the second time after he defeated Frenchman Richard Gasquet 6-3 6-1 3-6 6-2.  His reward for reaching his first quarterfinal in eight years is a tie with world No. 1 and defending champion Novak Djokovic. \u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievable feeling. Eight years ago I was here in the quarters, and now eight years later it\u2019s happened again. So it\u2019s a wonderful dream for me,\u201d Mayer told reporters. Kohlschreiber battled past U.S. qualifier Brian Baker 6-1 7-6 6-3 to make the last eight of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time in 33 attempts.  The No. 27 seed will now play French No. 5 seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga after he recorded a 4-6 7-6 6-4 6-4 win over American No.10 Mardy Fish in another rain-hit match. \u201cI\u2019m very, very happy,\u201d said Kohlschreiber. \u201cIt\u2019s very tough to describe the real feelings. I\u2019m very happy how I played.  \u201cAlso, lucky, at the end, with the weather, that I could finish my match. It\u2019s just an amazing feeling. For sure I will celebrate. I have a lot of confidence now. I like the courts.\u201d The last quarterfinal sees 16-time major champion Roger Federer, the No. 3 seed, take on Russia\u2019s Mikhail Youzhny."

        "content": "Four scuba divers drowned after a routine trip to a popular underwater cave system in southern Italy went horribly wrong over the weekend, according to the coast guard. The party of divers lost their way while trying to find the exit from the \u201cBlood Grotto,\u201d a red-walled cave near the tourist port of Palinuro on Italy\u2019s southwest coast on Saturday.  The divers became disoriented after kicking up mud and sand from the floor while trying to find a way out \u2013 and instead entered a nearby tunnel which led four of the divers to a dead end, where the coast guard says their bodies were found. Massimo Ruggiero, the coast guard commander, confirmed to CNN that the victims were Greek-born Panaiotis Telios, British-born Douglas Rizzo, and Susy Covaccini and Andrea Pedroni, both from Rome. An Italian public prosecutor has ordered an investigation into the accident, and the equipment used by the divers was checked for faults. Marco Sebastiani, one of the dive\u2019s five survivors, said by the time he realized the party was heading the wrong way, it was too late. \u201cAll of a sudden the guide started to panic \u2026 I knew something was wrong but at that point we had already entered the cave and we were going in even further. I tried to take control but it was too late,\u201d Sebastiani told Italy\u2019s Il Messaggero newspaper. Sebastiani, who owns a diving school in Rome, said: \u201cWe suddenly found ourselves in a blind tunnel. We couldn\u2019t see anything. At that point it was panic. The agitation of the least experienced took hold. Mud and sand came up from the bottom of the cave and visibility was gone.\u201d  \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find the exit. At a certain point I managed to find my way. I took as many people as I could with me and we swam towards the light, which grew bigger all the time. When I came up, I looked around to count us and I realised that Susy, Andrea, Douglas and Panos weren\u2019t there. I dove back in and went looking for them but I couldn\u2019t see them. Then my tank ran out of oxygen.\u201d   The Blood Grotto and other submerged caves on Palinuro\u2019s coast are popular destinations for amateur divers \u2013 and the Cilento and Vallo di Diano National Park the caves belong to is a UNESCO World Heritage site."

        "content": "Coal slag heaps up to 450-feet high may not seem the obvious candidates to join a list that includes the pyramids of Egypt, the Great Wall of China, and Yellowstone National Park. But the remnants of a once-thriving mining industry in northern France have now been included in a roll call of the world\u2019s greatest landmarks. The Nord-Pas de Calais Mining Basin has been designated a World Heritage site by the U.N.\u2019s cultural organization, UNESCO, and is now ranked alongside nearly 1,000 sites across the globe considered to have outstanding value. Coal was extracted from the region from the 17th to the 20th century, when it suffered an economic slump. Now, after a 10-year campaign, locals are aiming to promote as tourist attractions the old pits, railway stations, workers\u2019 estates and mining villages. \u201cIt\u2019s important as a piece of history in that part of the world,\u201d said UNESCO spokesperson Susan Williams. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be pretty\u2026 but it does have to be of outstanding universal value, in other words important for the whole of humanity. The locals have been so excited about this. This is a site they are very appreciative of,\u201d she said. In its summary, UNESCO said the mining region was a \u201cremarkable cultural landscape\u201d and provided \u201cexceptional testimony to the exchange of ideas and influences regarding the extraction methods used for underground coal seams, the design of worker housing and urban planning, as well as the international human migration that accompanied the industrialization of Europe.\u201d  The Word Heritage Committee meets once a year to implement the convention defining the kind of natural of cultural sites that can be considered for the prestigious list. The Calais basin is one of three mining sites that made the list this year. Among the 26 additions for 2012 were the Lakes of Ounianga in Chad, Africa, the Chengjiang fossil site in the Yunnan province of China, the decorated farmhouses of Halsingland in Sweden and the Margravial Opera House at Bayreuth in Germany. Nominations for heritage status have to meet the UNESCO criteria agreed by member states and come up with a long-term management plan before they can be scrutinized and judged. However, heritage status does not necessarily guarantee protection.  UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova said news that mausoleums in Timbuktu, Mali, had been destroyed by Islamic militants was \u201cextremely distressing\u201d and called on all parties involved in the conflict to \u201cprotect this invaluable cultural heritage for future generations.\u201d In 2001 the Taliban destroyed part of another of the world\u2019s treasures \u2013 the huge Buddha statues in the Bamiyan Valley on the ancient Silk Road in Afghanistan. Both of these sites are included on a list of 38 sites that are threatened. "

        "content": "A worrying back problem and the damp British weather were not enough to stop Roger Federer marching into a 33rd successive grand slam quarterfinal on Monday. The 16-time major winner kept alive his hopes of joining Pete Sampras on seven Wimbledon successes after beating another tennis veteran Xavier Malisse 7-6 (7-1) 6-1 4-6 6-3 for the 850th victory of his illustrious career. Federer, who had to come from two sets down to defeat fellow 30-year-old Julien Benneteau on Friday, needed to call for a medical timeout to receive painkillers at 4-3 up in the opener. \u201cI was in a lot of pain. The treatment and the painkillers worked. I started to feel better as the  match went on,\u201d said the Swiss, who will next play another 30-year-old, Russian 26th seed Mikhail Youzhny. \u201cIt was a shock for it to happen in the first set of a grand slam when you have to play five on grass. I thought I was in big trouble at 5-6 and he was serving for the first set. I apologized to Xavier for having to go off, but it was just a freak thing.\u201d The cool, wet conditions didn\u2019t help Federer\u2019s back, but he said he was glad that the Centre Court roof was not closed before he completed his win over the Belgian. \u201cI was happy they kept it open because it is an outdoor tournament at the end of the day. We don\u2019t want to play indoors all the time,\u201d he said after extending his record against 2002 semifinalist Malisse to 10-1.  \u201cIt\u2019s not that big of a deal coming on and off. To see the referee coming out and inspecting the courts, that\u2019s the whole drama that belongs to Wimbledon. Eventually, if it\u2019s too bad and it\u2019s really raining, this is when you shut it.\u201d Youzhny had previously reached the fourth round on six occasions, including last year, but but went one step further this time as he beat Uzbekistan\u2019s Denis Istomin in a five-set match lasting more than four hours. If third seed Federer gets past Youzhny, then he will next face world No. 1 Novak Djokovic, who beat fellow Serbian Viktor Troicki 6-3 6-1 6-3 on Centre Court later Monday. It was the friends\u2019 first meeting on grass, but defending champion Djokovic had no problems posting his 12th successive win over the 34th-ranked Troicki \u2013 who might be his doubles partner at the London Olympics \u2013 to reach his 13th consecutive major quarterfinal. The 25-year-old will next face the winner of the match between French 18th seed Richard Gasquet or No. 31 Florian Mayer of Germany, who led 6-3 2-1 when play was halted earlier in the day on Court Three. British fourth seed Andy Murray had won the first set to lead his last-16 clash with Croatia\u2019s Marin Cilic 7-5 3-1 when rain halted play on Court One, while France\u2019s world No. 5 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga lost his opening set against Mardy Fish as the American led 6-4 1-1 on Court Two.  The three delayed matches will resume on Tuesday, along with the two last-16 tiers that did not even start: Spanish seventh seed David Ferrer against  Argentina\u2019s No. 9 Juan Martin del Potro, and unseeded American Brian Baker versus No. 27 Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany."

        "content": "Andres Iniesta did not feature in the contenders for the best player of the 2010 World Cup despite scoring Spain\u2019s winning goal in the final, but the midfielder has been recognized  for his country\u2019s historic triumph at Euro 2012. The 28-year-old Barcelona star is one of 10 Spanish players in UEFA\u2019s 23-man squad, which features four from losing finalists Italy. Iniesta, clubmates Xavi Hernandez and Sergio Buesquets plus Real Madrid\u2019s Xabi Alonso were included in a nine-strong midfield contingent, while David Silva and Cesc Fabregas were named among five forwards despite playing in Spain\u2019s so-called \u201cno striker\u201d formation. The Spaniards completely nullified Italy\u2019s midfield general Andrea Pirlo in Sunday\u2019s final, winning 4-0 in Kiev to clinch a third successive major title.  Iniesta did not score and had just one assist, but was rewarded for his overall contribution to the merciless Spanish passing machine. At the 2010 World Cup, David Villa was Spain\u2019s only entry in the top three as Uruguay\u2019s Diego Forlan was named best player. \u201cPirlo was magnificent and obviously circumstances didn\u2019t help him in the final,\u201d UEFA technical director Andy Roxburgh said.  \u201cXabi Alonso, Xavi Hernandez and Iniesta were all superb. In the case of Xavi, he won the award last time, and he could easily have won the award again, but we felt that Iniesta deserved it.  Is this Spain team the best in football history? \u201cIn many ways, he symbolized the tournament \u2013 the creative, incisive runner, with and without the ball. We felt that he epitomized a lot of what we saw.\u201d The squad included only two players not present in the semifinal matches: England captain Steven Gerrard and Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. \u201cThe players in the squad are those who have contributed in a significant way over the entire tournament,\u201d said Roxburgh, a former coach of Scotland\u2019s national team.  \u201cInevitably, the squad is dominated by players from the teams who had the most success \u2013 first of all the team which won the title, Spain, then those players who were in the other top three teams. \u201cThere are other players who could easily have been in the squad, but we restricted ourselves to a set number. The line was drawn at 23 because this was the squad size for the tournament.\u201d UEFA president Michel Platini hailed the tournament in Poland and Ukraine as a big success, despite earlier fears of problems with racism which \u2013 despite several incidents inside stadiums \u2013 did not escalate as predicted. \u201cThis Euro, the first in the East, has been a resounding success, a real triumph,\u201d the Frenchman said on UEFA\u2019s website.  \u201cPoland and Ukraine showed the whole world that they can organize this type of event and that they needn\u2019t have any concerns. They can be proud of the work they\u2019ve done, their enthusiasm and the final results. I\u2019m proud of them, anyway.\u201d Platini said the biggest on-pitch success of the tournament was the use of extra match officials behind the goal lines. \u201cThat was the principal innovation on the pitch compared to previous Euro editions, and the system of five referees was a real plus in terms of the football that got played: it helped get rid of simulation in the area and also helped significantly reduce shirt-pulling during set pieces,\u201d he said.  \u201cIn the end, there were more goals and, even more significantly, more headed goals in this Euro than in other big international competitions. That\u2019s no coincidence. The system of five referees acts as a deterrent and the quality of football benefits from that.\u201d UEFA also raised \u20ac228,000 ($285,000) for the charity Center for Access to Football in Europe (CAFE) after pledging \u20ac3,000 for each of the 76 goals scored. Off the field of play, Internet users set a new record for a sporting event on Twitter during Sunday\u2019s final. The social networking site said its total global traffic peaked at 15,358 tweets per second when Juan Mata scored Spain\u2019s fourth goal. The match brought in 16.5 million tweets in total. UEFA\u2019s team of Euro 2012: Goalkeepers: Gianluigi Buffon (Italy), Iker Casillas (Spain), Manuel Neuer (Germany). Defenders: Gerard Pique (Spain), Fabio Coentrao (Portugal), Philipp Lahm (Germany), Pepe (Portugal), Sergio Ramos (Spain), Jordi Alba (Spain).

        "content": "Maria Sharapova\u2019s bid to end her long wait for a second Wimbledon crown came crashing to a halt on Monday, while Kim Clijsters\u2019 final appearance at the grass-court grand slam also finished in round four. World No. 1 Sharapova lost her rematch with Sabine Lisicki, who she beat in last year\u2019s semifinals before losing the title match. Sharapova won the event as a 17-year-old in 2004 to announce herself as a new star in women\u2019s tennis, but the defeat by Petra Kvitova 12 months ago is the closest she has come to a repeat success in London. German 15th seed Lisicki powered past her Russian opponent to win 6-4 6-3 and set up a last-eight clash with eighth-seeded compatriot Angelique Kerber, who thrashed former No. 1 Clijsters 6-1 6-1 in just 49 minutes. It is the first time that two German women have made it to the second week of the tournament since 1995, when Steffi Graf won the title for the sixth time and Anke Huber lost in round four. \u201cIt\u2019s just unbelievable. I\u2019m so happy. I had lost the last three meetings with her, so it\u2019s nice to finally win one,\u201d said Lisicki, who had lost five matches in a row coming into Wimbledon, including a first-round defeat at the French Open. \u201cI just went for my shots out there. I felt great, it\u2019s my favorite  tournament. I love the crowd and playing on grass. I\u2019m a fighter and I fight to the last game. I think I\u2019m getting better with  each match.\u201d Sharapova, who won the French Open last month after losing in January\u2019s Australian Open final, struggled after going 3-1 down in the opening set and a 45-minute rain delay did not help her get back into rhythm. \u201cShe did many things better than I did. She played very well,\u201d said Sharapova, who saved two match-points.  \u201cI could have done things differently but not on this  particular day.\u201d Four-time grand slam champion Clijsters, who has never got past the semifinals at Wimbledon, could not get going against Kerber \u2013 who fired 19 winners to 10, and just five unforced errors to the Belgian\u2019s 13. Clijsters, 29, will retire for the second time following September\u2019s U.S. Open, a tournament she has won three times. \u201cI think the first year that I played here, I was here just to take it all in. I don\u2019t even think I was here to play tennis. I needed to just open my eyes and look at everything,\u201d Clijsters said of her first Wimbledon appearance in 1999.  \u201cIt was such an amazing thing. To me this was like Disneyland to another child. It was such a beautiful thing.\u201d In the other half of the Wimbledon draw, four-time winner Serena Williams will face defending champion Petra Kvitova in the quarterfinals after both battled through with three-set victories. Williams, seeking her first grand slam title since 2010, triumphed 6-1 2-6 7-5 against Kazakhstani Yaroslava Shvedova out on Court Two. Shvedova won a record 24 points out of 24 in her first set against French Open runnerup Sara Errani on Saturday, but made a poor start in windy conditions before battling back to level. Williams, bouncing back from her first-round exit at Roland Garros, hit 35 winners to 24, and made 13 unforced errors to her opponent\u2019s 20. \u201cThe bottom line is I can play so much better than I am. If I couldn\u2019t do better that would be a problem,\u201d Williams said.  World No.4 Kvitova has never beaten the American sixth seed, losing both meetings in 2010 at the Australian Open and then the Wimbledon semifinals. The Czech left-hander came from behind against 2010 French Open champion Francesca Schiavone as she beat the Italian 4-6 7-5 6-1. Schiavone, at 32 the oldest player left in the draw, paid for her 13 double faults and struggled to keep her cool after slipping on the wet grass at the end of the second set. World No. 37 Tamira Paszek reached the quarterfinals for the second year in a row, beating Italian 21st seed Roberta Vinci 6-2 6-2. The 21-year-old Austrian, who has lost in the first round of five of her last six grand slam appearances, will next face second seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus. Australian Open champion Azarenka was unaffected by a rain break as the roof was closed on Centre Court as she demolished Serbia\u2019s Ana Ivanovic 6-1 6-0 in a battle of former world No. 1s. Polish third seed Agnieszka Radwanska will feature in the quartefinals for the first time since 2009 after beating 20-year-old Italian qualifier Camila Giorgi 6-2 6-3. Radwanska, 23, who also reached the last eight in 2008, will next play Russian 17th seed Maria Kirilenko \u2013 who beat China\u2019s No. 30 Peng Shuai  6-1 6-7 (8-6) 6-3. Kirilenko\u2019s only other grand slam quarterfinal appearance was at the 2010 Australian Open, while Peng is yet to get that far in singles play."

        "content": "Tiger Woods overtook Jack Nicklaus for second place on the all-time PGA Tour list as he claimed the AT&T National at Congressional Sunday. It was his 74th victory and he needs eight more to draw level with Sam Snead. The two-shot win over nearest challenger Bo Van Pelt also leaves him in fine fettle heading into the third major of the season at Royal Lytham and St Annes later this month. Woods is four short of leader Nicklaus on that all-time list but has not won a major since the 2008 U.S. Open after his career stalled through injury and well chronicled problems in his personal life. In extra preparation for his tilt at a 15th major at Lytham, Woods has added the Greenbrier Classic, which starts Thursday, to his schedule. The Greenbrier course in West Virginia is closely associated with Snead, who lived in the area and Woods said he was \u201cexcited\u201d about the prospect of claiming a fourth win this season to draw nearer to the legendary golfer. Tiger gives chase at storm-hit Congressional But then he will hone his preparations for Lytham and told gathered reporters after his Congressional win that he faced a testing challenge on the seaside links in northern England. \u201cI will be practicing some different shots, I will need to hit the ball a bit lower, more flighted,\u201d he said. But after his final round two-under 69 at Congressional for an eight-under 276 total, Woods was in buoyant and defiant mood. \u201cWhat an incredible week,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember there was a time, about six months ago, when people were saying I could never win  again.\u201d Victories at Bay Hill and Muirfield Village ended that long drought and his game held up well under pressure after a storm-hit AT&T, which had to be played Saturday without spectators because of safety fears. \u201cYesterday was a silent day, but I think everyone saved it up for today,\u201d  said Woods, who had the added pressure of being the tournament host in Maryland. Van Pelt, who mounted a stiff challenge, is in no doubt that Woods is back to his formidable best.   \u201cI think he\u2019s the only guy to win three tournaments on tour this year \u2013 on  three different golf courses,\u201d Van Pelt said. \u201cAnd he was leading the US Open after two days. So I\u2019d say that he\u2019s playing the best golf in the world right  now.\u201d Australia\u2019s Adam Scott finished in third place at five-under-par 279.  "

        "content": "Defending champions Spain claimed an historic third successive major international trophy with a 4-0 rout of Italy in the Euro 2012 final in Kiev Sunday. It was a breathtaking display from the 2010 World Cup winners, with victory all but sealed by halftime as goals from David Silva and Jordi Alba gave them a 2-0 lead.   Substitutes Fernando Torres and Juan Mata rounded off the emphatic win with two late strikes.   Victory in the final also represents a triumph for 61-year-old coach Vicente Del Bosque, the first man to lead teams to the World Cup, European Championships and European Champions League crowns, the latter with Real Madrid in 2000 and 2002. \u201cThis success in Spanish football is something historic, and now we have to look to the future and try to qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil,\u201d he told gathered reporters. But for Italy and their coach Cesare Prandelli it was a bitter end to a tournament which they had earlier graced with their imaginative performances. \u201cWe came up against a terrific side,\u201d Prandelli admitted.  Euro 2012 LIVE: Spain vs Italy La Roja shone brightly from the start and with a cutting edge, despite again starting the match without a recognized striker. Barcelona\u2019s Xavi Hernandez brushed the crossbar with a fierce shot in the 10th minute after dazzling interplay but it did not take long for the pressure to pay off. Xavi\u2019s club teammate Andres Iniesta threaded a perfect pass through for Cesc Fabregas to cross for David Silva to head home on 14 minutes. Italy, who caused such a shock with a 2-1 win over Germany in the semifinals, responded with a pair of Antonio Cassano efforts, but with Mario Balotelli unable to make much impression they always looked second best. Spain went further ahead just before halftime and the goal was typical off their all round teamwork. Defender Jordi Alba exchanged passes with Xavi and burst through the center of the Italian defense before easily beating Gianluigi Buffon. After the break, Italy responded with a pair of chances for Antonio di Natali, the first a header, the second with a clearer sight of goal only to be denied twice in quick succession by Spain captain Iker Casillas. Italian hopes of a comeback took a further dent when their final substitute, Thiago Motta, lasted only five minutes before being stretchered off. Against a tiring team with only 10 men, Spain eventually took full advantage after the introduction of Chelsea\u2019s Torres. Xavi found him with another superb pass and he slotted home the third on 84 minutes, becoming the first man to score in two successive European Championship finals.  He had grabbed the only goal of the 2008 final win over Germany. Torres then cleverly set up his club teammate Mata to score with virtually his first touch of the ball. In doing so, Torres clinched the tournament\u2019s Golden Boot for his joint leading three goals and that final assist. It left Casillas to lift the trophy in the magnificent Olympic Stadium, the Real Madrid goalkeeper reveling in yet another showpiece triumph for a team many are calling the greatest in history.   \u201cThis is such a truly wonderful moment. The second goal from Jordi (Alba) clinched it really,\u201d he told Telecinco television. \u201cIt\u2019s been four marvelous years. You might think that a 4-0 margin against  Italy means it was easy \u2013 but we have been gradually stepping up as the  tournament went along.\u201d Sunday\u2019s final set the seal on three weeks of competition in Ukraine and Poland at eight match venues and involving 16 teams. Twenty four national sides will take their place in the next finals in France in 2016 and they will do well to match the overall high standard of attacking play in Euro 2012. Incidents of racist chanting and violent clashes between supporters from Poland and Russia marred the group stages, but fears of widespread fan violence proved just fears. Ukraine\u2019s alleged mistreatment of jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko also led to threats of a boycott by European political leaders, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel attended their quarterfinal victory over Greece. Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rayoy were guests at the final, a welcome distraction perhaps from the economic turmoil engulfing their austerity-hit countries in the Eurozone crisis. More controversially, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko was also among the dignitaries,  despite being the subject of a European Union travel ban. His invite sparked a protest from a feminist group in Kiev before the final. "

        "content": "Brendon de Jonge is on course for a maiden PGA Tour victory after seizing a one-stroke lead in the third round of the storm-hit AT&T National at the Congressional Country Club in Maryland.  The Zimbabwean posted his second successive round of 69 on Saturday to move to seven-under par, one clear of Tiger Woods and opening-round leader Bo Van Pelt who both shot rounds of 67.  De Jonge and the rest of the field played out their third rounds in an eerily quiet atmosphere after PGA Tour officials ordered spectators to stay away from the course following a severe storm on Friday night.  \u201cAt first it was definitely very strange. Then we kind of got used to it,\u201d De Jonge said.  \u201cJust the no buzz. It was hard to get the adrenaline going, kind of felt like you were playing a Tuesday practice round or a qualifier,\u201d he added. Play was delayed for six hours as ground staff cleared up after Friday night\u2019s winds \u2013 estimated by the PGA Tour to to be in excess of 70 mph (112 kph) \u2013 downed a tree on the 14th fairway and left branches and debris scattered all over the course.  Extreme heat strikes East and Midwest De Jonge continued his steady form once play got underway, with two birdies on the front nine and another at the 12th before a bogey at the par-four 14th checked his progress.  Woods and Van Pelt moved into contention with rounds of 67 while South Korea\u2019s Noh Seung-yul is also one stroke behind after posting a 69 on Saturday.  \u201cIt was amazing we even got it in,\u201d Woods said. \u201cSo that was good. Today I just tried to make a run and fight back to get myself in the tournament.\u201d The 14-time major winner, who last won the event back in 2009, likened the largely spectator-less course to playing in a practice round.  \u201cI\u2019ve played in front of people like this, but not generally for an 18-hole competitive round.\u201d America\u2019s Hunter Mahan (73) and Billy Hurley III \u2013 whose round of 66 was the best of the day \u2013 are two shots off the lead on five-under par.    Venezuela\u2019s Jhonattan Vegas is three shots adrift of De Jonge after completing a round of 68.    \u201cWinning here would be that much more special. It\u2019s obviously a great tournament with a great field, so that would be a good feather in your cap. But obviously I\u2019ve got a lot of work to do tomorrow,\u201d De Jonge said.  Meanwhile on the European Tour, Jamie Donaldson is also closing in on a first win at the Irish Open at Royal Portrush. The 36-year-old Welshman shot a third round 69 on Saturday to finish on 12-under par, one stroke ahead of England\u2019s Anthony Wall.  Ireland\u2019s Padraig Harrington is two shots off the pace after a level-par 72 left him tied for third with England\u2019s Mark Foster. Donaldson is seeking to end a run of 254 starts in Europe without a win.    \u201cI\u2019ve had a few chances, but at the end of the day I\u2019ve not been good enough so far to stand on the last green holding the trophy,\u201d he said, EuropeanTour.com reported.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep trying and it\u2019s one shot at a time, one hole at a time. The only person I am playing against, I suppose, is myself. I\u2019ve got to stay out of my own way,\u201d he added. \u201cObviously Padraig is a class player, but it\u2019s me versus me really.\u201d England\u2019s Paul Waring (73) slipped to fifth on Saturday with a one-over par 73 while Spain\u2019s Rafa Cabrera-Bello and Scotland\u2019s Craig Lee, Fabrizio Zanotti of Paraguay and Denmark\u2019s Thorbjorn Olesen are all a shot further back in sixth place.    Northern Ireland\u2019s Rory McIlroy and Italy\u2019s Francesco Molinari are currently in a 14-way tie for 11th place, six shots off the lead."

        "content": "Jamie Donaldson claimed the first European Tour title of his career with a resounding four-stroke victory at the Irish Open on Sunday.  The Welshman made sure of his first win in 255 attempts with a closing six-under par round of 66 at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland \u2013 the first time the event has taken place north of the border since 1953.    \u201cI guess it takes some people longer than others, and it\u2019s taken me a lot longer than I thought to win,\u201d Donaldson said.  \u201cThe first three years went too quickly and then I was out for a year with injury, so I didn\u2019t find my feet too soon after that, and then I lost my way a bit. But over the last two to three years I feel as though I have been building to this win and it\u2019s just so nice to be finally holding this trophy,\u201d he added. The 36-year-old started his final round trailing Sweden\u2019s Mikael Lundberg who set off at a blistering pace going out in 29 strokes.  But Donaldson immediately set about reclaiming his overnight lead, bagging three birdies in the opening four holes to set the tone for the rest of an assured final round.  A bogey four at the par three 11th hole was followed by birdies at the 12th, 14th and 15th holes.  Another bogey at the 16th failed to unnerve Donaldson who closed out like a champion birdieing the closing two holes to finish the week on 18-under par. Donaldson, who pocketed a winner\u2019s check of \u20ac333,330, finished four shots clear of England\u2019s Anthony Wall, Rafa Cabrera-Bello from Spain and Paraguay\u2019s Fabrizio Zanotti in second.   Wall, who was paired with Donaldson during Sunday\u2019s round, paid tribute to the Welshman afterwards.    \u201cI\u2019ve never doubted him. He\u2019s a class act and a super, super player, and he deserves everything he gets because he does work hard and he\u2019s got loads of talent,\u201d Wall said, EuropeanTour.com reported.  Hopes of an Irish winner faded on Sunday when Padraig Harrington could only manage a closing round of 70 to finish six shots adrift of Donaldson in tie for seventh place with Scotland\u2019s Craig Lee (68) and David Drysdale (66). Rory McIlroy had too much ground to make up on the final day but finished with a bogey-free round of 67 to claim a share of 10th place on 11-under par. "

The 14-time major winner has won the event on four previous occasions, and he showed signs of returning to form after finishing tied for 40th at the Players Championship three weeks ago. \u201cI think I was just consistent all day,\u201d the former world No. 1 told the PGA Tour\u2019s official website after a round which included four birdies. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything great and I didn\u2019t do anything poorly, I was just very consistent.  And I think with the golf course being the way it\u2019s set up, you just have to be that way.\u201d Woods\u2019 score could have been even better had he not dropped two strokes at the par-four 18th hole. \u201cI stuck it in the ground with the five-wood and hit it out to the right and tried to make sure I missed it left coming out of that bunker and overcooked that one,\u201d the 36-year-old said. \u201cThen I got thrown off a little bit out of my rhythm.\u201d But the world No.9 was encouraged by his performance and when he was asked if he was getting back to his best, he replied: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Current world No. 1 Luke Donald, winner of the recent PGA Championship, finished the day one stroke off Woods after also double bogeying the final hole. U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy managed to rescue his round to finish level with his fellow Briton Donald on one-under. The world No. 2, who started his round on the 10th hole, quadruple bogeyed the par-three 12th after finding the water. But the 23-year-old battled back with four birdies and an eagle at the fifth. McIlroy will be hoping for a successful weekend after missing the cut at his last two events \u2013 the Players Championship and the PGA Championship. The 2011 Masters winner Charl Schwartzel carded a 73 to finish one over, with this year\u2019s Augusta champion Bubba Watson one shot further back. Schwartzel\u2019s compatriot and world No. 14 Louis Oosthuizen was also two over after day one, with American Keegan Bradley four over. "

        "content": "Sunday\u2019s showpiece European Championship final in the Ukrainian capital Kiev pits Spain against Italy, between them the winners of the last two World Cups. Spain is on the brink of creating soccer history; never before has a country won three major international football tournaments in a row. And Spain, which won Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup, now has the chance to earn a place in the record books. Before the Euros, former Barcelona and England striker Gary Lineker said \u201cLa Furia Roja,\u201d or the Red Fury as the Spanish national team is called, was just one trophy away from greatness. \u201cIf they won three tournaments in a row, something no other team has done, you would have to put them up there among the all-time greatest teams,\u201d said Lineker, who helped England reach the World Cup semifinals in 1990. Spain reach Euro 2012 final after shootout victory Vicente del Bosque\u2019s side enjoyed huge good fortune in Wednesday\u2019s semifinal against Iberian neighbors Portugal, winning 4-2 in a penalty shootout after a 0-0 draw. Cesc Fabregas scuffed the decisive spot-kick as it hit the inside the post and rolled along the goal line before creeping into Rui Patricio\u2019s net. Fabregas\u2019 penalty can perhaps be seen as a symbol of Spain\u2019s unconvincing performances at Euro 2012 so far, which have left a large proportion of the watching public unsatisfied as the team struggled to break down packed opposition defenses. The end of a love affair? For all their possession (Spain have enjoyed around 67% of the ball in their five matches), there has been frustration that the team has neither moved the ball around quickly enough nor created enough goalscoring chances. Instead, it has worn down the other team by making their players chase shadows before waiting for a mistake. Whisper it quietly, but some have even labeled Spain\u2019s previously much-feted tiki-taka style of play \u201cboring\u201d and claimed it is currently a more defensive tactic than offensive. That argument is perhaps backed up by the fact that Spain has now not conceded a knockout-stage goal in any tournament since the 2006 World Cup, a run of nine matches and a remarkable 900 minutes of action. Against Italy in the group stage and France in the last eight, Del Bosque even picked a starting 11 without a single striker \u2013 a tactic designed to help Spain keep the ball better and lure the opposing defense out so they could get in behind. It hasn\u2019t worked flawlessly, but the team has  churned out results regardless. Beautiful football might be what people demand, but results are what Del Bosque deals in first. Since taking over from previous coach Luis Aragones following Euro 2008, the 61-year-old has led the national team to an incredible 50 wins from 59 matches. Midfielder Andres Iniesta, who scored the winner in the 2010 World Cup final, says Spain isn\u2019t bothered by the \u201cboring\u201d tag. The 27-year-old instead focuses on the positives of the team\u2019s possession-based game. \u201cWhen a team wants to attack and comes up against an opponent that sits back and tries to close the space and not try to create its own chances, that\u2019s not always the football you want to watch,\u201d said Iniesta. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget that only a few years ago this style is what changed the story of Spain.\u201d A change in mentality It is a story that began at Euro 2008 \u2013 and really, truly began with Spain\u2019s quarterfinal penalty shootout victory over Italy in Vienna, a match that defender Gerard Pique looks back on as the turning point. \u201cI think it changed the mentality of the national team,\u201d said the Barcelona star. \u201cBefore, Spain played to avoid losing \u2013 but afterwards they played to win.\u201d Italy was the World Cup champion at the time and the favorite to go through. The team, however, was missing the suspended Andrea Pirlo, who has been in such glorious form at this tournament. Pirlo was also injured at the 2010 World Cup and played only 34 minutes in the team\u2019s final group game as Italy crashed out at the first hurdle following draws with Paraguay and New Zealand and a 3-2 defeat at the hands of Slovakia. But the 33-year-old midfielder is enjoying a stunning renaissance in his career. A year ago, he was discarded by AC Milan after 10 years of service. He signed for Juventus and led \u201cThe Old Lady\u201d to the Italian league title before showcasing the full range of his majestic talents for the world to see in Poland and Ukraine. With hardly a hair out of place and rarely breaking into a sweat, the masterful Pirlo has dictated the knockout matches against England and Germany with breathtaking class, providing an exhibition in how to create space and pass the ball. The master and the maverick When looking long, Pirlo has often sought out Mario Balotelli, the maverick Manchester City striker who is as well known for his controversial lifestyle as his performances on the pitch \u2013 something which may change after his monumental two-goal showing against the much-fancied Germans in the semifinal. Balotelli double sends Italy through to Euro 2012 final Balotelli went into Euro 2012 considered a talented liability, as capable of moments of madness as those of brilliance. But he powered home a header to give Italy the lead and then crashed a stunning second into the top corner from 18 yards. Even German keeper Manuel Neuer had to applaud the 21-year-old\u2019s chutzpah. \u201cTonight was the most beautiful of my life \u2013 but I hope that this Sunday is even better,\u201d said Balotelli after the game. \u201cAlong with Spain, we are the two best teams in the tournament. We are the only side to have scored against Spain so far. We proved that we are equal to them, if not more, and we want to win.\u201d Whoever wins on Sunday, it will provide a fairytale finish to a competition that has surpassed all expectations. Scare stories The buildup to the first major football tournament behind the old Iron Curtain in eastern Europe was dominated by scare stories: the transportation infrastructure wasn\u2019t ready; there weren\u2019t enough affordable hotels for supporters to stay in; racism was a widespread problem in both host countries; foreign fans would not be welcomed in many of the host cities, and so on. Yet most of the fears have been unfounded. Yes, there have been issues with supporters that European football\u2019s governing body UEFA has had to deal with, and member associations have been fined for specific incidents of failing to keep their fans under control. Some of the magnificent stadia have not been full for every game, but that is probably due to the fact that Europe is going through difficult economic times right now and Poland and Ukraine are further away than most host nations have been \u2013 resulting in increased traveling costs. But by and large, Euro 2012 has been an unqualified success. The group stage matches were full of attacking intent and fine goals. And the knockout stages have produced two penalty shootouts of unbearable tension, not to mention Italy\u2019s awesome destruction of Germany. Referees have let games flow and kept the card count down, and players have responded by concentrating more on their football and less on feigning injury and trying to artificially gain their team an advantage. Everywhere you looked, there was a story: Andriy Shevchenko gave Ukraine a memory it will never forget with two goals to see off Sweden; Greece put the country\u2019s vast financial problems aside to qualify from Group A; the much-fancied Netherlands went back home with its tail between its legs; and Spain and Italy quietly worked their way through the tournament. Sensational scoring With 30 of the 31 matches played, we have seen only three red cards \u2013 two of which came in the opening game as Poland drew with Greece. And there have been 21 goals scored from headers, which at 29% of the total 72, stands higher than at any previous Euros. Wonderful goals have crashed in with regularity, from the acrobatics of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Balotelli to the gorgeous flick of Danny Welbeck, the emphatic volleys of Sami Khedira and Marco Reus, to the unstoppable rocket shots of Jakub Blaszczykowski and, again, Balotelli. And then there was Pirlo\u2019s \u201cPanenka.\u201d With England leading Italy 2-1 after the first two penalties in Sunday\u2019s quarterfinal shootout, Pirlo produced a moment of genius to change the momentum entirely in Italy\u2019s favor. He watched the England keeper buzz around on the line trying to put him off, before coolly chipping the ball \u2013 a la Antonin Panenka in the 1976 European Championship final shootout \u2013 delicately into the net after Joe Hart had dived early and erroneously to his right. England missed its next two penalties and Italy triumphed.  \u201cHart seemed to be very confident in himself. I needed to do something to beat him and it seemed to be a psychological blow,\u201d said the unflappable Pirlo.  England boss Roy Hodgson added: \u201cThe cool, calculated way Pirlo chipped it, that is something you either have or you don\u2019t have as a player.\u201d The football world swooned, and Pirlo produced his second successive man-of-the-match display to help Italy slay Germany in the semis and continue the Azzurri\u2019s amazing record of never having lost a competitive game to \u201cDie Mannschaft.\u201d On Sunday, Cesare Prandelli\u2019s team can keep another record intact: that of a country never winning three major international tournaments in a row. Spain are potentially 90 minutes away from sporting immortality. A captivating conclusion to Euro 2012 lies in wait."

The 30-year-old will play unseeded American Christina McHale in round three, after the world No. 35 got the better of compatriot Lauren Davis.

        "content": "If Greece was the focus of markets\u2019 angst last week, attention this week has shifted to the other end of the Mediterranean. Spain\u2019s public finances are nothing like as grim as the Greeks\u2019, but a worsening banking crisis threatens to deepen an already painful recession and endanger the future of the eurozone. The immediate cause of the pain in Spain is the need to recapitalize the country\u2019s fourth-largest bank, Bankia \u2013 itself an unwieldy amalgam of previously-ailing financial institutions.  The bank asked the government for the not inconsiderable sum of  \u20ac19 billion ($23.5 billion) last week. The state has already pumped some \u20ac20 billion into a banking system crippled by bad debt \u2013 much of it property-related.  Getting the Spanish banking system out of intensive care threatens to become a vicious circle. To provide further help, the government will have to issue yet more bonds - worsening its own finances. The yield on Spain\u2019s sovereign 10-year bond has risen to nearly 7%, widely regarded by international markets as unsustainable. Portugal, Greece and Ireland had to seek international bailouts when their borrowing costs reached such levels.  Too big to fail? For the eurozone countries, the situation in Spain is far more daunting than that in Greece. According to some analysts, while it may be deemed \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d it may also be \u201ctoo big to rescue\u201d with the resources available. According to the International Monetary Fund, Greece\u2019s GDP is $271 billion; Spain\u2019s $1,397 billion.  Professor Peter Morici, of the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland, says \u201cSpain could prove beyond Germany and other northern countries\u2019 capacity to rescue, and its collapse would spell the end for the euro.\u201d If Greece was living beyond its means, Spain\u2019s problem stems from a property boom that followed its entry to the EU. Northern Europeans escaping to the Mediterranean beaches fed an orgy of hotel and apartment building. Many of those developments are unfinished skeletons or on sale at foreclosure prices. The banks are loaded up with the consequences of that boom and bust.  Pierpaolo Barbieri, Ernest May Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Belfer Center, says that \u201cbig, international banks like Santander and BVA are well diversified. Of the others, quite a few need capital \u2013 but how much? That\u2019s the unknown and Bankia has undermined faith in financial reporting.\u201d Spain has also become Exhibit A in the fierce debate over whether austerity is actually helping or worsening the situation. Its new conservative government has accentuated public spending cuts \u2013 but those cuts have helped push the country back into recession and destroyed consumer demand \u2013 down one-tenth in the year to April. Morici says: \u201cA terrible negative feedback cycle has been unleashed \u2013 a contracting economy lessens Madrid\u2019s tax revenues, this further engenders investor doubt and even higher interest rates, higher borrowing costs require more spending cuts, and those further worsen economic contraction.\u201d Analysts say that at the heart of Europe\u2019s troubles is the divergence of financial necessity and political will. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso wants \u201can ambitious and structural approach which should include a roadmap and a timetable for a full economic and monetary union in the euro area.\u201d  Bad timing. Neither the states in the eurozone nor those EU members outside the single currency (including the UK) want to invest political capital in closer and expensive integration while voters lose faith with the European project.  A poll by the Pew Research Center published this week showed that Spaniards \u2013 rabidly pro-European a few years ago, now believe by a margin of 50% to 46% that European integration has weakened their country. In Italy the margin is 61% to 22%; in Greece 70% to 18%. Tools of the Trade The European Central Bank has provided banks with cheap credit and bought sovereign debt to try to restrain yields. But economists believe Europe \u2013 currently \u2013 lacks the tools it needs to tackle the current crisis. And above all it needs U.S.-style banking insurance. Morici says that \u201cto discourage bank runs, the eurozone has no analog to the FDIC (the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), which is backed up by the U.S. Treasury\u2019s capacity to tax and sell bonds, and ultimately the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to print money.\u201d Barbieri believes two drastic Europe-wide steps are needed. The first would be to inject capital into Spanish banks at risk \u2013 directly from the European Stability Mechanism, which comes into operation in July. But that might require a change to a treaty already making its way through the parliaments of member states.  The advantage of using the ESM is that \u201cinstead of the Spanish state going to the market and paying 7% on its debt, so that it can then pump money into the banks, the ESM could borrow at 3% or so,\u201d Barbieri says. Then there is what might be called the \u201cNATO principle\u201d \u2013 an attack on one is an attack on all. Creating a European equivalent of the FDIC \u2013 through a banking union \u2013 would pool the eurozone\u2019s insurance to guarantee bank deposits, and thus reassure investors. \u201cRight now Deutsche Bank can attract Spanish savers anxious that their own banks may become insolvent,\u201d says Barbieri. \u201cA European FDIC would put a stop to that damaging dynamic.\u201d And savings are emigrating from Spain at an alarming rate. According to Bank of Spain figures a net \u20ac66 billion ($82 billion) left the country in March, the highest level since records began 22 years ago. But there is plenty of resistance to the idea of a European shield for Spain. The European Commission said Thursday that the Spanish government needed to flesh out its plans to restructure Bankia \u2013 but a European rescue was not envisaged. \u201cThere is great reluctance in Germany to go along with such a plan as it might become a large liability and it could worsen moral hazard in the banking sector,\u201d says Barbieri. \u201cBut the alternative is even worse: if the banking system in Spain goes under, then attention turns to Italy, where one of the largest banks is owned by a French bank \u2013 and so on. The catastrophe could start in the periphery, but it would spread fast and engulf the core soon enough.\u201d Perhaps in the meantime Spain can take comfort from Sancho Panza\u2019s final words of wisdom to Don Quixote: \u201cI\u2019ve heard tell that Fortune, as they call her, is a drunken and capricious woman and, worse still, blind; and so she doesn\u2019t see what she\u2019s doing, and doesn\u2019t know whom she is casting down or raising up.\u201d "

        "content": "One of Turkey\u2019s biggest clubs will not play European football next season after being found guilty of breaching UEFA\u2019s financial fair play rules. Besiktas, 13-time national champions, will miss out on continental competition for two of the next five seasons \u2013 though the second qualification ban is suspended for a probationary period. UEFA said Bursaspor, another former Turkish titleholder, had also been barred from Europe next season while Turkish reports said Gaziantepspor will miss out the next time it qualifies due to a similar rules breach. Istanbul-based Besiktas had qualified for the second-tier Europa League after finishing fourth in the domestic table, but its place has now been provisionally given to Eskisehirspor. Eskisehirspor failed to earn a European place in the end of season playoffs, finishing behind Bursaspor \u2013 whose Europa League place may now instead go to Istanbul B.B. The Turkish Federation had to submit its candidates for European competition on Thursday, but UEFA does not have to accept them. Bursaspor, which won the Turkish title for the first time in 2010 and competed in the European Champions League the following season, said it will appeal UEFA\u2019s ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Its initial fine of \u20ac200,000 ($247,000) was cut to \u20ac50,000 ($61,000) by UEFA\u2019s appeals body, and suspended for a period of four years. \u201cWe were not supposed to face a ban. This is a murder of law,\u201d Bursaspor chairman Ibrahim Yaz\u0131ic told the Anatolia news agency. \u201cI cannot understand how a club without debt like Bursaspor can be hit with a ban. We believe that UEFA will return from its mistake.\u201d Besiktas had been fined \u20ac500,000 ($618,000) but this was reduced to \u20ac200,000 \u2013 with half of that on probation for five years. It will also appeal. \u201cThe biggest reason for the ban was stated as the delays in payments to players,\u201d lawyer Emin Ozkurt told CNN Turk. The Hurriyet Daily News said UEFA had earlier warned Besiktas about its levels of debt after looking at the club\u2019s accounts for the second and third quarters of 2011. Besiktas reached the last 16 of the 2011-12 Europa League, losing to eventual champion Atletico Madrid. The financial fair play rules have been introduced in order to stop clubs spending more than they earn and getting into difficulties. The regulations also seek to counter scenarios where wealthy benefactors bankroll excessive spending to the disadvantage of smaller rival clubs, and distort transfer market values.  "

        "content": "UK Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt defended his conduct in the case of a bid by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp. to take over British satellite broadcaster BSkyB at a hearing Thursday. Hunt, the Cabinet minister who oversees British broadcasting, has been under pressure over his contacts with News Corp. since apparent back channel communications were revealed between a senior aide and the company last month. Prime Minister David Cameron, who appointed Hunt to adjudicate the bid, has also faced questions over his relations with News Corp. and the Murdoch family. But Downing Street said Thursday Hunt had \u201cacted properly\u201d and had not breached the rules governing the way ministers are required to behave. Hunt\u2019s special adviser, Adam Smith, resigned in April after the extent of his contacts with Murdoch representatives over the multi-billion dollar BSkyB bid were revealed, saying they went beyond what the minister had authorized. News Corp., which owns 39% of BSkyB, eventually pulled out of the takeover attempt last summer amid a furor over allegations of phone hacking by the News of the World newspaper, owned by News Corp.\u2019s British publishing arm, News International. The paper was closed down. Hunt at times looked uncomfortable as he was grilled at the Leveson Inquiry in London over texts and e-mails dealing with the BSkyB takeover. Among them were text messages from James Murdoch, son of Rupert Murdoch and a senior News Corp. executive, and the firm\u2019s chief lobbyist, Fred Michel, to Hunt and in particular to his adviser, Smith. Some of the texts between Hunt and James Murdoch, presented as evidence to the independent judge-led inquiry, appeared to show a close relationship between the two. Among them was a congratulatory message Hunt sent to Murdoch after it was announced that the European Commission would not intervene over the takeover bid. \u201cGreat and congrats on Brussels, just Ofcom to go,\u201d he wrote. Hours later, Hunt, who heads the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, was asked to oversee the bid process. Meanwhile, Michel \u2013 who Hunt described as \u201cpushy\u201d \u2013 sent 542 text messages to Smith, the inquiry heard. Of those, 35 were sent in two days at one important stage in the process. Michel also made about 140 phone calls to Smith.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t predict this barrage of contact from Mr. Michel,\u201d Hunt said.  Hunt said Michel\u2019s text message contact with him never led to any substantive discussions about the bid. Hunt stressed that he was getting independent advice from Ofcom, the independent UK media regulator, and the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) in order to ensure due process was followed and persuade the public that it was fair. He characterized his view on the bid before he was asked to oversee the process in December 2010 as \u201csympathetic,\u201d rather than \u201csupportive,\u201d saying he did not act to advance it. Once he was put in charge of the process, he was careful to take the required impartial approach and acted with \u201cscrupulous fairness,\u201d Hunt insisted. He was not a \u201ccheerleader\u201d for News Corp., Hunt said, arguing that he repeatedly angered James Murdoch by requiring more scrutiny of the bid by independent bodies. After the phone hacking scandal broke, he asked Ofcom and the OFT to look again at whether News Corp. could be trusted to live up to its undertakings with regard to BSkyB, he said, because he was concerned there might be a broader problem of corporate governance. Questioned over his judgment in responding to Michel\u2019s text messages, the minister said his interpretation was that in his quasi-judicial role a \u201ccourteous reply to a text message was fine.\u201d He added, \u201cBut I think now I would probably not take the same view and would avoid text messages. But it was my assessment that it had no impact on process, the decisions I took. It was just me being courteous.\u201d Hunt acknowledged that Michel deployed flattery \u201cpersistently and frequently,\u201d and said he was shocked when he discovered the level of contact between Michel and Smith. It appeared to have led to the use of \u201coccasionally inappropriate\u201d language on the part of his aide, he said. He also defended the integrity of Smith, saying he was \u201cvery capable and decent,\u201d and added that he wished his aide had alerted his colleagues to the pressure he was under from News Corp.\u2019s lobbyist. But in the end, he had no choice but reluctantly to accept Smith\u2019s resignation, Hunt said. Alan Rusbridger, editor of the Guardian newspaper, highlighted the different treatment by Hunt\u2019s department of News Corp. and those who opposed the takeover, in comments posted on Twitter Thursday. \u201cNo chummy texts or spad (special adviser) for opponents of Sky. Were told to address all concerns to Treasury Solicitor,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThousands of texts, e-mails and phone calls\u201d were exchanged between News Corp. and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, Rusbridger said, while the newspaper got just one meeting with Hunt. Questioned before the inquiry, Hunt said he was \u201ca very passionate supporter of having a free and vibrant press,\u201d and that he felt the BSkyB bid would help modernize the UK media industry. Hunt last month faced calls from opposition lawmakers to resign over his handling of the BSkyB bid, saying he had colluded with News Corp. and breached the ministerial code of conduct, which governs how ministers behave in office. But Cameron said Hunt had his support and urged lawmakers to await the conclusion of the Leveson Inquiry before passing judgment. Downing Street said in a statement Thursday: \u201cJeremy Hunt\u2019s evidence has shown that he acted properly while he was responsible for the BSkyB bid. He took independent advice at every turn, as well as a number of decisions which were against News Corporation\u2019s wishes.\u201d However, there are \u201clessons to be learned\u201d from the process, the statement added, and ministers have been sent guidance on how quasi-judicial decisions are taken. The current phase of the Leveson Inquiry \u2013 which was set up by the coalition government in response to the phone hacking scandal \u2013 is examining the relationship between the press and politicians."

        "content": "Six-time champion Rafael Nadal cruised into the third round of the French Open on Thursday, recording a crushing 6-2 6-2 6-0 win over Uzbekistan\u2019s Denis Istomin. The second seed, chasing a record seventh Roland Garros title, hit 25 winners on his way to a 47th win at the clay-court grand slam. The world No. 2 has lost just once in 48 matches at the Paris event, to Robin Soderling in the fourth round of the 2009 tournament, and he will look to continue his impressive run against  Argentina\u2019s Eduardo Schwank. Nadal was satisfied with his performance, but insisted there were areas of his game where he could still improve. \u201cI can improve things,\u201d the 25-year-old told the ATP Tour\u2019s official website. \u201cThe serve is the first one.   \u201cI think I improved the level of my serve during the match, but I started the match serving badly. For the rest, more or less, I have to be happy.\u201d While Nadal strolled, fourth seed Andy Murray toiled. The Briton overcame injury and a one-set deficit to eventually defeat Finland\u2019s Jarkko Nieminen. Murray, still searching for a first grand slam title, had to summon his trainer in the first set as he struggled with a back injury. World No. 48 Nieminen capitalized as he took the opener 6-1, but Murray fought back to clinch a 1-6 6-4 6-1 6-2 win in two hours and 17 minutes. \u201cI should have taken a double break in the second set to have taken the set,\u201d said a disappointed Nieminen.  \u201cI couldn\u2019t take that, and then I played one very poor changeover, two bad games, and then he started to play better. I really never got the momentum back.\u201d Murray will play Santiago Giraldo in the third round after the Colombian beat Australia\u2019s 25th seed Bernard Tomic 6-4 6-1 6-3. Two years after winning the longest match in grand slam history, No.10 John Isner was at it again as he faced France\u2019s Paul Henri-Mathieu in a marathon encounter. But unlike his clash with Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon 2010, Isner was beaten 6-7 (7-2) 6-4 6-4 3-6 18-16 in a grueling contest which lasted five hours and 41 minutes.  Mathieu\u2019s compatriot Jo-Wilfried Tsonga delighted the home crowd with a 6-2 4-6 6-2 6-1 victory over Germany\u2019s Cedric-Marcel Stebe in a match which had began on Wednesday. \u201cYesterday, the conditions were not the ones I like very much,\u201d the No. 5 said after setting up a clash with Italian Fabio Fognini. \u201cWhen the weather is heavy, I find it difficult to play. I can\u2019t volley well. \u201cSo I think it was a good idea the match was stopped yesterday and I could start again in far better conditions for me.\u201d Spanish No.6 David Ferrer looked comfortable as he beat France\u2019s Benoit Paire 6-3 6-3 6-2. The two-time quarterfinalist will face Russian 27th seed Mikhail Youzhny in round three. Canadian rising star and 2011 Rookie of the Year Milos Raonic set up a match with 13th seed Juan Monaco by beating American Jesse Levine 6-4 7-5 6-2. Argentina\u2019s Monaco registered a straight-sets win over Lukas Rosol of the Czech Republic.  "

It\u2019s good for the audience, it\u2019s good for the sport to bring attention to the races,\u201d said the Spaniard, who leads the world championship by three points, with 14 rounds remaining.   \u201cOn the other hand we can lose credibility. We cannot lose that the best teams, the best drivers, the best strategies win the races, because at the moment from the outside it seems that in every race anyone can win.   \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter the talent, it doesn\u2019t matter the team, the performance \u2013 it\u2019s like a lottery.  What you achieve in Formula One is not by chance.  We need to make clear that if you win a race, it\u2019s because you did something better. And I don\u2019t think at the moment that this is clear for everybody.\u201d Alonso\u2019s position at the head of the standings could not have been predicted at the start of this season, when he and his Italian team publicly doubted the race pace of the two Ferraris. \u201cWe were not happy with the car at the beginning of the season.  We were not rich with the expectations and the team tried to understand the problems as soon as possible and tried to make the changes,\u201d the 30-year-old said.   \u201cThey seemed to work but even if we are happy now with the position and with the points we achieved, we still know and are honest with ourselves knowing that we are not quick enough at the moment still.  There is still plenty of work to do but we think a strong reaction is still to come from Ferrari.\u201d F1 teams battle from race to race to make minor adjustments which often have a big impact on performance, and Alonso gave credit to Ferrari\u2019s technicians for improving the cars. \u201cWe changed mainly aerodynamics.  Formula One is dominated by aerodynamics and we had some areas of the car that were not working exactly as they were designed, so we did some tweaks there,\u201d he said.   \u201cWe changed some philosophies of working in the car and it started to work. But as I said it\u2019s not enough, we know that and we will keep doing upgrades to the car.\u201d While Alonso has shown his ability in an underperforming car, teammate Felipe Massa is under increasing pressure to retain his place. The Brazilian, a world championship runner-up in 2008, has recovered from serious head injuries suffered the following year but has very much been the number two driver since Alonso arrived from Renault in 2010.  \u201cWe know that there has been some coincidences and some bad luck and moments in particular races that he didn\u2019t score points he deserved,\u201d Alonso said.   \u201cWe know that in practice and in qualifying we are much closer, we are fighting, we are together in some of the first corners, but then some factors make him always in some troubles, some incidents, and he lost points. \u201cBut he has the talent, he has full support from our bosses, from me, from everybody in the team and we know the talent from Felipe.  We know that before later he will shine.\u201d Alonso became F1\u2019s youngest double world champion when he won back-to-back titles with Renault in 2005-06, but he was usurped by Red Bull\u2019s Sebastian Vettel last year. Now the German driver has been tipped to follow Alonso\u2019s footsteps and join the most successful team in the sport\u2019s history, reportedly in 2014. \u201c(It\u2019s) only speculation.  Every year in Ferrari it is like this,\u201d Alonso said.   \u201cI had this when I was with Renault in the past.  Every year around summer always the speculations: \u2018Alonso will go to Ferrari.\u2019  I answered many questions over the years and now when I joined Ferrari it is the opposite.   \u201cEvery year someone is coming to Ferrari, it has been like this.  I think it is something you have to deal also when you are in Ferrari.\u201d Alonso is hoping, despite his car\u2019s weaknesses, that he can deliver Ferrari\u2019s first drivers\u2019 title since Kimi Raikkonen in 2007. \u201cThings are complex and not straightforward and I think it will be quite tight for the championship,\u201d said Alonso, who is 25 points ahead of Raikkonen, back on the grid this year with Lotus after a two-year absence.   \u201cThere is not one car dominating the season as we saw in the last couple of years.  I think we will be there.  I don\u2019t know if we will be champions but we will fight until the last race, I am sure.\u201d "

        "content": "Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s spokesman has denied the pontiff will resign over the arrest of his butler on suspicion of leaking confidential documents, the Vatican press office said Thursday. During a Wednesday meeting with journalists to answer questions about the situation, the Rev. Frederico Lombardi said the \u201chypothesis\u201d advanced by some media outlets that the pope would resign are \u201cbaseless creations of some journalists, which have no foundation in reality.\u201d Butler Paolo Gabriele, 46, was arrested last week and accused of illegal possession of confidential documents. Lombardi said Wednesday that Gabriele has met with his attorneys, \u201cwho will probably request monitored surveillance or house arrest for their client.\u201d Gabriele, one of only a handful of people with access to the pontiff\u2019s private desk, has been charged with aggravated theft for allegedly stealing private documents, Lombardi said earlier. He is suspected of leaking the papers to an Italian journalist. The Vatican has said confidential documents were found in Gabriele\u2019s apartment in Vatican territory. But Lombardi said Wednesday that media reports that said packets of documents, prepared for sending to specific people, were found in Gabriele\u2019s home were unfounded. Material found in Gabriele\u2019s possession is being studied and catalogued, he said. \u201cIt seems to me,\u201d Lombardi said, \u201cthat there is a line of desire for truth and clarity, a desire for transparency that, although it will take time, continues forward. I thus honestly believe that we are trying to handle this new situation: We are seeking the truth and trying to objectively understand what may have happened.\u201d The investigation, he said, is still in its preliminary stages. Last month, the Vatican gave Cardinal Julian Herranz a \u201cpontifical mandate\u201d to uncover the source of hundreds of personal letters and confidential documents given to Gianluigi Nuzzi, an Italian journalist and author of \u201cSua Santita,\u201d a book that translates to \u201cHis Holiness\u201d and includes the documents. Nuzzi would not divulge his sources but previously told CNN that his primary source \u2013 whom he referred to as \u201cMaria\u201d in his book \u2013 \u201crisked life and limb\u201d if ever discovered. He said the source worked inside the Vatican but would not reveal details, including the source\u2019s gender, age and whether or not they were clergy. He said this week that he had not been questioned in connection with Gabriele\u2019s arrest.  The Vatican called publication of Nuzzi\u2019s book \u201ccriminal\u201d when it was released in Italian this month. A top Roman Catholic Church official, Archbishop Angelo Becciu, told the Vatican\u2019s official newspaper Wednesday the theft of the documents was \u201can immoral act of unprecedented gravity\u201d and a \u201cdespicable abuse of the relationship of trust that exists between Benedict XVI and those who turn to him.\u201d With the leaks, he said, the pope\u2019s very ministry \u201chas come under attack.\u201d But observers say the scandal lifts the lid on a secret power struggle going on behind the closed doors of the Catholic Church. The alleged documents leak, along with the firing of the head of the Vatican Bank, are aimed at weakening the authority of the pope\u2019s second-in-command, they say.  Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican\u2019s secretary of state, is involved in a power struggle with his predecessor, the observers said. \u201cThe reason for this fight is that the secretary of state will have a strong influence over the next conclave which will choose the next pope,\u201d said Giacomo Galeazzi, a journalist at the Italian daily La Stampa.  Cardinal Angelo Sodano, secretary of state to the late John Paul II, is trying to sideline Bertone and put one of his own proteges in place before Benedict dies, he said. \u201cThe leaks will end when Bertone is out as secretary of state,\u201d Galeazzi said. When he became Vatican secretary of state, Bertone \u201cdid what normally happens,\u201d said the Rev. Thomas Reese, author of \u201cInside the Vatican.\u201d \u201cHe brought in his team, the people he likes, the people he trusts, and put them in key positions in the Vatican.\u201d \u201cThere are people who had hitched their star to the previous secretary of state, who thought by now they would become an archbishop or a cardinal, and they didn\u2019t,\u201d Reese said. \u201cThese people are unhappy and don\u2019t like Bertone.\u201d"

        "content": "The English Premier League has retained its place as European football\u2019s most lucrative competition after revenues for the 2010/11 season increased by 12% to top \u00a32.27 billion ($3.5 bn), according to a new report. But more than 80% of that increase was swallowed up by wages, which rose to \u00a31.6 billion ($2.47 bn) and now make up 70% of the overall revenue, accountancy firm Deloitte said. The German Bundesliga remained the continent\u2019s most profitable league as operating profits rose to \u00a3154m ($238m), an increase of nearly a quarter on the previous year. In comparison, the Premier League\u2019s operating profits dropped by \u00a316m ($24.8m) to \u00a368m ($105m). Big-spending Man City top Premier League value table Dan Jones, from the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said: \u201cTop clubs in English football have continued to show impressive revenue growth despite a difficult economic climate.  \u201cPremier League clubs\u2019 revenues increased by 12% in 2010/11, driven by broadcast revenue increasing by 13% to \u00a31,17 bn ($1.8 bn) in the first year of a new three year broadcast cycle.  \u201cThis uplift was primarily due to an increase in overseas broadcast deal values, demonstrating once again the Premier League\u2019s unrivaled global popularity. \u201c Hugely popular it may be but with the Premier League again breaking a new record for spending on transfer fees, it will soon have to confront UEFA\u2019s Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations. Soccer\u2019s European governing body introduced FFP, which began its monitoring phase last season, to break the cycle of huge debts and force clubs to spend no more than they earn. The rules are also designed to prevent wealthy owners writing off big debts through their personal fortunes, like at Chelsea, where Russian owner Roman Abramovich has pumped in \u00a3819m ($1.2 bn), according to Deloitte. Adam Bull from Deloitte, said: \u201cDespite the increase in revenue generated by Premier League clubs, operating profits reduced by \u00a316m ($24.8m) to \u00a368m ($105m) in 2010/11 and combined pre-tax losses were \u00a3380m ($588m).  \u201cGross transfer spending by Premier League clubs increased by 38%, from \u00a3210m ($325m) to a record level of \u00a3769m ($1.1 bn). The challenge for clubs remains converting impressive revenue growth into sustainable profits.  \u201cThis will become even more important for a number of clubs as the financial results for 2011/12 will, for the first time, count towards their UEFA Financial Fair Play break-even calculation.\u201d Although the net debt of Premier League clubs did fall to its lowest level since 2006, half of the 20 teams reported an increase in losses. Brand power: Football\u2019s most valuable clubs unveiled But thanks to a large upgrade in facilities over the past decade the Premier League\u2019s clubs recorded an increase in their fixed assets to almost \u00a31.9 billion ($2.9 bn). Paul Rawnsley, director in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said many Premier League clubs would have to make significant adjustments to meet FFP.  \u201cThis is the cornerstone of UEFA\u2019s financial fair play regulations which aim to help clubs across Europe achieve a more sustainable balance between their costs and revenues and encourages investment for the longer term benefit of football.   \u201cA significant number of clubs around Europe have some distance to travel on the road towards compliance.  \u201cFor many clubs there is a renewed focus on increasing revenues and the cost-side of the business model of some clubs also needs adapting. \u201cOverall, we expect the effective implementation of these measures, at both domestic and international levels, will help deliver a better balance between clubs\u2019 costs and revenues.\u201d"

        "content": "English Premier League club Liverpool have appointed Brendan Rodgers as their new manager. After being introduced by Liverpool chairman Tom Werner, the 39-year-old Rodgers, who moves to Anfield from Swansea City, revealed that he had insisted that he would not work under a director of football. \u201cThat was something I made clear I couldn\u2019t work with,\u201d said the Northern Irishman. \u201cWhat you need is an outstanding team. We will form a technical board that will have four or five people that will decide the way forward.\u201d  Rodgers succeeds club legend Kenny Dalglish, who was sacked earlier this month. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll fight for my life and for the people in this city,\u201d said Rodgers. \u201cWe might not be ready for the title now but the process begins today.,\u201d he added, a reference to the fact that Liverpool last won the title in 1990. Liverpool have reached an agreement with Swawsea for three members of Rodgers\u2019 backroom staff to follow him to Anfield. The Northern Irish coach led Welsh team Swansea into the Premier League in 2011 and impressed pundits with their fluent passing style as they finished 11th in their first season. Liverpool have been on the hunt for a new manager after sacking Dalglish following a disappointing season, in which they achieved their lowest ever Premier League finish. The club did win the League Cup but were beaten in the FA Cup final by Chelsea, prompting American owners Fenway Sports Group, who also own baseball\u2019s Boston Red Sox, to act. The Merseyside outfit had also spoken to Wigan manager Roberto Martinez about the managerial vacancy before settling on Rodgers. The 39-year-old began his coaching career at Chelsea, under the stewardship of Jose Mourinho, who led the club to successive Premier League titles in 2005 and 2006 and now coaches Spanish giants Real Madrid. Rodgers spent a season in charge at Watford, in the second tier of English football, before moving to Reading in 2009, but he only lasted six months before he was sacked. He took over at Swansea in 2010 and led the club into the Premier League at the first time of asking after a win in the playoff final against former club Reading. Swansea quickly grew into life in the top flight and gained a clutch of notable scalps. They beat Premier League champions Manchester City, Arsenal and, ironically, Liverpool on the final day of the season. Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins said: \u201cAlthough we are very disappointed to lose such a talented, young British manager, we didn\u2019t wish to stand in his way. As always at Swansea City, we want people working here who are fully committed to the task ahead. \u201cWe wish Brendan every success in the future. We will always remain good friends and we thank him for all his hard work and passion at this football club over the past two years. \u201cWe shall now refocus and quickly start the process of finding his replacement to continue the great work Brendan has carried out at this football club.\u201d Meanwhile, Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson has been drafted into England\u2019s Euro 2012 squad after Frank Lampard was forced to withdraw with a thigh injury. The 21-year-old made 37 Premier League appearances for Liverpool last season, after joining the club from Sunderland in June 2011. Henderson will be hoping to add to the two international caps he has gained so far in his career."

        "content": "With all the fuss in the media at the moment about Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s Diamond Jubilee anyone could be forgiven for thinking that the British are united in their adoration of their monarch. The reality is that while a large swathe of public opinion is largely indifferent to the royals \u2013 but happy to have an extra public holiday to mark the jubilee \u2013 many millions want the whole institution of monarchy consigned to the history books.   The British republican movement has been growing rapidly over the past 18 months \u2013 thanks in large part to the heightened royal coverage prompted by last year\u2019s wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton and this year\u2019s jubilee. Our cause is simple: it\u2019s about democratic reform and a rejection of inherited power and privilege. The case for Britain becoming a republic is threefold: the monarchy is wrong in principle, in practice and it is wrong politically. We\u2019re supposed to be a democratic society, which means we should cherish and value democratic values, such as equality of citizenship, freedom to participate in government, accountability and transparency.  In a democratic society there is no room for a head of state who is put there for life and by birth.  A hereditary monarch has no place in a society that believes \u201cwe the people\u201d should be in charge. The principled objection is unanswerable. In practice the monarchy is an institution that is not fit for purpose. It is secretive, having recently lobbied successfully to have itself removed entirely from the reaches of our Freedom of Information laws; it lobbies government ministers for improvements to its financial benefits and for its own private agenda; it is hugely costly \u2013 an estimated \u00a3202 million a year, enough to pay for thousands of teachers, nurses or police officers at a time of sweeping public spending cuts.   The queen and Prince Charles must be asked for consent before our elected parliament is able to debate any legislation that affects their private interests \u2013 that consent is sought in secret and we have no idea whether, how or how many times it has been used. Politically the monarchy is wrong because \u2013 contrary to what is believed by many here and abroad \u2013 it is a central feature of our unwritten constitution. The \u201cCrown\u201d is the supreme authority in this country \u2013 not the people. The Crown has vast powers that cannot be challenged in a court of law and those powers are exercised by the queen on the instruction of our prime minister.   Those powers include considerable patronage \u2013 the ability to appoint bishops, government ministers, heads of public bodies and so on \u2013 as well as the power to go to war, sign treaties and change the law through the little-understood Privy Council. Thanks to the Crown there is almost no limit to the power of our politicians other than those limits they place upon themselves (such as our Human Rights Act, which they have the power to repeal). The pomp of the monarchy is a neat way of distracting from this highly questionable constitutional arrangement. It is the power of the Crown and the authority it gives our politicians that most likely explains the hostility every government has shown the republican movement. But rather than engage with the issue on these serious matters most monarchists instead implore us to believe in fantasy and make-believe. \u201cThe queen has never put a foot wrong\u201d is the time-honored clich\u00e9, along with \u201cbut what about all the tourism the monarchy generates?\u201d The tourism argument goes that as Britain has a monarchy and also attracts a lot of tourists, the monarchy obviously acts as a great tourism magnet and therefore generates millions of pounds of revenue and economic activity. The problem is that there are no facts to back this up.  Does the monarchy pay its way? There is no reason to believe that if Britain abandoned the monarchy tourism would suffer \u2013 that\u2019s something even the head of official tourism agency VisitBritain has acknowledged. Our history is certainly an attraction \u2013 and the great thing about our history is that it will always be there regardless of what we do in the future. Selling hotel rooms and \u201cI Love London\u201d T-shirts is, anyway, no reason to abandon a proud ambition for democratic reform.  As for the queen, well we really have no idea how she has done her job given that most of it is done behind closed doors. There has never been any real scrutiny of her role and she has never had to compete in open and free competition for the job. If keeping quiet and cutting ribbons is all we can expect of our head of state then perhaps we can agree she\u2019s done well \u2013 but surely we can expect more.  As a national figurehead and leading public figure the queen has utterly failed to do anything of note or worth. After 60 years who can quote a famous speech or point to a moment of crisis or celebration when the queen offered leadership and inspiration? For all the failures of the monarchy \u2013 in principle, practice and in political terms \u2013 the queen and the institution offer little in return but an empty chair where an inspiring national figure could have stood. These are the reasons why come the jubilee, republicans will be rejecting the celebrations and demanding real democratic change."

        "content": "The Vatican expressed rare public anger Wednesday in blasting the leaking of private papers from the pope\u2019s apartment, a scandal that observers say lifts the lid on a secret power struggle going on behind the closed doors of the Catholic Church. A top Roman Catholic Church official called the theft of the documents \u201can immoral act of unprecedented gravity\u201d and \u201cdespicable abuse of the relationship of trust that exists between Benedict XVI and those who turn to him.\u201d  Archbishop Angelo Becciu made the remarks to the Vatican\u2019s official newspaper six days after the pope\u2019s butler was arrested for leaking the papers. Paolo Gabriele, 46, was arrested Wednesday on accusations of illegal possession of confidential documents, the Vatican said in a statement issued three days after the arrest. With the leaks, the pope\u2019s very ministry \u201chas come under attack,\u201d Becciu said. The pope himself referred briefly to the scandal at the end of his regular Wednesday audience, his first public remarks on the matter. He criticized reports about the affair as \u201centirely gratuitous\u201d and presenting \u201ca completely unrealistic image of the Holy See.\u201d But experts say that exactly the opposite may be the truth, and that the arrest, alongside the firing of the head of the Vatican Bank a day later, may reveal the battle going on behind the scenes at the Vatican. The two events are bad PR for the top hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church, but they may be more than that, experts say. They could affect who becomes the next pope. The effect of each one is the same: to weaken the authority of  Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s second in command. Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican secretary of state, is involved in a power struggle with his predecessor, experts say.  \u201cThe reason for this fight is that the secretary of state will have a strong influence over the next conclave which will choose the next pope,\u201d said Giacomo Galeazzi, a journalist at the Italian daily La Stampa. The late John Paul II\u2019s secretary of state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, is trying to sideline Bertone and put one of his own proeteges in place before Benedict dies, Galeazzi said. \u201cThe leaks will end when Bertone is out as secretary of state,\u201d he predicted. He said he expects that Bertone, who will be 78 in December, would be replaced at the end of the year, but not by the cardinal Sodano wants. Sodano, who is now the dean of the College of Cardinals, isn\u2019t the only one who doesn\u2019t like Bertone, said the Rev. Thomas Reese, author of \u201cInside the Vatican.\u201d When he became Vatican Secretary of State, Bertone \u201cdid what normally happens. He brought in his team, the people he likes, the people he trusts, and he put them in key positions in the Vatican,\u201d Reese said. \u201cThere are people who had hitched their star to the previous secretary of state who thought by now they would become an archbishop or a cardinal, and they didn\u2019t,\u201d Reese said. \u201cThese people are unhappy and don\u2019t like Bertone.\u201d Part of the reason for the butler and bank scandals is that the Vatican hasn\u2019t been run well in decades, Reese said. \u201cClerics don\u2019t go to Harvard Business School. Bertone is a theologian. He doesn\u2019t have an MBA,\u201d he said. And Benedict is no better, he said. \u201cHe is a German professor. He\u2019s a person who is into ideas, not a manager, and yet he is running a 1.2-billion member organization,\u201d Reese said. There\u2019s a faction within the Vatican that wants the next pope to be \u201ca better manger who can get the shop in order,\u201d Reese said.  \u201cA lot of people think that would be an Italian, of course,\u201d after two popes from outside of Italy, John Paul II from Poland and Benedict from Germany, he said. But the undermining of Bertone may work against that faction, he said. \u201cBertone is from the Vatican and is Italian,\u201d Reese pointed out. \u201cPeople may say we need somebody from outside who can come in and knock heads together and make it work.\u201d Reese isn\u2019t taking a position on where the next pope should be from, but he has strong views on what Benedict\u2019s successor should do: \u201cThe place really needs to be restructured and reorganized. It still operates in many ways like a 19th century European court.\u201d"

        "content": "When Queen Elizabeth II stayed away from a grief-stricken London after the 1997 death of Princess Diana, she was criticized for being aloof and failing to respond to public anger and loss.  But, according to a new account offered by one of the monarch\u2019s closest friends, the truth behind the queen\u2019s decision to temporarily abandon her people was her overwhelming concern for the welfare of Diana\u2019s sons, Princes William and Harry. Margaret Rhodes, the queen\u2019s first cousin and one of her oldest companions, revealed in an interview with CNN that the queen chose to remain at her Scottish residence, Balmoral, because she put her duties as a grandmother over those as a monarch. \u201cShe was castigated\u2026 for staying up at Balmoral with the two little boys,\u201d Rhodes said, speaking ahead of celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of the queen\u2019s succession. \u201cShe was being a proper granny. What was the point of bringing the boys down to sit in London with nothing to do but sit there feeling sad about mum. Personally I think I would have behaved in exactly the same way.\u201d Interactive: Who\u2019s who in the House of Windsor The days after Diana\u2019s death were among the darkest of the 86-year-old queen\u2019s reign. Her failure to appear even as tributes left by thousands of mourners transformed the streets near Buckingham Palace into a sea of flowers, was at the time blamed on an antipathy towards Diana that clashed with public affection for the \u201cpeople\u2019s princess.\u201d It was only when Tony Blair, then the prime minister, intervened that she returned to London and acknowledged the outpouring of grief \u2013 a gesture that helped win back waning affections for the royal family.   \u201cIt was very sensible, maybe not as queen,\u201d said Rhodes. \u201cBut she made it all right in the end by coming down and looking at all the flowers.\u201d Born just a few months after the queen, Rhodes has known the monarch her whole life and is widely seen as one of the greatest sources of insight on life within the royal family. After working as a secretary for British the intelligence agency MI6 during World War II, she served as a lady-in-waiting to the queen\u2019s mother and was one of the queen\u2019s bridesmaids. The two have remained steadfast friends throughout their lives. Rhodes lives in a house close to the royal residence at Windsor Castle, west of London, where she regularly serves the queen a morning tipple of her favorite \u201cbooze.\u201d Read: Young queen who grew into modern monarch \u201cI do see the queen most Sundays,\u201d Rhodes told CNN. \u201cWe go to the same little church in the park here on Sunday and, unless she\u2019s very busy, she comes in and has a drink after church so it keeps up the relationship. Gin and Dubonnet is her booze in the morning.\u201d Rhodes also offered insight on the queen\u2019s relationship with Prince Philip, claiming it was love at first sight when the future monarch, barely into her teens, first encountered the dashing young naval officer, then aged 17. \u201cI think she fell in love when she was 13,\u201d she said. \u201cGod he was good looking. You know he was a Viking god. She has never looked at anybody else ever and I think he really truly has been a rock.\u201d Both as a young girl and in later years, Rhodes paints a picture of her friend as an ordinary woman who is capable of throwing off the airs of royalty. She tells of the time, after victory was declared in Europe at the end of World War II, that Rhodes accompanied the queen and her sister as they celebrated incognito among the crowds outside Buckingham Palace. \u201cWe all surged up to Trafalgar Square. Everybody was kissing everybody and putting on policemens helmets on their heads, you know that sort of thing. It went on for four nights running.  Interactive: A year in the life of the queen \u201cWe came back to Buckingham Palace and started yelling for the king, the king and queen to come out on the balcony. Their two daughters were yelling, which was also the first time they had seen the balcony from down below, so it was a magical moment.  \u201cWe did it for several more nights. There certainly was one occasion when we were doing the conga. We went in one door of the Ritz and congaed our way through and came out the other door. It was all part of the jollifications.\u201d Speaking about the marital troubles that have blighted three of the queen\u2019s four children \u2013 Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Prince Andrew \u2013 she described the situation as \u201cterribly sad.\u201d However, she added, the queen has a sense of humor and an ordinary side to her personality that, had she not taken the throne, would have allowed her to enjoy life outside of royalty. \u201cIf you are the queen you have to be queenly. On her own she\u2019s rather like one of us, she laughs at the same jokes.  \u201cI mean if she didn\u2019t happen to be born as queen she would be the owner of, hopefully, a rather nice country estate where she would have lots and lots of dogs and horses and she\u2019d be happy.\u201d"

        "content": "Roger Federer recorded the 234th grand slam win of his career Wednesday to break Jimmy Connors\u2019 record for most victories in major championships. But the 16-time grand slam winner was made to work hard in his eventual 6-3 6-2 6-7 6-3 defeat of Romania\u2019s Adrian Ungur, as he inched closer to a final four showdown with world No. 1 Novak Djokovic. The Swiss is playing in his 50th grand slam tournament and despite a wobble during a third set tiebreak, he did enough to set up a third round clash with either Slovakia\u2019s Martin  Klizan or Nicolas Mahut of France. \u201cI reached the tie-breaker and instead of being aggressive, I let him show me what he could do,\u201d Federer told the ATP Tour\u2019s official website. \u201cHe played two beautiful shots, and then I started not playing very well. The life of Brian: Baker\u2019s French Open fairytale \u201cEven though I won the first set 6-3 with a solid break, I knew that if he was to get in the match, it would be more difficult, and he had many opportunities during the second set.  \u201cIn the third set I made wrong decisions. He got in the match, and he played a very good third set. Then he relaxed a bit at the beginning of the fourth set, which was quite crucial.\u201d Federer took his all-time record in major championships to 234 wins and 35 defeats and the 30-year-old says he is enjoying the confidence his experience brings. He added: \u201cI expect myself to win and I usually manage to do it. It\u2019s not like that at the start of your career when you think you are good enough but you are not  that good yet.\u201d Federer is on course for a semifinal clash with the world\u2019s top ranked player after Djokovic eased into round three with a 6-0 6-4 6-4 win over Blaz Kavcic of Slovenia. It was Djokovic\u2019s 23rd consecutive victory at major championships as he strives to complete a career slam.  Should the 25-year-old win at Roland Garros he will become the first man in 43 years to hold all four major titles at the same time. \u201cHe was defending really well in the second and third sets, especially in the second,\u201d Djokovic told the ATP Tour website.  \u201cI gave him the opportunity to come back to the match after a perfect first set, first seven games. Of course I didn\u2019t underestimate my opponent today.  \u201cI expected him to fight. I expected him to come back. He didn\u2019t have anything to lose, and he showed his quality and it was a really, really great second and third set. \u201cI\u2019m happy with the game overall. I think everything was working really well. I\u2019m feeling better and better every match.\u201d Elsewhere, Tomas Berdych, the No. 7 seed looked in good touch as he dispatched France\u2019s Michael Llodra 6-2 6-3 6-3. The No. 9 seed Juan Martin del Potro booked a place in round three with a 6-7 7-6 6-4, 6-4 win over France\u2019s Edouard Roger-Vasselin. The 2009 U.S. Open champion, from Argentina, will now face Croatian Marin Cilic after the No. 21 seed defeated Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain 7-6 6-2 6-3."

        "content": "A former editor of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s disgraced News of the World tabloid was arrested and charged with perjury over court testimony about phone hacking, according to the United Kingdom\u2019s Press Association. Andy Coulson, 44, was held in connection with a Scottish police investigation into phone hacking and perjury at the trial of a politician, Tommy Sheridan, who had sued the News of the World. The case is potentially deeply embarrassing for British Prime Minister David Cameron, who hired Coulson to run his communications team after Coulson resigned from the News of the World. Coulson no longer works for Cameron. Earlier Wednesday, Scotland\u2019s Glasgow-based Strathclyde Police announced that they had detained a 44-year-old man in London on suspicion of perjury. They did not name him.  At the high court in Glasgow in December 2010, Coulson denied under oath that he had ever met or spoken to a private detective employed by News of the World to hack phones, according to British press reports at the time. Coulson quit when a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, and the paper\u2019s royal correspondent, Clive Goodman, were sent to prison in 2007 for hacking phones.  Coulson has always denied knowing about illegal activity at the paper he ran. He said he quit because he was responsible as editor for what his staff did. He was snapped up by Cameron shortly after he left the Murdoch paper. Coulson was arrested separately by London police last year on suspicion of conspiracy to hack phones and to bribe officials. He is free on bail. Phone hacking at News of the World has sparked three investigations by police in London, two parliamentary investigations and a judge-led independent inquiry. The newspaper was closed in July 2011."

        "content": "Victoria Azarenka edged closer to a quarterfinal clash with U.S. Open champion Samantha Stosur at the French Open but 2002 finalist Venus Williams followed sister Serena out of the Paris tournament Wednesday. Venus, a seven-time grand slam champion, has struggled with illness all season after being diagnosed with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, an incurable condition that affects energy levels and causes pain in the joints. And she was beaten 6-2 6-3 by Poland\u2019s No. 3 seed Agnieszka Radwanska to end any hopes she had of adding the French Open to her list of major titles. \u201cThis is just the beginning for me. Again. I have to be positive when I walk out on the court,\u201d she was quoted as saying on the tournament\u2019s official Twitter page. Career girl: Maria Sharapova\u2019s sweet plan for success \u201cI\u2019m not playing under ideal circumstances but at the moment it\u2019s about improving Olympic chances so I\u2019ll deal with this somehow.\u201d As for her sister\u2019s exit on Tuesday, Venus added: \u201cThankfully (Serena) has 20-something majors to keep her warm at night so she\u2019ll be alright.\u201d Radwanksa will now face Russian No. 26 seed Svetlana Kuznetsova after she beat Yung-Jan Chan from Chinese Tapei. Azarenka, the world No. 1 showed no signs of struggle in her victory German qualifier Dinah Pfizenmaier 6-1 6-1, unlike her first round scare against Alberta Brianti on Monday. The 22-year-old took just under an hour to defeat Pfizenmaier, who was competing in her first grand slam tournament, and had joked prior to the match that her opponent might not remember her name. \u201cI never knew her before but I had to do a little bit of research yesterday, and I do remember her name \u2013 it\u2019s just a little bit difficult to pronounce!\u201d Azarenka told the WTA Tour\u2019s website.  \u201cNow I know what she looks like, so hopefully I will see her many more times. It took me a few games to understand what kind of game she plays, but after a few games I started to find my rhythm. I definitely played better today. \u201cI remember myself, the first time I passed the qualifying at the French Open I was 16 years old \u2013 I was up, 6-0 3-1, and I lost the match 9-7 in the third set. \u201cI think she has big potential. She has good shots. I think she did really well today. She has a good game, so hopefully she has a good future.\u201d Azarenka, from Belarus, will now face Aleksandra Wozniak of Canada after she beat the No. 31 seed, Jie Zheng from China, 6-2 6-4. Stosur wasted little time in negotiating her way past Irina Falconi of the United States, winning 6-1 6-4. She will now face Russia\u2019s Nadia Petrova after the No. 27 seed beat Chanelle Scheepers, from South Africa, 6-3 6-3. \u201cIt\u2019s still only the third round and there is a long way to go yet before  you are holding the trophy,\u201d Stosur said. \u201cI think it\u2019s just one of those things \u2013 you have to knuckle down. I know  that I\u2019ve had good runs here in the past. Now I\u2019m up to the third step of that.\u201d The shock of the day sent a home favorite out as No. 8 seed Marion Bartoli, was beaten 6-2 3-6 6-3 by unseeded Croatian Petra Martic. Lucie Safarova, the No. 20 seed from the Czech Republic, was also ousted from the tournament, beaten 6-4 7-5 by Spain\u2019s Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez. The 2008 champion, Ana Ivanovic, seeded 13, made light work of the challenge posed by Israel\u2019s Shahar Peer, winning 6-2 6-2. No. 15 seed Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia beat Vania King of the United States 6-0 6-2 while Italy\u2019s Sara Errani, the No. 21 seed, defeated America\u2019s Melanie Oudin 6-2 6-3. There was a defeat for the No. 24 seed Petra Cetkovska, from the Czech Republic, as she slumped to a 7-6 6-2 reverse to France\u2019s Mathilde Johansson. Flavia Pennetta, the No. 18 seed made it into round three. The Italian beat Alexa Glatch, from the United States, 6-3 6-1."

        "content": "The British Supreme Court on Wednesday denied Julian Assange\u2019s appeal against extradition to Sweden over sexual abuse allegations, but the judges left open a surprise avenue for the WikiLeaks founder to fight on. Assange will take it, his legal team said, arguing that the judges made their decision based on issues that were not argued in court. Assange has been fighting for a year and a half against being sent to Sweden for questioning about accusations of sexual abuse.  Two women in Sweden accused Assange in August 2010 of sexually assaulting them during a visit to the country in connection with a WikiLeaks release of internal U.S. military documents. The Supreme Court appeared Wednesday to clear the way for him to be sent to Sweden for questioning, then unexpectedly gave his legal team two weeks to file an appeal. Assange lawyer Gareth Pierce said after the hearing that he would request a new hearing. \u201cThe majority of the judges decided that custom and practice of the European community in effect trumped the law,\u201d she said. That \u201cwas not argued in court and that in itself would be a breach of the (European Convention on Human Rights) Article 6 guarantee to a fair hearing.\u201d It is very unusual for the court to grant permission to appeal its rulings, which are supposed to be final in Britain. WikiLeaks\u2019 work is not at issue in the extradition hearing or the Swedish allegations against Assange. Assange has not been charged with a crime, but Swedish prosecutors want to question him in connection with allegations of \u201cunlawful coercion and sexual misconduct including rape,\u201d according to a Supreme Court document. Assange, who has been under house arrest in Britain since December 2010, maintains he is innocent and claims that the allegations are politically motivated. He fears that if he is extradited to Sweden, authorities there could hand him over to the United States, where he then could be prosecuted for his leaking of classified documents. In a tweet Tuesday, WikiLeaks connected Wednesday\u2019s judgment with the arrival of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Sweden, which is scheduled a few days later. \u201cHiliary Clinton and State Dept team arrive Stockhom June 3-4; 4 days after Assange extradition decision. Fanciful to think no discussion,\u201d the tweet read, misspelling both the first name of the cabinet official and of the Swedish capital. Clinton is due to make a stop in Stockholm, according to a statement on the State Department website, on a swing through six countries. Discussions about Internet freedom are included on the agenda. Assange\u2019s lawyers fought the extradition on appeal via a legal technicality involving the arrest warrant.  They argued that the \u201cEuropean Arrest Warrant\u201d issued for Assange is invalid because it was issued by a Swedish prosecutor, whom they say is not an independent and impartial judicial authority.   His lawyers earlier vowed to take their fight all the way to the European Court of Human Rights if the Supreme Court denies the appeal. Two women Assange had sexual relations with in Sweden in August 2010 subsequently went to police, who took down their complaints, according the Britain\u2019s Supreme Court. Police then interviewed Assange. The WikiLeaks founder left Sweden \u201cin ignorance of the fact that a domestic arrest warrant had been issued for him,\u201d according to the U.K. high court. A Swedish court granted a warrant for his \u201cdetention for interrogation,\u201d and Swedish prosecutors issued a European Arrest Warrant for his detention in the U.K. WikiLeaks, which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information, has published some 250,000 confidential U.S. diplomatic cables, causing embarrassment to the government and others. It has also published hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. documents relating to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. But the organization has come under financial pressure, leading Assange to announce that WikiLeaks was temporarily stopping publication to \u201caggressively fund raise\u201d in order to stay afloat. An announcement at the top of WikiLeaks\u2019 home page reads: \u201cWe are forced to put all our efforts into raising funds to ensure our economic survival.\u201d During his wait for the Supreme Court to rule on his extradition, Assange has hosted a talk show on Russian TV. \u201cThe World Tomorrow\u201d appears on the Kremlin-funded, pro-Russian network Russia Today. He hosts it from the Suffolk mansion where he is under house arrest, with an electronic bracelet monitoring his movements. He has interviewed controversial figures at odds with the U.S. government including Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, which the United States considers a terrorist organization, and Ecuador\u2019s president Rafael Correa, who railed against the United States in his interview with Assange."

The prosecutor\u2019s office in the province of Modena, where the quake was centered, opened an investigation Wednesday into the cause of death of the quake victims, many of whom were factory workers. Investigators will examine how the factories were built and why they couldn\u2019t withstand an earthquake of Tuesday\u2019s magnitude. Modena\u2019s chief prosecutor, Vito Zincani, told CNN that as modern buildings, they should have remained standing. Most of the modern structures in the area were not damaged, he said, so the fact that some factories collapsed \u201cshows an anomaly that needs investigation.\u201d Look at high-resolution images of the disaster The earthquake, which forced thousands of people from their homes, came nine days after a 6.0-magnitude quake struck the same region, killing seven people. Tuesday\u2019s quake, which struck at about 9 a .m. local when many people had begun work, was followed by dozens of aftershocks. The U.S. Geological Survey recorded one of 5.6 magnitude. Italian ministers met Wednesday morning and decided on several measures to be taken in the aftermath of the quake. The government declared a state of emergency in the quake area and set June 4 as a national day of mourning, according to a press statement. An extra two-cent tax will also be added to gasoline to help finance the recovery effort, it said. Italy\u2019s President Giorgio Napolitano, Prime Minister Mario Monti and the speakers of both Italian houses of parliament on the earthquake met later Wednesday at the presidential palace in Rome to discuss the disaster. The towns of Mirandola and Cavezzo, northwest of the city of Bologna, were closest to the epicenter, civil protection authorities said. Witnesses reported on Twitter that Cavezzo was about 70% destroyed. Pictures purportedly from the town, as well as a video stream from Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, show damaged and destroyed buildings. Churches and historic structures were among the affected buildings. In the small town of Novi di Modena, a 65-year-old priest died inside his church as he tried to save its statue of the Madonna. Construction workers who were out surveying the damage in Medolla were emotional as they spoke of their experiences a day earlier. Mohmammed Mouhalhal told CNN he was at work when the earthquake struck. He and his fellow construction workers now fear for their jobs and their safety, he said.  He said no one could sleep Tuesday night and they stayed outside for fear of further quakes. Some 50 tremors were felt in the area overnight. Italian authorities are still assessing the economic impact of the earthquakes on the region, which lies in northern Italy, the heartland of the country\u2019s manufacturing industry. Leaders of agricultural and industrial organizations, speaking to Italian media, have estimated the cost of the disaster at nearly one billion euros. The Italian daily newspaper Repubblica puts the damage to the biomedical industry in Medolla alone at about \u20ac600 million ($751 million). Many cheese makers are also among those affected. Stefano Berni, president of the consortium that makes Grana Padano, a hard cheese similar to Parmesan, told CNN that some 350,000 whole cheeses, each weighing 40 kilograms (88 pounds), had been shaken to the ground. No more than 40% of those are likely to be salvageable, he said, leading to estimated losses of \u20ac70 million ($88 million). About 600 cheese producers located in the area north of the earthquake epicenter have suffered damage to their production centers and warehouses, he said. About 50,000 families, including the milk producers and cheese makers, work for the industry. Other factories and warehouses that have not been damaged by the quake will still suffer losses because they have had to halt production for safety checks. Geophysicist Antonio Piersanti, of the National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology, told Corriere della Sera  that it was possible more earthquakes could follow in the coming weeks. The last significant earthquake in this area was in 1571. It was followed by about four years of aftershocks. "

        "content": "Euro 2012 hosts Ukraine and Poland have told CNN World Sport a documentary accusing football fans from both nations of racism was \u201cunbalanced and biased.\u201d An investigation by UK television channel the BBC featured right-wing supporters from both countries displaying racist and anti-Semitic attitudes. Footage also appeared to show soccer fans at a match in Ukraine targeting Asian supporters with violence. Former England defender Sol Campbell warned fans not to travel to Poland or Ukraine after seeing the pictures and questioned why both countries were awarded the tournament in the first place. Are Poland and Ukraine ready to host festival of football? But speaking to CNN World Sport, representatives from the governments of Ukraine and Poland said the show was misleading. \u201cWhat was aired, in my personal opinion, is unbalanced and biased reporting about the situation in Ukraine,\u201d Volodymyr Khandogiy, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the UK, said. \u201cI would like to say we do not in Ukraine have a problem of that magnitude as it appeared on the screen. \u201cRacism and racial ideology is against the law and if those young fans were shouting anything close to Nazi slogans they would have been prosecuted. Racism, rather than Ronaldo and Ribery, dominates Euro 2012 storylines \u201cUkraine is very well known for its tolerance and it has a long history of living together with other nationalities. In our national football championship, roughly half of all the players are from Asian, African and Brazilian countries.\u201d The Panorama episode broadcast footage filmed at matches in both Poland and Ukraine that purported to show fans displaying Nazi salutes in the stands and aiming monkey chants at black players. Family members of two players in the England squad \u2013 Arsenal pair Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain \u2013 have already said they won\u2019t be going to the tournament due to fears over racism. But Marcin Bosacki, Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman, told CNN the program was \u201ccheap journalism.\u201d He said: \u201cThere is a problem with racism and anti-Semitism in Poland but it is blown out of every possible proportion in this material. Italian PM: Suspend Italian soccer leagues \u201cThey interviewed many people with balanced opinions and they complained today that their voices were not used in this program. \u201cDo you know how many British tourists come to Poland evry year? 500,000. And do you know how many reports they gave to the British Embassy and consulates about racism in the last three years? Zero. \u201cWe are hospitable and treat all people who come here as friends.\u201d UEFA claim taking high-profile tournaments to different places in Europe helps to tackle any problems regarding discrimination in the host country. In a statement, soccer\u2019s European governing body said: \u201cUEFA Euro 2012 brings the spotlight on the host countries and clearly creates an opportunity to address and confront such societal issues. \u201cUEFA\u2019s \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 approach to racism is still valid both on and off the pitch and ultimately the referee has the power to stop or abandon a match should racist incidents occur.\u201d Piara Power, executive director of the Football Against Racism in Europe organization, said there was still plenty of work to be done in both Poland and Ukraine. \u201cI think we know the situation in domestic football in both Poland and Ukraine and I\u2019m afraid the documentary hit the nail on the head \u2013 it\u2019s a very bad situation,\u201d he said. \u201cNevertheless there is some good work going at grass roots level to make sure that Euro 2012 inside stadiums does not resemble the sort of scenes we saw in the documentary.\u201d Powar said that although the BBC\u2019s documentary had provoked a strong reaction in the UK, other countries involved in Euro 2012 would be concerned that UEFA do all they can to ensure a safe tournament. \u201cThere will be mixed teams in the Netherlands, Germany, the French have a lot of black players,\u201d he added. \u201cI think all of those teams will be looking at themselves and saying what sort of safety precautions do we need to take? Do our relatives travel or do they stay behind and how do we respond to possible outbreaks of racism? \u201cWe have a procedure with UEFA to deal with these sort of issues and we\u2019re fairly clear that it\u2019s a good procedure.  \u201cIt will work in the right way and I think we\u2019ll see a lot of teams and their fans probably getting sanctioned quite heavily by UEFA by the end of the tournament.\u201d"

The world No. 2 took his impressive record at Roland Garros to 46 victories and just one defeat with a 6-2 6-2 6-1 win, as he goes in search of an 11th grand slam title. Should he claim another French Open crown he will pull level with legendary Swede Bjorn Borg and Australian Rod Laver in the all-time list. But despite the comfortable nature of his victory, save for a losing his serve at the start of the second set, Nadal insisted he had to fight off some nervous moments in the early stages. \u201cAll matches are always difficult \u2013 the more so here, as you are a bit more nervous,\u201d he told a press conference.  \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to get your bearings right off as the court is big and it\u2019s difficult out there. But I\u2019m always happy to play here \u2013 it\u2019s an incredible feeling. \u201cI\u2019m happy. I played, probably, with less stress or nerves than in other first rounds in the past.  \u201cI relaxed a little bit at 6-2, 4-0, in my opinion. I was playing very well at beginning of the match. After I had the break (at 2-2), that period of of eight, nine games, until 4-0, I was playing well.\u201d The 25-year-old can boast 35 trophies on clay in his career, behind only Argentina\u2019s Guillermo Vilas (45 titles) and Austrian Thomas Muster (40) in the all-time list. The No. 4 seed Andy Murray battled through a second set blip to record a 6-1 7-5 6-0 victory over Japan\u2019s Tatsuma Ito. Murray, from Britain, had to save three break points in the eighth game of the second, but lost just six points in the whole of the third set. The 25-year-old pulled out of the recent Rome Masters with a back injury but showed no signs of discomfort as he set up a second round clash with Finland\u2019s Jarkko Nieminen. Spain\u2019s David Ferrer, the No. 6 seed, had little trouble against Slovakia\u2019s Lukas Lacko, winning 6-3 6-4 6-1 but Serbia\u2019s Janko Tipsarevic was made to work harder in a 2-6 6-4 7-6 6-3 success over American Sam Querrey. Another Spaniard, No. 12 seed Nicolas Almagro, booked his place in round two with a 6-3 7-5 6-4 defeat of Italian Paolo Lorenzi. Alexandr Dolgopolov, the No. 16 seed, was knocked out by fellow Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky, who triumphed 6-7 6-4 7-6 3-6 6-3. France\u2019s No. 17 seed Richard Gasquet progressed into round two with a 6-3 6-4 7-6 victory over Estonia\u2019s Jurgen Zopp. "

But if you are one of the world\u2019s wealthiest golf stars, it is an investment you can seriously consider. And it would seem four-time major winner Phil Mickelson is pondering such a purchase, after the California native revealed he is part of a group considering a bid for the San Diego Padres Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. \u201cI\u2019ve had the opportunity to invest in other sports franchises, and I\u2019ve turned it down in the past,\u201d the 41-year-old told the San Diego Union-Tribune website. Donald wins to return back to the top of the world rankings \u201cThis was a unique opportunity with families that had done this before and know how to do it right and want to get involved in the community.\u201d Mickelson, who was born in San Diego, is the second-highest earner on the PGA Tour, having amassed winnings of $66 million since turning pro in 1992. According to the financial magazine Forbes, the three-time Masters champion pocketed $48 million in winnings, endorsement and other income between May 2011 and May 2012 \u2013 making him the sixth highest earner in sport.

        "content": "In 2005, Brian Baker was one of the rising stars of American tennis. Aged just 20, he recorded a shock win over world No. 9 Gaston Gaudio at the U.S. Open. Despite being beaten in the second round, the future looked bright for the Tennessee native. However, it was to be his last match at a grand slam tournament for seven years as a nightmare series of injuries and operations threatened to end his promising career. \u201cI was the No. 2-ranked junior in the world,\u201d Baker told CNN\u2019s Open Court. \u201cI was hoping to start off with a bang on the ATP Tour and have a successful career, whether top 50, top 10 or top 20.\u201d Instead, he had to have five surgeries in four years. And until recently, his only involvement in tennis was playing on the low-ranking Challenger Tour and coaching his college team. Roddick exits early at French Open As well as elbow and hernia injuries, the root of Baker\u2019s fitness problems lie with a hip condition which has troubled him since he was a boy. \u201cFemoroacetabular Impingement is a developmental condition that has to do with the way his hip formed when he was probably nine or 10 years old,\u201d Doctor Thomas Byrd told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s an overgrowth around the socket where the femoral head grows out, sort of like the front end of your car being a little out of alignment. It leads to some uneven wear inside the hip. \u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable to me he was able to reach such an elite status in the first place. He was spending as much time battling his hips as he was his opponent.\u201d But now Baker is back on the big stage, having made a remarkable comeback. On Wednesday, the 27-year-old will play in the second round of a grand slam for the second time in his career. Learn more about Baker\u2019s next French Open opponent Having been awarded a wildcard entry to the French Open after winning a Challenger tournament in April, Baker reached his first ATP Tour final at a warmup event in Nice last weekend. He lost that match, but won his opener at Roland Garros on Monday against the man who beat him in New York in 2005, Belgium\u2019s world No. 77 Xavier Malisse. Baker next faces a much tougher test against French 11th seed Gilles Simon, but his family are just glad to see him back out on the court enjoying himself. \u201cI was just so happy for him because that\u2019s what he\u2019d worked all this time to go back for,\u201d said his father Steve. \u201cNow that he\u2019s done that we hope to have a good time in Paris. \u201cWe\u2019ve watched him play in grand slam matches before; it\u2019s not the first time. I always thought I would one day go to see him play in Roland Garros.\u201d The famous clay-court venue holds special memories for Baker, who reached the 2003 French Open boys\u2019 final before losing to Switzerland\u2019s Stanislaw Wawrinka \u2013 who has since enjoyed a steady career and is ranked 21st in the world. While players such as Marcos Baghdatis and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga \u2013 both of whom he beat during that Roland Garros run \u2013 were winning titles and climbing the rankings, Baker was trying to rescue his fading career. \u201cI think Marcus beat me a couple of times, but I got the better of him a few more times,\u201d Baker told CNN. \u201cThat was right when I was coming back from my first hip surgery. \u201cI had no idea I was going to have four more surgeries \u2026 I can\u2019t remember who he beat, (David) Nalbandian and somebody else. It definitely gave me some motivation \u2013 maybe if I come back I could have some good results.\u201d Baker\u2019s return gained real momentum in Nice. Before losing to defending champion Nicolas Almagro in the final, he scored notable wins over former junior rival and world No. 14 Gael Monfils and Russia\u2019s former No. 3 Nikolay Davydenko, a 21-time title winner on the ATP Tour. \u201cEvery time you go onto court you want to win,\u201d Baker told the ATP Tour\u2019s official website after his final defeat. \u201cI am a competitor, I hate losing. But, when you look at the week as a whole, it has been an unbelievable week.  \u201cI hoped to qualify at the start of the week and win a match or two before going to Roland Garros. I obviously did much better.  \u201cI think even in the qualifying, I felt as if I was playing pretty well. I won my three matches easily and knew I was playing good tennis.\u201d Baker\u2019s compatriot John Isner, ranked 11th in the world, is pleased to see his former junior rival back competing at the highest level. \u201cWe are virtually the exact same age,\u201d Isner told CNN. \u201cWe were born days apart in and played in the juniors, he was hands down one of the best players in the country. \u201cHe definitely deserves it and he has worked really hard.  And he hasn\u2019t let all of these obstacles discourage him.   \u201cHe is still doing what he loves and that is playing tennis \u2013 and he is doing very well. You know, without more injuries and if he can stay healthy, I can see him in the top 100.\u201d"

The 13-time major champion lost an epic three-hour duel 4-6 7-6 6-3 to her unseeded French opponent, who suffered from cramp through most of the match. It was Williams\u2019 47th grand slam tournament and her earliest exit since sister Venus beat her in the second round of her first major \u2013 the Australian Open in 1998. Razzano, the world 111, squandered seven match points in a final game that lasted over 20 minutes and was penalized twice for crying out in pain during a rally. Career girl: Maria Sharapova\u2019s sweet plan for success But despite being hampered by her injury she managed to close out the game, backed by a vociferous home crowd, and shrieked in delight as she recorded the biggest victory of her career. The 29-year-old lost her fiancee and coach Stephane Vidal after a long battle with cancer prior to last year\u2019s tournament.

And the Russian looked in merciless mood on Court Suzanne Lenglen as she set up a second round clash with Japan\u2019s Ayumi Morita. \u201cNothing is ever easy, because you have to face whoever is across the net,\u201d Sharapova told a press conference.  \u201cNo matter how good or bad they\u2019re playing, you still have to win that match. That was just my goal today. \u201cI\u2019m really happy with the way my preparation has been coming into this tournament. I feel like with every year I\u2019ve improved and enjoy it much more.  \u201cEvery year I learn a lot more about the game and point construction. I feel like I\u2019m moving a lot better than I did years previously, which has helped me a lot in the recovery process within the point.  \u201cAll of that gives me a lot of confidence for this tournament.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been a solid year. I started the year off on a really good note. I was healthy. I had a pretty good off-season, I would say. I was practicing well.  \u201cIt hasn\u2019t actually been as long as I\u2019ve wanted it to be because of the ankle, but I started off with really good, high energy. I was really positive, and it\u2019s paying off.\u201d Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, the No. 4 seed, also enjoyed a comfortable passage into round two.  The Czech defeated 16-year-old Australian Ashleigh Barty 6-1 6-2 in just under an hour and will face Poland\u2019s Urszula Radwanska in the next round.

Italian civil protection authorities said two of Tuesday\u2019s deaths were not directly caused by the quake. Tuesday\u2019s quake was followed by dozens of aftershocks. The U.S. Geological Survey recorded one aftershock of 5.6 magnitude. Look at high-res images of the disaster The quakes have displaced some 14,000 people, the civil protection agency said. Tuesday\u2019s earthquake was centered in the province of Modena, near Bologna. The towns of Mirandola and Cavezzo were closest to the epicenter, civil protection authorities said. Witnesses reported on Twitter that Cavezzo was about 70% destroyed. Pictures purportedly from the town, as well as a video stream from Italian newspaper Corriere de la Serra, show damaged and destroyed buildings. \u201cPeople are very scared. It\u2019s been shaking nonstop for the past week,\u201d said journalist Andrea Vogt, who was near the epicenter. The earthquakes have been \u201ca real shock,\u201d she said, adding that no residents she spoke with could remember so many quakes in such a short period of time. \u201cFactories were full,\u201d said Vogt, a freelancer based in Bologna. \u201cMany of the workers were working on repairs to the already damaged buildings.\u201d  A spokeswoman for the government office in Modena said as many as 12,000 people could be displaced, including those affected by the previous earthquake. \u201cDamages are very serious. The old centers of many villages have been closed down to (the) public and many little villages have been completely evacuated,\u201d she said. Authorities were setting up tents to house those forced from their homes, she said, and hotels and campsites were offering space to those in need. The Italian railway company was sending eight coaches \u2013 expected to shelter 400 people \u2013 to the village of Crevalcore, near Bologna, the civil protection agency said. At the time of Tuesday\u2019s quake, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti was meeting with the head of the civil protection agency and the governor of the region to discuss the previous quake. \u201cThe state will do all what needs to be done, in the quickest way, to assure the return to normal life to such a special and productive region of the country,\u201d Monti said in a televised statement. The quake response was expected to be among the issues discussed at a Cabinet meeting scheduled for 9 a.m. Wednesday. Some buildings that were damaged in last week\u2019s earthquake were further damaged on Tuesday, a spokeswoman said. \u201cSan Felice sul Panaro and Mirandola registered most of the damage,\u201d she added. Violetta Galia said she was afraid to remain in Bologna. \u201cWe\u2019ve been having many quakes, so it\u2019s not safe to go back to work. We are having problems with communications, so it\u2019s not easy to get in contact with somebody by phone,\u201d she told CNN via Skype. \u201cI don\u2019t feel safe \u2013 I need to go away, I don\u2019t want to live (in) Bologna. If I don\u2019t leave Bologna, I will never feel safe because we are still having quakes every three or five minutes.\u201d CNN iReporter Martina Lunardelli, a freelance translator and interpreter, said she was at work in Pieve di Soligo, Italy, when she felt the earthquake. She said she heard \u201cthat thunder sound and my head spinning fast, as if I was drunk and could not see the others around since they were out of focus. I felt so strange.\u201d A spokeswoman for the prefecture in Ferrara province said people were in need of urgent help.  \u201cWe need tents. The number of displaced is increasing. It will take time to check if homes are safe, and also people are terrified and don\u2019t want to sleep in their houses,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had enormous damage to all our factories, and there will be dramatic consequences on employment.\u201d The area\u2019s cultural heritage has also suffered, she said, with two churches destroyed in the village of Cento and another church facade collapsing. Authorities face an additional logistical challenge in helping local communities because emergency supplies were already depleted from the response to the earlier quake. Some railway routes were affected by the earthquake, but Trenitalia, the Italian train system, said late Tuesday afternoon that all had been reopened and that train service was returning to normal. Earlier in the day, some high-speed services from Bologna to Milan and Florence, among others, were running slower than usual. Northern Italy is the heartland of the country\u2019s manufacturing industry. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have an economic impact as well as a human impact,\u201d Vogt said of the earthquake."

        "content": "One of the hottest properties in European football, Eden Hazard, has ended months of speculation as to his future by announcing on Twitter he is to join Champions League winners Chelsea. The 21-year-old Belgium international is poised to leave French side Lille and took to the micro-blogging site to reveal his next destination, though the London club haven\u2019t yet confirmed the transfer. Hazard won the French league title in 2011 and has scored 20 goals for the club this season. His form attracted attention from a host of clubs including English Premier League champions Manchester City and deposed rivals Manchester United. After a cryptic message on Monday morning when he took to Twitter to announce he had made up his mind, Hazard then later posted: \u201cI\u2019m signing for the champion\u2019s league winner.\u201d Reinventing the wheel: How Guardiola revolutionized football Chelsea secured their first Champions League crown with a dramatic penalty shootout victory over German club Bayern Munich earlier this month. It sealed a remarkable end to a difficult season in which Portuguese manager Andre Villas-Boas was sacked in March, just nine months after he arrived from Porto. Villas-Boas\u2019 assistant Roberto Di Matteo \u2013 a former Chelsea player \u2013 took over and led the club to two trophies, winning the English FA Cup two weeks before the Champions League final. Despite his success, Chelsea are yet to confirm whether Di Matteo will stay on beyond his temporary contract, which expires at the end of June. In a further boost for the club, goalkeeper Petr Cech, who saved three penalties in the Champions League shootout, has signed a new four-year deal. The Czech keeper has already made more appearances than any other foreign player in the London club\u2019s history, representing Chelsea 369 times. Since joining in 2004 he has won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups and two League Cups. He was instrumental in Chelsea\u2019s Champions League campaign. \u201cI am really happy to be part of this great club for another four years,\u201d Cech told the club\u2019s official website. \u201cI hope the next four years will be as successful as the last eight years I have been at the club.\u201d Chief executive Ron Gourlay added: \u201cChelsea fully appreciates the highly significant contribution Petr has made to the most successful period in the club\u2019s history, and it is very important to our aim of continuing this level of achievement that he has committed himself to the club until 2016. \u201cIt is clear to anyone who watched the climax to the season just completed that Petr continues to perform as well as any goalkeeper in the world.\u201d"

        "content": "Italian police descended on the national team\u2019s Euro 2012 training base Monday to speak to Zenit St Petersburg defender Domenico Criscito as part of a wide-ranging investigation into match fixing. The 25-year-old, formerly of Genoa, was questioned by officials probing gambling markets linked to fixing results of matches in the Italian top flight. A total of 19 people were arrested in the ongoing investigation by magistrates in Cremona, 11 of them players in Italy\u2019s top division. Juventus coach Antonio Conte, who led the club to the Serie A title last season, was spoken to by police, while Lazio\u2019s captain Stefano Mauri was arrested. Juventus defiant in match-fix controversy As a result of the dawn raid on Italy\u2019s training camp at Coverciano, near Florence, Criscito decided to withdraw from the forthcoming Euro 2012 tournament in Poland and Ukraine. Italian Football Federation (FIGC) vice-president Demetrio Albertini said Criscito was hugely disappointed to miss out but that he quit in order to protect the rest of the squad.  \u201cCriscito decided not to join Italy at the Euros. The tournament is no longer his priority, he wants to get in touch with the prosecutors as soon as possible to clear his position,\u201d Albertini said.  \u201cWe are with him, we believe in his innocence: until no evidence is proved, he should be considered innocent.\u201d Prosecutors said the left-back was seen in a restaurant with match fixing suspects during his time at Genoa but the player has also protested his innocence. Criscito\u2019s agent Andrea D\u2019Amico said: \u201cCriscito is calm but very surprised. He just joined a dinner with fans, a meeting asked by fans after the derby Genoa lost to Sampdoria in 2011.  \u201cHe didn\u2019t know any of the ultras involved. He can\u2019t understand how he could be connected to this story. As soon as possible he will ask prosecutors to be interrogated.\u201d Roberto Di Martino, chief prosecutor in the case, told a press conference the police\u2019s swoop on Italy\u2019s base was solely related to Criscito. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t place too much emphasis on the blitz at Coverciano,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a problem that concerns only Criscito and not other players in the national team at the moment. \u201cAlso we shouldn\u2019t place too much emphasis on this anyway, the notification of an impending investigation is a tool we have, but not a guilty judgment. There\u2019s been no action taken against Criscito travelling, he can play at the Euros easily.\u201d Police said Juve manager Conte was being quizzed in relation to sporting fraud accusations relating to a match played by Siena, the club he used to coach. Conte\u2019s lawyer said his client was completely innocent. Siena\u2019s president, Massimo Mezzaroma, has also been placed under investigation. Di Martino added: \u201cThere are seven, eight games being looked at and there have been statements that make us think they were manipulated. The searches involved players, coaches and directors of the club, including Conte and Mezzaroma.\u201d Di Martino also revealed the investigation was spreading beyond Italian borders, with five people arrested in Hungary. \u201cWe have evidence that this Hungarian gang worked to fix in Serie A 2010-11 the games between Bari and Sampdoria, Lecce and Lazio and some others.  \u201cWe have different evidence of their presence in Italy and of their contacts with people from Singapore, where the money is coming from.\u201d The arrests are the latest in a long running saga that has cast a shadow over Italian football. In 2006 the Calciopoli match fixing scandal saw Juventus relegated to the second tier and stripped of two league titles. Seventeen people were arrested in a similar swoop last year, the most high-profile of which was Atalanta captain Cristiano Doni. He was subsequently banned from the game for three years. Giovanni Trapattoni, who coached the Italian national team for four years, said the latest twist represented \u201cdevastating news.\u201d Trapattoni, who now coaches Ireland, said: \u201cWhat could be the Italian team\u2019s reaction? On one side it is clear that news like this can bring people down, but it could also push them to show the clean face of football. \u201cAs someone who has been abroad for years it\u2019s a pity that these things cast a dark shadow over our football.\u201d"

        "content": "Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s spokesman denied Monday that a cardinal or a woman were being investigated alongside the pope\u2019s butler on suspicion of leaking confidential documents. \u201cI firmly deny the reports of a cardinal being also involved in the investigations, as well as the reports of a woman allegedly also involved,\u201d the Rev. Federico Lombardi told CNN. Butler Paolo Gabriele has been formally charged with aggravated theft for allegedly stealing private documents, Lombardi said. Gabriele was arrested on suspicion of leaking confidential papers to an Italian journalist, the Vatican said Saturday. The formal investigation is ongoing, Lombardi said Monday, refusing to comment on how long it will last. Gabriele, 46, was arrested Wednesday, accused of illegal possession of confidential documents, found in his apartment in Vatican territory, the Vatican said in a statement issued three days later.  Gabriele, who has worked as the papal butler since 2006, is one of only a handful of people with access to the pontiff\u2019s private desk. We recommend: Leaders of U.S. Catholic nuns to address Vatican reprimand about \u2018radical\u2019 feminism His job included handing out rosaries to dignitaries and riding in the front seat of the \u201cPopemobile,\u201d a vehicle used for public papal appearances, as seen in many photographs showing Gabriele with the pope. Last month, the Vatican gave Cardinal Julian Herranz a \u201cpontifical mandate\u201d to uncover the source of hundreds of personal letters and confidential documents that have been released to Gianluigi Nuzzi, an Italian journalist and author of \u201cSua Santita,\u201d a book that translates to \u201cHis Holiness\u201d and includes the documents.  Nuzzi would not confirm the identity of his sources, but he told CNN that his primary source \u2013 whom he referred to as \u201cMaria\u201d in his book \u2013 \u201crisked life and limb\u201d if ever found out.  The source worked inside the Vatican, according to Nuzzi, who refused to give other details such as the source\u2019s gender, age and if he or she was clergy or not. Nuzzi told CNN that he has not been questioned in connection with the arrest. The Vatican called the publication of his book \u201ccriminal\u201d when it was released last Saturday in Italian. Feltrenelli and Mondadori booksellers both rank the book at No. 1 in sales within Italy. Nuzzi\u2019s book highlights an internal power struggle within the Vatican through numerous documents including faxes, personal letters and inter-Vatican memos. He told CNN that he received the documents during a year of private meetings in secret locations.  We recommend: Missing girl\u2019s brother urges Vatican to open up The documents show that allegations of corruption and money laundering were a concern for a number of high-ranking prelates, including Carlo Maria Vigano, who is now the papal nuncio in Washington, D.C.  Vigano wrote in a series of letters to the pope that he was concerned about the spread of corruption and that his move to Washington would stir speculation.   \u201cHoly Father, my transfer at this time would provoke much disorientation and discouragement in those who have believed it was possible to clean up so many situations of corruption and abuse of power that have been rooted in the management of so many departments,\u201d according to his letter, which was published in the book.  The Vatican has not denied the authenticity of the documents, but instead says the breach of privacy is a criminal act.  The 108-acre city-state has its own judicial system, distinct from the Italian judicial system. CNN senior Vatican analyst John Allen pointed out that its courts normally prosecute the likes of pickpockets, \u201cnot alleged moles.\u201d Thus, the Vatican doesn\u2019t have facilities to incarcerate anyone on a long-term basis, and the civil and criminal penalties it typically metes out are limited, Allen said Saturday. He speculated that, for these and other reasons, the Vatican may ask \u2013 assuming that it determines there is enough evidence against Gabriele \u2013 that any such trial occur within the Italian judicial system. \u201cThe question then would become: Does the Italian government want to pick that (trial) up?\u201d said Allen, a senior correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter. \u201cIn addition to being an embarrassing scandal for the Vatican on its own terms, this also has the potential to become \u2026 a diplomatic contretemps.\u201d For now, Gabriele is being held in a special cell within Vatican City, a walled enclave within Rome, according to Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi.  Lombardi said the pope was \u201csaddened and shocked\u201d about the arrest. The Vatican said the first phase of its preliminary investigation, under chief prosecutor Nicola Picardi, has ended.  An investigating judge, Piero Antonio Bonnet, is leading the next stage of the investigation, which could lead to a trial or acquittal. Gabriele has appointed two lawyers of his choice to act at the Vatican Tribunal, and has had a chance to meet them, the Vatican statement said.  \u201cHe enjoys all the legal guarantees provided by the criminal code and criminal procedure in force in the State of Vatican City,\u201d it added."

Mark Webber clinched the Austrian-owned manufacturer\u2019s third consecutive win in the principality on Sunday, but questions have been asked about the legality of Red Bull\u2019s RB8 car. The debate centers around the floor of the car, specifically the area in front of the rear wheel. The FIA, the body which regulates the sport, states the floor of an F1 car must be impervious, a rule many teams presumed meant it must be free of holes. The official rule is as follows: \u201cAll parts lying on the reference and step planes, in addition to the transition between the two planes, must produce uniform, solid, hard, continuous, rigid (no degree of freedom in relation to the body/chassis unit), impervious surfaces under all circumstances.\u201d Webber wins Monaco Grand Prix But the RB8\u2019s design, which has been cleared by FIA scrutineers and has been running since April\u2019s Bahrain Grand Prix, features a rectangular slot in front of the rear wheel of the car. \u201cIn Monaco there was much discussion about the legality of the Red Bull\u2019s floor, with speculation that rival teams were considering lodging post-race protests (none ultimately did),\u201d read a statement on the sport\u2019s official website.  \u201cDespite the fact that Red Bull have been running the design since Bahrain with the blessing of the FIA scrutineers.\u201d The slot  increases downforce at the rear of the vehicle by offsetting the negative impact the rear wheel has on airflow over the car. Latest F1 standings after Monaco GP And the Red Bull is not the only car to feature a modification aimed at tackling this problem. Both the Ferrari and Sauber cars feature slots in front of the rear wheel. But on both designs the slot it is placed at the edge of the body, rather than being an isolated hole in the floor. The design tweaks have clearly paid dividends. Red Bull currently lead the constructors\u2019 championship, with its drivers Sebastian Vettel and Webber second and third respectively in the drivers\u2019 standings, while Ferrari\u2019s two-time world champion Fernando Alonso is top. With no team launching an official protest, the RB8, complete with slot, can be expected on the grid for the Canadian Grand Prix on June 10. "

        "content": "Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair came under \u201cpolitical pressure\u201d from media baron Rupert Murdoch during his time in office, he testified Monday at an independent inquiry set up in response to phone hacking and alleged police bribery at Murdoch newspapers in Britain. Asked if he was \u201ctoo cozy\u201d with Murdoch, as current Prime Minister David Cameron says many in the British political establishment have been, Blair denied it. Ex-Cameron aide Coulson testifies at UK hacking inquiry  \u201cCoziness is not quite the way I would put it. You were in a position where you were dealing with very powerful people,\u201d he said, elaborating on the power of the British press, a theme he referred to frequently.  \u201cIf they were against you, they were all-out against you.\u201d Separately, London police announced the arrest of a 42-year-old woman in connection with their probe into phone hacking.  The woman was arrested Monday morning on suspicion of money laundering, police said without naming the woman. The arrest came as Blair was testifying at the Leveson Inquiry into British press ethics. He said the relationship between the press and politicians is complicated. \u201cThe relationship is one in which you feel this pretty intense power,\u201d he said. But he said his government had not acted on behalf of Murdoch\u2019s business interests. \u201cActually we decided more stuff against the Murdoch interest than in favor of it,\u201d Blair said. \u201cPressure from him was more political than commercial.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t lobby me on media stuff,\u201d Blair said, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s not to say that we didn\u2019t know what his position was. But the bulk of our conversations were about politics.\u201d He confirmed that he is the godfather of one of Murdoch\u2019s children, but said that is because his relationship with the media magnate changed once he was no longer prime minister. \u201cI would never have become godfather to one of his children on the basis of my relationship with him while I was in office,\u201d he said, but their relations became \u201ceasier\u201d after he stepped down in 2007. He briefly addressed his trip to meet Murdoch on Hayman Island in 1995, while he was campaigning to become prime minister, and agreed with his former aide Alastair Campbell that he was \u201cangered\u201d to have to do it. Murdoch\u2019s best-selling Sun tabloid famously switched allegiance from the Conservative party to Blair\u2019s Labour party before the 1997 election that swept Blair into power. But Murdoch insisted strongly that there had been no quid pro quo with Blair for the support of his papers in 1997. \u201cI, in 10 years in his power there, never asked Tony Blair for any favors and never received any,\u201d Murdoch said in April, pounding his hand on the table for emphasis. On Monday, Blair said he believed Murdoch himself made the decisions about who his British newspapers supported, not underlings. He said that as party leader, he had paid a great deal of attention to how the Labour party got its message out, portraying it as a necessary part of contemporary politics. And he said he had decided not to take on the power of the press. \u201cI took a strategic decision to manage these people, not confront them. You would have been in a huge battle with no guarantee of winning,\u201d he said. Blair\u2019s testimony was briefly interrupted by a protester shouting: \u201cThis man is a war criminal!\u201d The man identified himself to CNN as David Lawley-Wakelin, who made a documentary film called \u201cThe Alternative Iraq Inquiry.\u201d He accused Blair of taking money from the bank JP Morgan for the invasion of Iraq, a charge Blair made a point of denying once the protester was removed. It took three security officers to pull him out of the courtroom. The protester appeared directly behind Brian Leveson, prompting the shaken-looking judge to say there would be an immediate inquiry into how the man got into a secure area. The protester appeared to be wearing some kind of pass. The Leveson Inquiry was established after British public anger at Murdoch\u2019s News of the World about the hacking of voice messages of a missing teenage girl who turned out to have been murdered. The case of Milly Dowler came on top of apologies from the tabloid for the hacking of the phones of celebrities and politicians, and proved to be the last straw for the paper, which was shut down in July. Cameron set up the Leveson Inquiry to explore press ethics in Britain more widely, alongside police investigations into phone hacking, e-mail hacking and police bribery by people working for Murdoch\u2019s British newspapers. More than 50 people have been arrested. Prosecutors this month announced charges against six people, including Rebekah Brooks, a former News of the World and Sun editor who later became chief executive of News International, the British newspaper publishing arm of Murdoch\u2019s News Corp. She, her husband and four others are charged with interfering with the police investigation. Blair\u2019s former director of communications said this month that the relationship between the press and the political elite in Britain was too cozy. \u201cI\u2019ve been arguing for some years (that the relationship) got itself into a very, very bad place, and I hope it can lead to change,\u201d Alastair Campbell  told CNNI\u2019s Christiane Amanpour. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about Rupert Murdoch,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of newspapers in a geographically fairly small country. \u2026 And I think any political leader has to take account of the role they play in the political debate.\u201d Campbell, a former newspaper editor who became Blair\u2019s spokesman when the Labour party was in opposition in the 1990s, said he hoped \u201csome form of proper regulation\u201d would arise from the hacking and bribery scandal."

Guardiola has built on Barca\u2019s pure football principles with a totalitarian approach to \u201ctiki taka,\u201d a style reliant on short passing and dynamic movement, and the results have helped an already successful unit transcend a higher plane. Guardiola signs off in style as Barca win Copa del Rey Guardiola\u2019s vision has been enshrined by fellow disciples of Barcelona\u2019s famed La Masia youth academy, players like influential Spanish pair Andres Iniesta and Xavi, as well as prolific striker Lionel Messi. They have helped him deliver three successive Spanish League titles, two European Champions League crowns, two Spanish Cups, two FIFA Club World Cup titles and five further trophies with a soulful swagger that has had many a pundit purring that this is one of the greatest club sides of all time. Guardiola\u2019s masterstroke has been to morph the basics of Barcelona\u2019s philosophy into a new style of soccer that has confronted convention, according to Spanish football expert Sid Lowe. \u201cWhat Guardiola has done to some extent is challenge some of the truisms and clich\u00e9s of football, such as defending is about sitting deep and denying space for teams,\u201d Lowe told CNN. \u201cBarcelona have done the opposite, they\u2019ve gone and looked for teams, defended with possession which teams perhaps haven\u2019t done before. Guardiola \u2013 the greatest soccer artist ever? \u201cThe challenge, for example, on the use of the word practical or pragmatic, to talk about what is essentially a long ball game, but what could be more pragmatic than winning what Barcelona have won in the last four years?\u201d Albert Ferrer played with Guardiola during a golden era for Barcelona, when legendary Dutch coach Johan Cruyff led the club to three consecutive league titles and their first European Cup triumph in the early 1990s. Ferrer believes Guardiola\u2019s innovative, progressive approach to the game was born during that period under Cruyff, himself a staunch defender of Barcelona\u2019s cherished attacking philosophy. \u201cPep tried to play simple football,\u201d said Ferrer of his friend, also Catalan born and bred. \u201cHe created the philosophy where if you can play an easy pass why would you play a difficult one?  \u201cBarcelona are one of the few teams who always had 70-75% possession in games because of the players they had and the philosophy of keeping the ball. He was very demanding of that \u2013 not giving the ball away. \u201cAll the teams now defend against Barcelona and he had to adapt to those solutions. He didn\u2019t always play the same system \u2013 with three defenders or four, playing with a \u20189\u2019 (a traditional striker) or without a \u20189\u2019 \u2013 always making things difficult for the opposition. \u201cAll the movements he created, with the two full backs pushed forward and the center backs very wide, all started with him.\u201d  Michael Cox, from the Zonal Marking website, attributes the development of Guardiola\u2019s coaching philosophy to how the former Barca captain\u2019s own playing career panned out \u2013 where there was a general loss of faith in the deep-lying midfield position Guardiola used to occupy in favor of more aggressive midfielders \u201cHe had to leave Barcelona as a player and take quite a big drop down to Brescia (in Italy) because, frankly, no good club wanted a player in that mold. Everyone wanted big battlers deep in midfield, like Patrick Vieira, Edgar Davids, Roy Keane, Claude Makelele. \u201cNow, he\u2019s managed to construct a team featuring four players who looked up to him when they were in the Barcelona youth team: Sergio Busquets, Xavi, Iniesta, Fabregas.  \u201cI think almost every big club in Europe has copied Barcelona\u2019s way of playing, to a certain extent, in recent years. It\u2019s remarkable that that is now the way to play football, considering his struggles towards the end of his playing career as a deep-lying passer.\u201d As ever in the often fickle world of football, Guardiola has his detractors, who attribute his success as a masterstroke of timing, claiming his tenure conveniently began just as a clutch of great players rolled off the famed Barcelona production line. And while there may be truth in that argument, Lowe believes it was the way Guardiola allied the likes of Xavi, Iniesta, Messi, Busquets and Fabregas to his own football philosophy that was more pertinent. \u201cGuardiola has been the most zealous defender of a certain type of identity \u2013 he hasn\u2019t been the creator of that identity,\u201d said Lowe. \u201cThere\u2019s an almost puritanical conviction about how you\u2019ve got to do things. That mindset has its flaws but Barcelona stick to it. \u201cHe was absolutely the right man at the right time with the right squad, the right players around him. It has been a culmination of circumstance but without that identity it wouldn\u2019t have been as clear or as unshakable.\u201d This unflinching devotion to Barcelona\u2019s cause and the all-consuming nature of the job has taken its toll on Guardiola.  As well as his own meticulous nature combined with the weight of responsibility that comes with being Barca manager, another explosive element \u2013 Real Madrid manager Jose Mourinho \u2013 only added to the pressures on the 41-year-old. \u201cPeople close to him have said they\u2019ve been worried about him for a long time,\u201d said Lowe. \u201cThat he doesn\u2019t eat as well, he looks skinnier, he\u2019s lost his hair.  \u201cGuardiola has struggled to understand the depth of tension that has been created by this rivalry with Mourinho over the last year. I think he has found that genuinely unpleasant at times and hasn\u2019t known how to deal with it. \u201cI think those things have all come together to put us in a position where Guardiola thinks, \u2018I\u2019ve had too much, it just isn\u2019t enjoyable any more.\u2019\u201d In typical Barcelona style, at the press conference to confirm Guardiola\u2019s departure, the club announced his erstwhile assistant Tito Vilanova, another pupil of the club\u2019s famous school, would replace him. Ferrer, who describes his former teammate as a relaxed individual, thinks Guardiola is calling time on his Barcelona tenure at just the right moment. \u201cHe is the manager who has changed everything,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s been clever in choosing the moment to leave because in Barcelona he will always be welcome and he can have whatever position in the club he wants.\u201d Guardiola\u2019s self-enforced break may only be in its embryonic stages but for those fearful he will be lost to football forever, his comments prior to his final match should provide reassurance that he will be back to reinvent the wheel again before too long. \u201cFor the next months I have to charge my batteries and charge my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI am going to rest and I will wait. I will be ready once a club wants me, if they seduce me I will train again.\u201d"

        "content": "Poland may be sitting on a vast natural resource that could make it energy independent.  The Polish government is funding exploratory research into whether or not it should drill for shale gas \u2013 a fossil fuel that some experts believe the country has an abundance of.  Currently coal provides 90% of Poland\u2019s energy making it one of Europe\u2019s most heavily dependent on traditional fossil fuels and the biggest European coal exporter. It has around 17 billion tonnes of coal reserves, according to Euracoal, the European Association for Coal and Lignite, but the country is committed to reducing carbon emission by 20% by 2020. If substantial reserves of natural gas are found buried deep in Poland\u2019s shale rock formations many believe it could also loosen Russia\u2019s grip on Western Europe\u2019s energy market.  \u201cPoland is arguably the biggest focus for shale gas in all of Europe,\u201d says Beata Stelmach, Poland\u2019s Deputy Foreign Minister.  \u201cBut it is not at all clear how many reserves there are\u2026 that won\u2019t be known for another three to five years. There is some worry that early high estimates were widely over enthusiastic.\u201d The Polish government invited big energy companies like Chevron to explore potential gas fields in the southeast of the country. While Chevron has experience developing shale gas in the U.S., Poland is a new frontier where little is known.  \u201cIf you look at the shales in the U.S., they have had hundreds or thousands of penetrations before, really, exploration began. (In Poland) there is just a lot less information,\u201d says John Claussen of Chevron.  What is known is that the method to extract shale gas, hydraulic fracturing or \u201cfracking\u201d, is controversial and can have serious consequence for the environment. The process involves injecting water and chemicals into the shale at extremely high pressure to release the gas. There have been protests in the U.S. against fracking as it is claimed that it can contaminate local water supplies as well to cause wider environmental damage. France and Bulgaria have banned the process because of environmental concerns. \u201cFracking definitely raises certain doubts,\u201d says Przemyslaw Karcz, a geologist with the Polish Geological Survey.   \u201cHowever it is important to remember that in the United States a few thousand sites have already used this fracking system. And that means that the Americans and other exploratory firms have a huge deal of experience when it comes to the extraction of shale gas and fracking. There have maybe been a couple of accidents. Therefore if we look at this the statistics are in favor of exploration.\u201d   Electricity consumption is set to increase by 30% in Poland by 2030, according to Euracoal. If it cannot diversify its energy sources it will have to rely on importing most of its natural gas from neighboring Russia, while still getting the vast majority of its energy from local coal. \u201cWe are not able to say the precise figures (of how much shale gas there is in Poland),\u201d says Stelmach. \u201cIt may change map of the energy of Europe.\u201d"

With little time to prepare for the finals in Ukraine and Poland, Hodgson is looking to quickly stamp his mark on the team and victory was the first priority, their first in Norway since 1966. \u201cIt was a great start for us because we know how difficult it is to win in Norway,\u201d he told ITV Sport. \u201cWe\u2019ve had three tough days in training and everyone\u2019s been so keen to impress me that I think we left a bit on the training pitch,\u201d he added. Former star criticizes Hodgson\u2019s Euro selection  Hodgson gave the captain\u2019s armband to Steven Gerrard and in the early stages of the match the Liverpool man and Scott Parker, returning to action after an Achilles injury, gave England a solid base. Stewart Downing crossed for Andy Carroll to head narrowly wide before England went ahead. Carroll, who started brightly, played the ball forward for the Manchester United star, who deceived Brede Hangeland before scoring with a low shot. It was the fourth goal in four internationals for Young but England were unable to add to their advantage after their promising opening. Norway had plenty of possession and an inswinging corner from Morten Gamst Pedersen struck the post with England goalkeeper  Robert Green out of position. The start of the second half saw Gerrard replaced by Gareth Barry and Theo Walcott came on for Parker after 55 minutes. Barry later limped off with a groin injury which looked a concern and Arsenal teenager Alex Oxlade Chamberlain came on for his first cap. Norway continued to press without creating a clear cut opening to leave Hodgson smiling at the finish. His team have one more friendly against Belgium at Wembley before Euro 2012 where they are paired with France, co-hosts Ukraine and Sweden in their group. They must play their first two games without the suspended Wayne Rooney. "

The third seed successfully defended his title on the French Riviera with a 6-3 6-2 victory in 70 minutes. \u201cI played my best tennis in two years here,\u201d Almagro told the official ATP Tour website.  \u201cI am very happy with my serve and my forehand. I moved on the court very, very well.\u201d Baker has battled back to top form after a succession of injuries and setbacks over the past six years and came into the tournament as world number 216. His heroics in Nice where he beat a string of higher seeded players will see his ranking boosted ahead of the French Open where both he and Almagro are in action later this week. Baker matched Almagro to 3-3 in the opening set but he lost the next three games and the second set also proved testing.  \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I played that poorly. I was a little sore and a little tired, but he was definitely the better player,\u201d he said. Almagro feels the 27-year-old Baker has a big future on the ATP Tour. \u201cHe lost the final today, but he is back, he is playing very good. I think if he plays as he did this week, then he will win many, many tournaments.\u201d In other tennis action Saturday, Serbia won the World Team Cup for the second time as Janko Tipsarevic and Victor Troicki gave them a 3-0  victory over the Czech Republic in the final in Dusseldorf.

The 43-year-old Schumacher brought a five-place grid penalty to Monte Carlo after his collision with Bruno Senna at the Spanish Grand Prix so will have to settle for sixth on the grid. But the form he showed in driving his Mercedes to a time of one minute 14.301 seconds suggested he has lost none of his former pace if supplied with a competitive car. To back that up, his teammate and fellow German Nico Rosberg will start on front row with Red Bull\u2019s Webber after producing the third best lap of the day. But all eyes were on Schumacher, who drove a lap of celebration with one finger in the air in celebration. Bernie: I\u2019ll run F1 until I die  \u201cI\u2019m grateful to all the trust Mercedes had in me and supported me. I\u2019m able to give back a little bit in qualifying and hope I can give more back tomorrow,\u201d he told gathered reporters. Australia\u2019s Webber also produced a brilliant lap to out qualify his teammate, two-time defending champion and championship leader Sebastian Vettel. The German will start from a lowly ninth on the grid.  Webber sportingly accepted that it had been Schumacher who had claimed the spotlight, but he is well placed to repeat his 2010 win in on the classic street circuit. \u201cIt is Michael\u2019s day,\u201d he told the official post-race press conference. \u201cThat was a good lap from him. It was a tight session and lots of different people arrived at the back end of qualifying with different situations with tires. \u201cIt was a pretty good lap and I\u2019m happy with it. It\u2019s a very good position  to be starting tomorrow.\u201d  Pastor Maldonado, who won the Spanish GP for Williams to become the fifth different winner this season in five races, qualified ninth fastest but was relegated 10 places. Stewards took a dim view of the Venezuelan impeding Sergio Perez of Mexico during an earlier practice session Saturday. Britain\u2019s Lewis Hamilton will go from third place on the grid but his McLaren teammate Jenson Button was only 12th best. Frenchman Romain Grosjean of Lotus will start fourth ahead of the two Ferraris of two-time champion Spaniard Fernando Alonso and Brazilian Felipe Massa.

Webber made the most of starting from pole position to hold off Nico Rosberg in the Mercedes with Fernando Alonso taking third for Ferrari to take over at the top of the world title standings. Webber\u2019s Red Bull teammate and two-time defending champion Sebastian Vettel finished a fine fourth after starting ninth on the grid. Both Alonso and Vettel moved ahead of a disappointed Lewis Hamilton during their pit stops, leaving the McLaren driver in fifth spot. Felipe Massa was sixth in the second Ferrari. Briton Paul di Resta drove a fine race to finish seventh, just ahead of his Force India teammate  German Nico Hulkenberg.  Finn Kimi Raikkonen of Lotus and Brazilian Bruno Senna in his Williams completed the points scoring.   It was the third straight Monaco win for Red Bull, who extended their lead in the constructors\u2019 standings over McLaren. Webber, who also won in 2010, was claiming his eighth Formula One career victory and he moved level with Vettel into joint second in the standings, three points adrift of Alonso. \u201cI feel incredible,\u201d Webber told the official post-race press conference. \u201cIt was a very interesting race, reasonably straightforward at the start, just managing the gap to Nico (Rosberg). \u201cI\u2019m really glad to have won here again, a great victory for me.\u201d It was another disappointing race day for seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, who had been the fastest in qualifying. A five-place grid penalty left the Mercedes driver starting from sixth and an early tangle with Romain Grosjean (Lotus), who was forced to retire, saw him slip back to eighth. A technical problem later hit Schumacher to leave him pointless again. The race was held against the backdrop of the constant threat of a rain shower, which could have seen a complete change in the finishing order. The rain eventually came with a vengeance after the finish, leaving Webber to breath a sigh of relief. Alonso was also a big winner on the day, with Ferrari making great strides after being off the pace earlier in the season. \u201cFor me, the target was to try to finish in front of Sebastian and Lewis (Hamilton) as they are with us in the championship. If you go race by race, you  aim to finish ahead of different drivers.     \u201cNow it is Mark (Webber).  It will be interesting, as we are constantly developing  the car and we are constantly surprised at every race.\u201d The seventh round of the championship takes place in Canada in two weeks time.  "

        "content": "A furious Ernie Els blasted Wentworth officials over the condition of the course he redesigned after completing his third round at the PGA Championship Saturday. The popular South African moved into a tie for fourth behind leader Luke Donald after a solid two-under 70 in blustery conditions on the West Course. But rather than talk about his admittedly slim chances of victory, Els only wanted to bemoan the state of most of the greens, which he described as \u201cvirtually unplayable,\u201d due to a lack of watering. He told the official European Tour website: \u201cIt\u2019s such a pity as so much work and effort has been put in. \u201cI wish the Tour and the green staff would put more moisture in, I have asked them, begged them to do it but obviously they see it differently. \u201cIt\u2019s a never-ending story around here,\u201d he complained. Els, who owns a property near the course, was commissioned by Wentworth owner Richard Caring to make radical changes back in 2010 and not all have been greeted with acclaim by leading players, particularly those to the par-five 18th. The 42-year-old, who won the World Match Play tournament seven times at Wentworth, had to use all his expertise and local knowledge to move up the leaderboard. Els was one of only 10 players to be under par, with Donald, set to reclaim the world number one spot, finishing with a birdie on the final hole for a joint best of the day three-under 69 for 11-under 205.   Fellow Englishman Justin Rose also shot a 69 to trail by two shots going into the final round where he will be paired with Donald. The defending championship needs to finish in the top eight to leapfrog Rory McIlroy, who missed the cut at the European Tour\u2019s flagship event. Donald first attained the ranking thanks to his 2011 victory and despite losing the No.1 spot since has shown incredible consistency. \u201cIt will be a proud moment personally to go a whole year and still be at the top of the world rankings,\u201d he told BBC Sport. \u201cBut obviously my main focus is to try to win the tournament.\u201d Ireland\u2019s Peter Lawrie challenged him at the top of the leaderboard until dropping shots on the back nine to be third on seven-under. Els, fellow South Africans Richard Sterne and Branden Grace and former British Open champion Paul Lawrie shared fourth, but six shots behind Donald. Overnight leader James Morrison of England slumped to an 81 to go back to three-under.       "

        "content": "Germany\u2019s build-up to Euro 2012 suffered a setback Saturday with a 5-3 defeat to Switzerland in Basel. It was the first time the Swiss, who did not qualify for this summer\u2019s tournament, had beaten Germany in an international since 1956. German coach Joachim Loew fielded an understrength team as he rested eight Bayern Munich players who were involved in the Champions League final defeat to Chelsea last weekend. But the performance of their understudies will do little to inspire confidence, with goalkeeper Ter Stegen having a forgettable error-strewn match as the Germans lost for the second time in a row. Having gone through Euro qualifying unbeaten, they were beaten by France 2-1 in their last friendly in February. Swiss striker Eren Derdiyok, who plays in the Bundesliga, scored a hat-trick and put his team 2-0 ahead with two first half goals in three minutes.  Both goals were laid on by strike partner Tranquillo Barnettas before defender Mats Hummels pulled one back for Germany just before halftime with a header from a Mesut Ozil cross. But Derdiyok made it 3-1 after 50 minutes, again from a Barnettas assist. Andre Schuerrle cut the lead to give Germany some hope before Andre Lichtsteiner made it 4-2 in the 67th minute. Marco Reus added the third for the Germans five minutes later but Admir Mehmedi sealed victory for the Swiss and made it 5-3 late on. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect a result like this and we cannot be satisfied by it,\u201d  Loew told AFP. Meanwhile, Spain warmed up for a  defense of their European title with a 2-0 friendly win over Serbia in a friendly played in Switzerland. Coach Vicente del Bosque was also forced to field a second string line-up with many of his players involved in Friday\u2019s Copa del Rey final between Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao. Atletico Madrid\u2019s Adrian Lopez, a second half substitute, headed the 2010 World Cup winners in front  in the 64th minute. He was then pulled down by Serbia captain Branislav Ivanovic to earn a 75th minute penalty, converted by Santi Cazorla. Spain announce their 23-man squad for Poland and the Ukraine Sunday. Portugal, captained by Cristiano Ronaldo, were held to a disappointing 0-0 draw by Macedonia in Leiria. Their group rivals in the Euro finals, Denmark,  were beaten 3-1 by a young Brazil side, who are preparing for the London Olympics, in a friendly in Hamburg. Porto striker Hulk scored twice with Denmark\u2019s Niki Zimling turning an Oscar cross into his own net for the other goal. Nicklas Bendtner pulled a goal back for the well-beaten Danes. The Netherlands also went down to a friendly defeat, losing 2-1 at home to Bulgaria. Arsenal\u2019s Robin van Persie gave the Dutch a 45th minute lead but Bulgaria, who did not make Euro 2012, equalized four minutes into the second half with an Ivelin Popov penalty after Rafael van der Vaart had hand balled. Bulgaria striker Ilijan Mizanski grabbed a shock winner in the second minute of injury time as the home side pushed forward and were caught on the break.  "

        "content": "Pope Benedict\u2019s butler has been arrested on suspicion of leaking confidential documents to an Italian journalist, the Vatican said Saturday. Paolo Gabriele, 46, was arrested Wednesday for illegal possession of confidential documents, found in his apartment in Vatican territory, the Vatican said in a statement issued three days later.  Gabriele, who has worked as the papal butler since 2006, is one of only a handful of people with access to the pontiff\u2019s private desk. His job included handing out rosaries to dignitaries and riding in the front seat of the \u201cPopemobile,\u201d a vehicle used for public papal appearances, as seen in many photographs showing Gabriele with the pope. Last month, the Vatican gave Cardinal Julian Herranz a \u201cpontifical mandate\u201d to uncover the source of hundreds of personal letters and confidential documents that have been released to Gianluigi Nuzzi, an Italian journalist and author of \u201cSua Santita,\u201d a book that translates to \u201cHis Holiness\u201d and includes the documents.  Nuzzi would not confirm the identity of his sources, but he told CNN that his primary source \u2013 who he referred to as \u201cMaria\u201d in his book \u2013 \u201crisked life and limb\u201d if ever found out.  The source worked inside the Vatican, according to Nuzzi, who refused to give other details such as the source\u2019s gender, age and if he or she was clergy or not. Nuzzi told CNN that he has not been questioned in connection with the arrest. The Vatican called the publication of his book \u201ccriminal\u201d when it was released last Saturday in Italian. Feltrenelli and Mondadori booksellers both rank the book No. 1 in sales within Italy. Nuzzi\u2019s book highlights an internal power struggle within the Vatican through numerous documents including faxes, personal letters and inter-Vatican memos. He told CNN that he received the documents during a year of private meetings in secret locations.  The documents show that the allegations of corruption and money laundering were a concern for a number of high ranking prelates, including Carlo Maria Vigano, who is now the Papal Nuncio in Washington, DC.  Vigano wrote in a series of letters to the pope that he was concerned about the spread of corruption and that his move to Washington would stir speculation.   \u201cHoly Father, my transfer at this time would provoke much disorientation and discouragement in those who have believed it was possible to clean up so many situations of corruption and abuse of power that have been rooted in the management of so many departments,\u201d according to his letter which was published in the book.  The Vatican has not denied the authenticity of the documents, but instead says the breach of privacy is a criminal act.  The 108-acre city-state has its own judicial system, distinct from the Italian judicial system. CNN senior Vatican analyst John Allen pointed out that its courts normally prosecute the likes of pickpockets, \u201cnot alleged moles.\u201d Thus, the Vatican doesn\u2019t have facilities to incarcerate anyone on a long-term basis and the civil and criminal penalties it typically metes out are limited, Allen said Saturday. He speculated that, for these and other reasons, the Vatican may ask \u2013 assuming that it determines there is enough evidence against Gabriele \u2013 that any such trial occur within the Italian judicial system. \u201cThe question then would become: Does the Italian government want to pick that (trial) up?\u201d said Allen, a senior correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter. \u201cIn addition to being an embarrassing scandal for the Vatican on its own terms, this also has the potential to become \u2026 a diplomatic contretemps.\u201d For now, Gabriele is being held in a special cell within the Vatican City, a walled enclave within Rome, according to Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi.  Lombardi said the pope was \u201csaddened and shocked\u201d at the arrest. The Vatican said the first phase of its preliminary investigation, under chief prosecutor Nicola Picardi, had now ended.  An investigating judge, Piero Antonio Bonnet, is leading the next stage of the investigation, which could lead to a trial or acquittal. Gabriele has appointed two lawyers of his choice to act at the Vatican Tribunal, and has had a chance to meet them, the Vatican statement said.  \u201cHe enjoys all the legal guarantees provided by the criminal code and criminal procedure in force in the State of Vatican City,\u201d it added."

        "content": "Barcelona marked Pep Guardiola\u2019s final match in charge with a 3-0 win over  Athletic Bilbao to win the Copa del Rey Friday. It was the 14th trophy of Guardiola\u2019s remarkable reign at the Catalan giants which began at the start of the 2008/09 season when he succeeded Frank Rijkaard. To honor their departing coach, Barcelona turned on the style in the Vicente Calderon Stadium in Madrid and the match was effectively over inside the first 25 minutes as Pedro Rodriguez with a double and Lionel Messi scored to put them 3-0 ahead. The emphatic victory will be consolation in part for shattering defeats to eventual winners Chelsea in the semifinal of the Champions League and the concession of their La Liga title to arch-rivals Real Madrid. After the Chelsea reverse, the 41-year-old Guardiola announced he would be leaving at the end of the season, bringing to a close a 23-year association with the club as a player and coach. Guardiola cited tiredness and the need to take a break as reasons for his departure, but he has been linked with a number of vacant managerial vacancies, including Chelsea.  His assistant Tito Vilanova will take charge of Barcelona next season. They shared the dugout for the final time as Barcelona rounded off their season and afterwards Guardiola said he left with a special sense of accomplishment.  \u201cFourteen titles in four years is a very high standard so I am very happy to  leave the club in a good position, and tonight we played great for the first 35 minutes, we\u2019ve had a good year with four titles so I leave very satisfied,\u201d he told gathered reporters. \u201cFrom (Lionel) Messi I have learned to be even more competitive than I ever was, without him we would not have won the number of titles we have and I\u2019m very privileged to have coached who for me is the best player I have ever seen.\u201d Barca\u2019s 2011/12 campaign had begun in the usual all-conquering fashion for Guardiola and his men as they collected the Spanish Super Cup, beating Real Madrid, the European Super Cup and their second Club World Cup. But Real took advantage of rare slips by the three-time reigning champions to forge clear in La Liga, the title sealed by a 2-1 win at the Nou Camp last month. A 2-2 home draw to Chelsea, losing 3-2 on aggregate, prompted Guardiola\u2019s shock departure and left the Copa del Rey as their only remaining target. Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s Bilbao were expected to offer stiffer resistance but defeat to Atletico Madrid in the Europa League final and disappointing late season form in La Liga was reflected in their performance. Pedro, who has endured a mediocre season, thumped home the first after three minutes and Messi made it 2-0 with his 73rd goal of the season for Barcelona soon afterwards. Pedro\u2019s low strike on 25 minutes settled all doubt about the eventual outcome although Fernando Llorente looked to have a strong penalty claim when pulled down by Gerard Pique. Bilbao had the better chances after the break but Barcelona\u2019s stars coasted to their third victory in Spain\u2019s domestic cup competition in four years to provide a fitting finale for Guardiola. Editors note: Read Chris Murphy\u2019s feature on CNN World Sport Monday that asks: Did Pep Guardiola reinvent football in his time at Barcelona?   "

An inspired Federer ended Djokovic\u2019s unbeaten streak and dashed the Serbian\u2019s chances of the grand slam before losing in the final to Rafael Nadal. Friday\u2019s draw for the second grand slam of the season saw Nadal in the same half of the draw as fourth seed Andy Murray of Britain, again setting up the chance of a re-run of 2011. Spain\u2019s Nadal will be bidding for a record seventh French Open title this year and opens against  Simone Bolelli while Djokovic also faces Italian opposition in Potito Starace. Federer must get past Germany\u2019s Tobias Kamke to earn a potentially tricky second round clash with Argentina\u2019s David Nalbandian.  Big-hitters Juan Martin Del Potro of Argentina or Czech Tomas Berdych could also provide Federer with tough obstacles in his section of the draw. Murray, out of sorts and struggling with injury is drawn to face home hope Richard Gasquet of France, who beat him at last week\u2019s Italian Open. The women\u2019s draw has pitted second seed Maria Sharapova and old rival Serena Williams in the same quarter and a possible quarterfinal clash. Sharapova, yet to win the French Open, warmed up by taking the Italian Open crown, while Williams has claimed titles in Charleston and Madrid on the clay. But 2002 winner Williams has a tough draw and is seeded to meet Dane Caroline Wozniacki in the last 16. Defending champion Li Na of China, beaten by Sharapova in the Rome final last weekend,  faces  Romanian Sorana Cirstea in the first round and could meet 2011 Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova in the quarters. But Kvitova will probably have to get past 2010 winner and last year\u2019s runner-up Francesca Schiavone to progress that far. Top seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus has been paired with Italian Alberta Brianti in the first round as she looks to secure her second consecutive grand slam after her Australian triumph. World No.3 Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland is drawn to face Venus Williams in the second round. The action starts Sunday in the French capital. "

Her appointment comes as FIFA embarks on a reform program in the wake of recent corruption scandals.  A campaigner for women\u2019s rights, Nsekera is keen to be a role model for others to follow. \u201cWomen have to understand that they have a role to play off the pitch, that they can easily take on responsibilities and become leaders.

The decision comes just under a year after it declared independence and joined the United Nations. South Sudan and Sudan have been involved in a lengthy conflict, but peace talks between the two nations are due to resume next week. But FIFA delayed a decision on whether to permit non-FIFA member Kosovo to play friendly matches against member federations. FIFA\u2019s executive committee had given Kosovo the go-ahead earlier this week, but Serbia launched a protest at the move. Kosovo is a former Serb province and that fought a two-year battle for independence. It is still not recognized by Serbia.   "

McIlroy had cut a frustrated and angry figure during an opening 74, but after a solid start to his second round he dropped a string of shots on the back nine. It opens the door for England\u2019s Luke Donald, who needs to finish in the top-eight in the Tour\u2019s flagship event to reclaim top spot. Donald, who is the defending champion, carded a second straight 68 to share second place on eight-under-par with Scot David Drysdale. They both trail runaway leader James Morrison who carded a superb eight-under 64 in calmer morning conditions to lead at halfway on 12-under 132. McIlroy faced an uphill battle to make the cut, but had recovered to stand one-under for the day through the seventh. But a double bogey on the eighth started the rot and he proceeded to card five straight bogeys and another double bogey on the 15th. For the 23-year-old, who also missed the cut at the Players Championship on the PGA Tour, it is hardly ideal preparation for his defense of the U.S. Open title next month. \u201cIt\u2019s been a week I\u2019d like to forget. It\u2019s not nice to play like this and not nice two weeks in a row. Maybe it\u2019s a good thing I have two days off to practice and I\u2019m looking to getting back to the States next week,\u201d he told gathered reporters. Donald, who can benefit the most from McIlroy\u2019s implosion, insisted that repeating his 2011 success on the Surrey course was his first priority. \u201cTo be honest, the focus is always to try and win the tournament,\u201d he told the official European Tour website. Morrison, who lives nearby, is looking to add to his 2010 Madeira Open success and finished in fine style with an eagle. A fine all-round sportsman, he played in the England under-17 cricket team with current Test players Alastair Cook and Tim Bresnan, but has never regretted turning to golf full time. \u201cPlaying golf is better than standing in the field all day,\u201d he jokingly told reporters. Peter Lawrie of Ireland and Spain\u2019s Alvaro Quiros shared fourth spot on seven-under.  World No.3 Lee Westwood was among a number of star players to struggle in blustery afternoon conditions and was right on the cut line at one-over 145.  "

        "content": "A campaign to win Scotland\u2019s independence from the United Kingdom was launched Friday in Edinburgh, Scotland. The \u201cYes Scotland\u201d campaign wants to \u201cbuild a groundswell of support for an independent Scotland\u201d ahead of a referendum on the issue in 2014. Its organizers have urged people to put their name to a \u201cYes Declaration\u201d posted on the campaign website. The text reads: \u201cI believe that it is fundamentally better for us all, if decisions about Scotland\u2019s future are taken by the people who care most about Scotland, that is, by the people of Scotland. \u201cBeing independent means Scotland\u2019s future will be in Scotland\u2019s hands. \u201cThere is no doubt that Scotland has great potential. We are blessed with talent, resources and creativity. We have the opportunity to make our nation a better place to live, for this and future generations. We can build a greener, fairer and more prosperous society that is stronger and more successful than it is today. \u201cI want a Scotland that speaks with her own voice and makes her own unique contribution to the world: a Scotland that stands alongside the other nations on these isles, as an independent nation.\u201d Others want Scotland to maintain its historic presence in the United Kingdom. Prime Minister David Cameron traveled to Scotland in February to make the case for keeping the United Kingdom together. He said then: \u201cThe fight is now under way for something really precious: the future of our United Kingdom. I am 100% clear that I will fight with everything I have to keep our United Kingdom together. To me, this is not some issue of policy or strategy or calculation \u2013 it matters head, heart and soul.\u201d A key argument for keeping the United Kingdom together is that it is stronger and has more clout as a single entity, he said. \u201cInside the United Kingdom, Scotland \u2013 just as much as England, Wales and Northern Ireland \u2013 is stronger, safer, richer and fairer,\u201d Cameron said. However, the campaign for independence is backed by the Scottish National Party (SNP), which says it will make the country fairer and more prosperous. \u201cThese are exciting times for Scotland as we work to build a better nation. The Yes Scotland campaign will be about the people of Scotland, and how being independent can make life better for families and individuals across our country, \u201d said SNP Campaigns Director Angus Robertson ahead of its launch. A poll conducted by the YouGov website in January found that Scots are in favor of granting the Scottish government more responsibility and power, but most do not want total independence from the rest of the United Kingdom. The wording of the referendum has not yet been decided.  The UK Parliament\u2019s Scottish Affairs Committee said in an interim report this month that based on the evidence it had received, it had \u201cno choice but to conclude that the question currently proposed by the Scottish Government is biased.\u201d Scotland\u2019s devolved government is responsible for many issues of day-to-day concern to the people of Scotland, including health, education, justice and transport, but other matters are decided by the UK Parliament.

        "content": "After more than half a century involved in motorsport, and three decades at the helm of Formula One, Bernie Ecclestone has no plans to quit just yet. In fact, the 81-year-old has told CNN that he will be in charge for as long as he lives.  \u201cIt\u2019ll probably depend a lot (on) when I die,\u201d Ecclestone said ahead of this weekend\u2019s Monaco Grand Prix when asked about his retirement plans. \u201cYou never know, do you, with these things. I mean, it\u2019s not my intention to do such a thing. If I thought I couldn\u2019t do all the things I do, then the answer would be then we\u2019d certainly consider it. At the moment it\u2019s not quite like that.\u201d Ecclestone: Formula One teams agree to race until 2020 Despite his age,  Ecclestone is keeping himself very busy \u2013 both personally and professionally. Earlier this month he announced his engagement to Brazilian Fabiani Flosi, 46 years his junior. He has also set his sights on further extending Formula One\u2019s global reach, having announced an agreement with the teams to continue racing under a Concorde Agreement until 2020. Austin, Texas will make its debut as grand prix venue in November, as the sport returns to the U.S. for the first time since 2007. India was introduced to F1 last year, with the Russian city of Sochi set to host a race in 2014 \u2013 the same year the Black Sea resort will stage the Winter Olympics. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have an American base,\u201d Ecclestone said. \u201cWe are a world championship, so why not? We have races in other parts of the world so we should have maybe another race in America.\u201d On the possibility of France hosting a race for the first time since 2008, he added: \u201cI think maybe the election that has taken place might have put that back a bit. When that all settles down I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get back on track \u2013 literally,\u201d referring to Francois Hollande\u2019s recent presidential victory. \u201cI think you will have to wait and see if we see more. Only time will tell.\u201d Should Formula One be so unpredictable? Ecclestone has been criticized for his determination to go ahead with the recent Bahrain Grand Prix, despite political unrest in the Gulf kingdom. But Eccleston cited the riots in London as an example of how social unrest does not necessarily mean a country should forfeit its right to host a race. \u201cI\u2019d hate to lose the British race, for a start,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen what happened there at the end of last year, all those disturbances and all the other things that happen all over the world.  \u201cI don\u2019t know where we\u2019d have to find a nice place to race where there is no problem. It wouldn\u2019t be easy.\u201d One arena F1 has not managed to enter is the Olympic Games, but Ecclestone revealed that talks over the seemingly far-fetched possibility have been held. \u201cI spoke to the former president, Mr. (Juan Antonio) Samaranch, years ago about this and we decided it was wrong to have mechanical sport involved. In fact I discussed it with the new president (Jacques Rogge) a year ago. \u201cThey keep adding things in which I don\u2019t believe are Olympic things, so maybe it\u2019s possible. It would be nice to see it happen.\u201d The current F1 season\u2019s first five races have produced five different winners for the first time since 1983. A major factor in the sport\u2019s current unpredictability has been the new Pirelli tires \u2013 the team which masters the rapidly degrading rubber usually emerges victorious. Seven-time world champion and Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher has been heavily critical of the tires, telling CNN they are like driving on \u201craw eggs,\u201d but Ecclestone praised the work done by the Italian manufacturer. \u201cI asked Pirelli if they could make a tire that would only run for a third of the race, which is a lot more difficult than making a tire that will run the whole race. That\u2019s easily done; it can run five races if you like.  \u201cBut to make one that will only run that distance is difficult. They\u2019ve done a fantastic job and that\u2019s what has made this racing so exciting.\u201d When reflecting on his contribution to F1, Ecclestone was relaxed when asked if he has received enough credit for what he has given to the sport, responding: \u201cI get what I deserve, I suppose.\u201d And what is it that keeps the Englishman going after so long at the forefront of an ever-expanding business? \u201cJob satisfaction.\u201d"

        "content": "You don\u2019t get any prizes for guessing that Maria Sharapova is the highest-earning female athlete in the world. But who is the second richest? Is it Serena Williams, the American 13-time grand slam winner? Or is it Victoria Azarenka, the world No. 1 and winner of 35 of her 38 matches this year? And away from tennis, there is Danica Patrick, the only woman to win an IndyCar race and a big drawcard for motorsport sponsors. In fact, it is Li Na, the world No. 7 women\u2019s tennis player and winner of a single grand slam title in a 13-year career. But that surprise victory at the French Open almost a year ago transformed Li into one of the world\u2019s most marketable athletes. According to Forbes.com, she earned $18 million to April 2012 (up $10 million from 2011) \u2013 $8 million shy of Sharapova\u2019s total but $5 million more than third-placed Williams. So why are brands scrambling to associate with Li, who will defend her title at Roland Garros when the clay-court major starts on Sunday. \u201cTwo words: She\u2019s Chinese,\u201d says Simon Chadwick, Professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at Coventry University Business School in Britain. \u201cLi Na is out there on her own, firstly in terms of being a female Chinese sportsperson and secondly in terms of her international profile and success.\u201d The fact that Li plays tennis \u2013 a traditionally middle-class sport \u2013 is also in her favor. \u201cChina has now become the biggest market for luxury brands in the world and there is this kind of convergence between luxury brands and tennis,\u201d Chadwick told CNN. \u201cThe kind of people who are interested in those brands are also interested in tennis, so Li Na is a very convenient way of aligning the two.\u201d Li\u2019s agent Max Eisenbud, who also represents Sharapova, spotted the potential in 2009 when he signed her to IMG\u2019s books. He concedes that although he thought she had top-five potential, he didn\u2019t necessarily expect her to be a grand slam winner. But at age 29, and in her 20th major tournament, Li beat Francesca Schiavone to become the first Chinese player to win a grand slam singles title and set off a chain of events that had Eisenbud working overnight from a makeshift office to stay in touch with his colleagues in Beijing while the offers flooded in. \u201cShe\u2019s basically the Billie Jean King of China,\u201d Eisenbud told CNN. \u201cShe broke down so many barriers. \u201cShe was the first \u2013 and it\u2019s weird that you can say that in 2012 \u2013 that there\u2019s somewhere in the world that they just don\u2019t have a rich tradition of sports heroes. \u201cI think that was very cool to see: that the win was a lot bigger than tennis.\u201d Li has signed seven new sponsorship deals since her Roland Garros triumph. Among them are luxury car maker Mercedes Benz and Chinese insurance company Taikang Life Insurance Co. Eisenbud even managed to negotiate a special deal with Nike to allow Li to wear patches on her clothing \u2013 something not usually permitted by the American sportswear giant. \u201cI think we did a good job on a hybrid of global brands that could potentially use Li Na to help get a footing in China and then we also wanted to associate with some great Chinese brands,\u201d he said. Eisenbud estimates they could have signed up to seven more deals, but with his experience of managing Sharapova\u2019s money-making potential after her 2004 Wimbledon win, he was wary of compromising Li\u2019s tennis career. Li won only six more matches in 2011 after the French Open final, going out in the second round at Wimbledon and the first hurdle at the U.S. Open. She has been more like her old self in 2012, reaching two finals, most recently at the Italian Open where she lost out to Sharapova over three sets. \u201cI liked the way I hit on court,\u201d she said afterwards. \u201cA lot of positive things and I think I am ready for the French Open.\u201d The reality is that financially at least, it really doesn\u2019t matter how Li performs at Roland Garros this time around. She was already nearing the end of her career when she won the title and the deals were negotiated with that in mind. What IMG and Li\u2019s team has done is what Chadwick calls \u201cshort-term harvesting.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s to make as much money as possible in the period of time they\u2019ve got left before she retires,\u201d said the academic. \u201cThe French Open was all she needed because we\u2019re still talking about it now, that\u2019s proof that\u2019s all she needed.\u201d Which begs the question: would any Chinese player have had the same earning potential as Li had they become the first major winner from the world\u2019s most populous country? Maybe not. Chadwick says Li\u2019s added value comes from the fact that she rejected the Chinese state-run sports system, while Eisenbud describes as her \u201clittle bit of rebel.\u201d That little bit of rebelliousness is most visible in the red rose tattoo she sports on her chest. \u201cIn Western terms, marketers talk about brand personality,\u201d Chadwick said. \u201cAnd she does have some personality to her, the whole thing about her tattoo, the crazy things she says about her husband (who Li has publicly berated for his snoring).\u201d \u201cEffectively what Li Na does is give these Western brands a direct route into the Chinese marketplace, which is a notoriously difficult and complex country to do business in.\u201d Li joked in August last year that she still used her husband Jian Shang\u2019s credit card when she went shopping because she liked to save money. If Jian ever needs a loan to pay off the bill, he need look no further than his multimillionaire wife."

        "content": "Here\u2019s a quick way to get arrested in modern Russia: Walk into a cathedral wearing a neon mask and carrying a guitar, stand on the pulpit and scream punk songs with lyrics like \u201cVirgin Mary drive Putin away!\u201d Throw in a few more obscenities, and that\u2019s how three members of the punk band Pussy Riot ended up in Russian prison in early March, after criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin, who the group says is in bed with the Russian Orthodox Church and is unfairly cracking down on free speech. Three of its members are still in prison and have been charged with \u201chooliganism,\u201d a crime that carries a maximum sentence of seven years, according to news reports. Before that, the all-female, anonymous band had performed on top of a prison and on Red Square in Moscow, the capital. Their performances on YouTube attract hundreds of thousands of views. After the arrest, punk rockers in cities as far away as San Francisco put on public performances in solidarity with the group. Pussy Riot, in its own controversial way, has become a symbol of the protest movement in Russia. \u201cEveryone loves the Sex Pistols, and no one likes punk bands being arrested for singing,\u201d said Pyotr Verzilov, a collaborator with the band who talked with CNN at a recent human rights conference in Norway, where he was speaking on Pussy Riot\u2019s behalf. The band has drawn comparisons to other Western punk bands, including the Ramones. \u201cUnlike their British and American forerunners, however,\u201d writes Bloomberg Businessweek, \u201cthe Russian rockers have something very real to be angry about, starting with their own imprisonment.\u201d Some say Putin is cracking down unfairly on the band at a time when protesters continue to gather in the capital; others that Pussy Riot defiled the church and should be punished. Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, called their cathedral performance blasphemy, according to RIA Novosti, the state-owned news agency. A priest, writing in Russia Today, said that \u201cto try to label such a performance in a church as a political protest doesn\u2019t make it any more acceptable.\u201d Their detention has been extended by a Moscow court until June 24, according to that government-funded news organization. For Verzilov, a 26-year-old who also is married to one of the arrested band members, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 23, the ordeal is, of course, both political and personal. He had to figure out a way to tell their 4-year-old daughter why her mom is in prison. Verzilov spoke with CNN about the personal challenges of being involved in politics in modern Russia, and about how his wife\u2019s punk band came into existence.  The following is an edited transcript:  CNN: Tell me about the idea behind the band. Verzilov: Pussy Riot is this punk feminist band, which was formed by a collective of women who decided the best way to bring (forward) both political and feminist ideas in the context of present-day Putinist Russia was to do these unsanctioned punk performances with their faces covered. And at the same time bring on a very bright image, but avoid objectification of girls who take part in these events. CNN: Describe what they look like when they perform. Verzilov: Usually their performance looks like an unsanctioned sudden musical event. In a very strange place (that\u2019s) not suited for a musical performance. They performed on top of a Moscow detention center. This is a prison where people were being arrested after the parliamentary elections were being held \u2026 including myself. They sometimes do these landmark performances in very heavily guarded spots, like the Red Square. After, they were detained by the federal security service of Russia. They did have time to play the song. The four minutes they needed to play the song. And, obviously, their last and most famous performance was at the Christ the Savior Cathedral. A week later, three members got a criminal arrest. CNN: What were they singing exactly that got them in trouble? Or was it where they were singing? Verzilov: It\u2019s a very different thing what they were actually singing inside the cathedral and what got put into the video on the Internet.  What actually happened in the cathedral is five girls in dresses came into the cathedral, very modest looking. At some point they put on the masks. They go on to the pulpit and take out a guitar and start just singing a song, which was dedicated to bashing the close relationship of the church and the state in Russia.  Officially it\u2019s supposed to be separated by the constitution, but in recent months the Russian Orthodox Church has become like a supportive propaganda machine for the Kremlin. The patriarch, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, he is a man who enjoys the development of a very close political relationship with Putin. The text of the song was pointing out that Patriarchate doesn\u2019t believe in God but he believes in Putin. CNN: Can you give me some of the lyrics?  Verzilov: The chorus is, \u201cVirgin Mother Mary please drive Putin away. Drive Putin away.\u201d CNN: Do you think that line is what got them arrested? Verzilov: It\u2019s not this line. It\u2019s the whole image of Pussy Riot doing very bright political performances and the Russian media and the foreign media going just, \u201cwow,\u201d and pointing so much attention at them. (That) is what really got into the heads of people close to Putin. They decided it was a good time to arrest these girls. It caused a huge scandal. CNN: How long have they been in jail and what have they been charged with? Verzilov: They have been arrested on March the 3, so it\u2019s been more than two months. They\u2019ve been charged with Article 213 of the Russian criminal code: hooliganism.  The absolutely absurd thing in the Russian government is that you have the minister of justice in Russia saying he doubts the legality of the girls being arrested. He doubts this is the appropriate way for this case to be handled. It was very big in the news.  You have the person who is in change of the legal system for the country saying this is not legal, and the girls are still there. CNN: Your wife was one of those arrested? Verzilov: Yes. CNN: This may sound like a na\u00efve question, but how have you dealt with that? Verzilov: Another thing \u2013 a very funny thing. When a man or a relative gets arrested, a husband or wife usually gets a chance to see him \u2013 at least once in two weeks.  But in this case, the head of the Moscow police \u2026 saw me giving some very harsh comments on television and he said this guy is not going to see his wife, because he\u2019s mentioned Putin in interviews. CNN: So you haven\u2019t seen her at all? Verzilov: No. I was denied to see Nadezhda. Basically the only people who see the girls are their lawyers. Of course it\u2019s been hard because, well, we have a daughter. And someone has to run the family. Nadezhda and I, we\u2019re very close, also professionally, right? In some marriages, you have the husband running his own life and the wife running her own life. We\u2019re very close in what we do, and we\u2019re basically best friends. We\u2019re very close. CNN: How old is your daughter and what have you told her about this? Verzilov: She\u2019s 4 years old. Things that are happening in Russia with the girls \u2026 in a way, they\u2019re very fairy-tale-like. There\u2019s a bad guy sitting and deciding who should go to prison, who shouldn\u2019t and how the criminal case should go. We don\u2019t have an independent court, independent prosecution, independent police system. It\u2019s just one bad guy deciding how everybody should function. This is very much like a fairy-tale story that kids see in cartoons or in fairy-tales that are read to them. In this case it\u2019s very easy to explain. When people ask she says, \u201cYeah, Putin sent my mother to prison.\u201d CNN: Wow, so she understands what\u2019s happening? Verzilov: Yes, she sees it. This case has gotten so much publicity because it is so black and white. No one has any doubts what\u2019s going on with them. CNN: Is your daughter angry? Verzilov: Well, she doesn\u2019t understand you can\u2019t defeat the bad guy immediately and release Nadezhda, you know. She has this fairy-tale outlook. CNN: What are you trying to do to get your wife out of prison? Do you have any recourse? Verzilov: The main plan is to put Putin in a position where it\u2019s too expensive to hold the girls anymore. It\u2019s already like the most publicized and the biggest criminal case in Russia. We have hopes the new French president, (Francois) Hollande, will personally tell Putin he doesn\u2019t know why they\u2019re doing this to Pussy Riot. We had the president of Estonia speak out. Out of leaders of countries, he\u2019s so far the only one, but a lot of other high-level diplomats have spoken on the case.  CNN: If they were convicted, what sort of sentence would they face? Verzilov: Under this article, they can be charged with up to seven years in prison. It\u2019s from two to seven. There\u2019s also a fine that\u2019s possible under this article, but, of course, it\u2019s completely unknown what\u2019s going to happen to them. The investigator, the person who leads this case, doesn\u2019t really try to hide that it\u2019s a political case. CNN: Are you speaking here in Oslo trying to raise awareness? Verzilov: We\u2019re doing a big, public campaign in Russia. Mostly people have been trying to organize on their own. So there have been 20 or 30 big actions in support of Pussy Riot, around the world. I know of at least five in the States. \u2026 Everyone loves the Sex Pistols, and no one likes punk bands being arrested for singing. CNN: Give me the context for how all this began?  Verzilov: Pussy Riot is kind of this anonymous, closed secret project. The point of Pussy Riot is that it doesn\u2019t really matter who\u2019s behind the mask. Anyone can put on a mask and do songs, basically. It\u2019s like the Guy Fawkes mask. You had people in the UK saying the Guy Fawkes mask is last year\u2019s fashion \u2013 now you have to wear the Pussy Riot mask. So, in this sense, it\u2019s a very good analogy. CNN: They were performing in these places that were difficult to get to \u2013 on top of a prison or in Red Square. How did you set that up, logistically? Verzilov: Logistically it\u2019s not really difficult if you want to get on top of a prison. It was a building standing on the corner of the prison territory, so they just got up a big ladder and had people to help them. They climbed up on top of the roof and they performed and then they were done, in five minutes. In Red Square, anyone can do anything on the Red Square. It\u2019s that you get arrested afterwards. And they did get arrested. They got a minor charge, a $30 penalty and that\u2019s it. A so-called administrative arrest. CNN: What role have art and this band played in the anti-Putin protest movement? Verzilov: Quite a big role. These actions provide visual language for public protest in Russia. So people see that political issues can be raised in a variety of very different ways. It\u2019s not only boring men in suits talking budget issues. It\u2019s young, very active aggressive, creative people \u2013 artists \u2013 raising these same political questions. So everyone has to do politics. This is the main issue. And everyone has to do politics in the way that is closest to you. CNN: What do you think will happen with the protest movement? Verzilov: Well, it definitely will grow. What we saw after May 6 \u2013 when there was a violent crackdown on people protesting \u2013 we saw people go out on the street the next day and the two days after that even more. So there were more people going out in Moscow and getting arrested and saying they can do what they want to. CNN: What do you see as the outcome of that? Do you expect change? Verzilov: Obviously the government will have to react in some way. You can disperse a 10,000 person demonstration with riot police. But you can\u2019t do nothing against a 100,000 people demonstration, and against thousands of people who are constantly on the streets. CNN: For you, what\u2019s your reason for wanting to be involved politically? Verzilov: Putin is returning Russia to one of the darkest Soviet years. And that\u2019s 1985. That\u2019s basically the height of Putin\u2019s youth and of his KGB career. You have this saying, I think it exists in English as well, \u201cThe darkest hour is before sunrise.\u201d Nineteen-eighty-five was the year before the perestroika, and it was much more brutal than the \u201960s and \u201870s. You had artists being sent to the army, you had people being arrested and the next year (Mikhail) Gorbachev came to power and the perestroika started. So while Putin sees Russia best at its 1985 level, we don\u2019t want that to happen. So we have to fight and resist against that. People should get involved and try to do their own Pussy Riot stuff. This is what it\u2019s all about. It\u2019s an open concept that welcomes everyone to join in and do what they can. CNN: So you want people to put on masks and stage their own concerts? Verzilov: Exactly."

The wreath-laying happened a day after London detectives were granted visas to visit Libya to continue their investigation of Yvonne Fletcher\u2019s death. Libyan Prime Minister Abdurrahim El-Keib walked up to the memorial at St. James\u2019s Square in central London and laid the white wreath at the spot where Fletcher died, where a marker reads \u201cHere fell WPC Yvonne Fletcher, 17th April 1984.\u201d Fletcher was policing a demonstration outside the Libyan offices when a bullet fired from inside the building struck her in the back and killed her, authorities said. Ten demonstrators also were injured in the incident, authorities said. British Prime Minister David Cameron said in a statement Friday that he was pleased that detectives were going to Libya, calling it \u201ca really positive step forward.\u201d London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service said Thursday that the investigation has remained open and that the Counter Terrorism Command wants to find those responsible for Fletcher\u2019s death. Investigators have visited Libya several times and met with officials from the Libyan investigative team, including in 2004, 2006 and 2007, authorities said. Fletcher\u2019s death is under joint investigation by London and Libyan authorities, London police said."

Three-time winners Santos, trailing 1-0 heading into Thursday\u2019s second leg, were boosted when Velez goalkeeper Marcelo Barovero was sent off for bringing down attacking star Neymar. The Brazilian giants struggled to make their numerical advantage count, but finally made the breakthrough after 77 minutes when striker Alan Kardec converted in fine fashion following good work from defender Leo. In the shootout, Santos goalkeeper Rafael was the hero, with his save from fullback Emiliano Papa proving to be the difference between the two sides. Who are European football\u2019s MVPs? \u201cVelez were very difficult rivals, but I think we deserve the qualification,\u201d Rafael said on FIFA\u2019s official website. \u201cNow we have to work harder because Corinthians will be a harder challenge.\u201d Corinthians, seeking a first win in South America\u2019s premier club competition, booked their place in the last four by defeating fellow Brazilians Vasco da Gama on Wednesday. Thursday\u2019s other quarterfinal was also decided by a penalty shootout, with Universidad de Chile advancing at the expense of Paraguay\u2019s Libertad. With the scores level at 1-1 after the first leg, Universidad drew first blood in front of their own fans through Marcelo Diaz\u2019s 18th-minute free-kick. But just four minutes later, Universidad handed Libertad a lifeline when defender Osvaldo Gonzalez put the ball past his own goalkeeper to make the score 2-2 on aggregate. Victor Hugo Ayala saw his spot kick saved by Universidad\u2019s Johnny Herrera, meaning the Chilean team set up a semifinal with Argentina\u2019s six-time champions Boca Juniors."

        "content": "Audio recordings locked inside a college library in the United States might help solve a decades-old murder mystery, but the release of those tapes could damage the fragile peace in Northern Ireland.  In December 1972, the widow Jean McConville was taken from her home in Belfast and her 10 children. \u201cThey came about tea time and they dragged her out of the bathroom and dragged her out,\u201d remembers McConville\u2019s daughter, Helen McKendry, who was then a teenager. Ever since, McKendry has been on a 40-year quest for answers.   \u201cAll I ever wanted was to know the reason why they killed my mother,\u201d McKendry explained.   \u201cI\u2019ve lived all my life in fear,\u201d McKendry added. \u201cThey destroyed my mother\u2019s life, my family life.\u201d  McKendry believes tapes locked away in Boston College\u2019s library may hold the truth about her mother\u2019s fate.  But there are fears that the tapes may also cause embarrassment or worse for Gerry Adams, the prominent Catholic politician who helped broker peace in Northern Ireland. The recordings were made as part of the Belfast Project, which is a collection of interviews conducted with former Northern Irish paramilitary fighters. They provide an oral history of the decades of sectarian fighting that became known as The Troubles. Reminders of Irish \u2018troubles\u2019 rise to surface Northern Ireland is part of Britain and Protestant fighters wanted to keep it that way. Catholics were fighting to force the British out and reunify the north with the rest of Ireland. The former combatants believed that their recorded interviews would be kept secret until their death. But that may no longer be possible as Northern Irish police are asking the United States government to hand over some of the tapes. The police say they were alerted to the secret archive by the book, \u201cVoices from the Grave,\u201d written by Belfast Project archive manager Ed Moloney, which is based on transcripts from two of the recorded interviews.  One of those featured is Brendan Hughes, a now-deceased former commander of the Irish Republican Army or IRA, a Catholic paramilitary.   Hughes told his interviewer:  \u201cI have never, ever, ever admitted being a member of the IRA, ever. I\u2019ve just done it here.\u201d And he talked about Jean McConville\u2019s murder, stating: \u201cI knew she was being executed. I knew that.  I didn\u2019t know she was going to be buried or disappeared as they call them now.\u201d Hughes went on to allege Gerry Adams was involved: \u201cThe special squad was brought into the operation then, called The Unknowns.  You know when anyone needed to be taken away they normally done it.  I had no control over this squad.  Gerry had control over this particular squad.\u201d Hughes added he regretted what happened:  \u201cLooking back on it now, what happened to the woman was wrong.\u201d Hughes said in his taped interview, McConville was killed because the IRA believed she was working with the British army. The McKendrys do not believe she was a spy, saying she was too busy looking after her 10 children to be an informer. Gerry Adams, leader of Northern Ireland\u2019s Sinn Fein party, refused to be interviewed by CNN for this story.  But, he has said many times before that he was never in the IRA and never involved in the death of Jean McConville, and has labeled as libelous any allegation he was involved in the McConville murder. His spokesman goes further, labeling Adams\u2019 critics as anti the peace process. Adams\u2019 denial of IRA membership angers his old comrades like Hughes. \u201cIt means that people like myself had to carry the responsibility of all those deaths,\u201d Hughes said on the interview tape. \u201cGerry was a major, major player in the war and yet he\u2019s standing there denying it.\u201d The Northern Irish police vow to \u201cfollow the material in the Boston Archives all way to court if that\u2019s where it takes them \u2026 they say detectives have a legal responsibility to investigate murders \u2026 and follow all lines of inquiry.\u201d The British government\u2019s most senior politician on Northern Ireland, Owen Paterson told CNN that no one person is above the law. \u201cThere can be no concept on amnesty, so we have to support the police to have complete operational independence in pursuing every line of inquiry in bringing those who committed crimes to justice,\u201d Paterson said. Right now the Boston archive manager, Ed Moloney, is furious with Boston College for initially giving in too quickly to subpoenas demanding they hand over some of the tapes to a U.S. judge. He says it puts lives in danger, damages the future of truth recovery, oral histories and academic research. Moloney \u2013 who is appealing to try to stop the court from handing the tapes it has to police \u2013 wants the tapes handed back to the people who told their stories.  \u201cBoston College is no longer a fit and proper place to keep these interviews,\u201d Moloney insists. \u201cThe archives should be closed down, and the interviews should be returned to the people who gave them because they\u2019re not safe.\u201d But there seems to be little chance of that, Boston College\u2019s spokesman Jack Dunn blames Moloney.  \u201cFrom the beginning, we said to the project organizer, who approached us with this idea, that there were limitations regarding the assurances of confidentiality under American law,\u201d Dunn said.   But what worries Moloney is that if the police get tapes relating to Jean McConville\u2019s murder, they could quickly find other crimes to investigate implicating more political leaders and the police could soon demand all the tapes in the archive. Few believe the police will get Adams to court in part because he is inoculated from prosecution by his central role silencing IRA guns and delivering peace, and in part because the tapes alone cannot secure a conviction. Former IRA man Richard O\u2019Rawe recorded a statement for the Boston College archives and says lawyers told him under UK law the tapes cannot be used in court. \u201cI find it just imponderable, why the police are going down this road when they must know that there is no chance of obtaining any convictions at the end of this,\u201d O\u2019Rawe says.   Like many other Catholics, O\u2019Rawe thinks the police are biased against them, trying to settle old scores and bring Adams and others down. But for Helen McKendry, herself a Catholic getting access to the tapes is about so much more. For her, it\u2019s not only about justice but a release from the pain of never knowing the truth.   \u201cThey tried to destroy what life I have now,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are the people who committed the crimes in this. They should be worried.\u201d"

        "content": "To the rest of the world, Sweden seems to represent all that is enviably European. Scandinavia\u2019s largest country has a reputation for being stylish, progressive and glacially cool \u2013 in short, everything the Eurovision Song Contest is not. So it may come as a surprise to some to learn that the Swedes take the annual song competition \u2013 occasionally viewed by some of their neighbors as a bit of a joke \u2013 very seriously indeed. Unlike in many other western European countries, the privilege of representing Sweden at the annual contest is hotly contested, through a grueling series of televised heats which have grown to become more popular than Eurovision itself. Melodifestivalen, a six-week, \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d-style TV series in which established acts compete against unknowns for the honor of representing Sweden, has broken every local ratings record. Nearly half of the country\u2019s 9.4 million people tuned in to this year\u2019s final. \u201cMelodifestivalens is the Swedish equivalent to the Superbowl,\u201d said Per Blankens who produced the TV show in 2006 and 2007. \u201cNo other TV show gets the Swedes so rallied up. People put on dinner parties just so they can watch it together. They even get dressed up for the occasion.\u201d Forgettable song, memorable outfit: The crazy clothes of Eurovision  The show has proven an invigorating force for the Swedish music industry, reviving old pop careers, launching new ones and selling thousands of records and concert tickets in the process. But why do the Swedes, often viewed as cool, collected tastemakers, get so worked up about a contest widely seen as having little musical credibility? Proud tradition \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know this, but Swedes are obsessed with music,\u201d said Blankens, who followed his stint on Melodifestivalen (Melody Festival) by producing the Swedish version of American Idol. \u201cNot only are all the most popular TV shows in Sweden music-related, but choral singing is the second most popular pastime after sports. It\u2019s only natural for us to get worked up about a music competition.\u201d That love of music has translated to a long history of Eurovision success, with the most wins in the competition after Ireland (seven), France, Luxembourg and the UK (five each). The Netherlands has also won four times. The love affair began when ABBA won the 1974 contest with their hit \u201cWaterloo,\u201d launching them on their way to becoming Eurovision\u2019s greatest success story and one of the biggest-selling pop bands of all time.  The Swedish entry this year, \u201cEuphoria\u201d by Loreen, was the bookies\u2019 favorite to follow in their footsteps and duly delivered success at the 57th Eurovision, in Baku, Azerbaijan. The tradition of success has seen many Swedes grow up with \u201cMelodifestivalen\u201d and Eurovision as annual fixtures in their households. \u201cWatching Eurovision is a national tradition in Sweden,\u201d said Maria Akesson, 28, a motion graphics student from Stockholm. \u201cWhen I was a kid it was the only night, apart from New Year\u2019s Eve, that my parents would allow me to stay up past midnight and let me eat as much crisps and candy as I liked.\u201d Even as an adult, Eurovision remains a big occasion. \u201cI watch it with my friends and there\u2019s always someone who will organize a house party where we\u2019ll cook strange dishes from all the different countries and bet money on what song will win. People usually take the betting really seriously but we add silly categories like the worst outfit or the worst song.\u201d \u201cMelodifestivalen\u201c\u2018s timing \u2013 screening on Saturday nights for six weeks in the middle of the country\u2019s famously gloomy winters \u2013 is seen as another reason for its enduring appeal. \u201cSweden in the winter is very dark and can be quite depressing. When \u2018Melodifestivalen\u2019 starts airing in February we\u2019re in the middle of this season, but every week leading up to the final is a week closer to spring,\u201d said Sebastian Hjalmarsson Downey-Clark, a self-confessed Eurovision addict who works in London as a primary school teacher.  \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if \u2018Melodifestivalen\u2019 is the vessel that carries Sweden from the dark of winter to the light of summer, and soundtracks that journey with some awfully catchy music too.\u201d Reviving the contest \u201cMelodifestivalen\u201d is nearly as old as Eurovision itself, having run almost every year since 1959. But it wasn\u2019t always such a polished affair.  \u201cIn the 1990s the competition was struggling. There weren\u2019t enough good artists wanting to take part so it was decided that something radical needed to happen,\u201d said Christer Bjorkman, a former hairdresser who won \u201cMelodifestivalen\u201d in 1992. So in 2002, he oversaw the transformation of the contest from one-off contest between ten songs into a six-week pop marathon featuring 32. The ultimate winner is decided by a combination of public vote and a jury that consists of Swedish industry experts, and Eurovision judges from 11 other countries.  The new format, featuring knock-out semi-finals held in cities across Sweden, was a smash hit, and Bjorkman has been involved in the production of every contest since. Today he is known as \u201cMr Melodifestivalen.\u201d \u201cTaking the show on the road was incredibly important to its success as it galvanized local support,\u201d he said. \u201cEqually as important was the fact that the audience now have weeks to familiarize themselves with all the songs. They form emotional attachments to the songs and, ultimately, also the winner \u2013 which is one of the reasons why so many Swedes still care about how we do in Eurovision.\u201d The resulting surge of interest in \u201cMelodifestivalen\u201d sees thousands of songs submitted to the contest each year, and has been a boon to the Swedish music industry. \u201cIt\u2019s a goldmine for artists and songwriters that do well in the competition, as they go on to sell thousands of records and sell out tours across Scandinavia,\u201d said Blankens.  Bjorkman agrees. \u201cThe competition is enormously important for the Swedish music industry because not only does it launch new careers and revives old ones, it sells a lot of albums too,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom winter until spring, our songs occupy the charts. The final was in March, but four of our songs are still in the top ten.\u201d \u2018Why not try?\u2019 The Swedes are very aware that not every country shares their infatuation with Eurovision. \u201cBig countries who take themselves quite seriously \u2013 like Britain and France \u2013 don\u2019t really want to compete against all these tiny nations on the European periphery in some silly music competition,\u201d said Blankens. \u201cThey think it\u2019s beneath them, so they keep sending bad songs that never win.\u201d But given the benefits to Sweden\u2019s music industry from the country\u2019s Eurovision obsession, perhaps the question shouldn\u2019t be why does Sweden care, but why don\u2019t others? \u201cUltimately you get what you give,\u201d said Bjorkman. \u201cIn countries like the UK they don\u2019t give much \u2013 in fact they keep changing the format of the national try-outs each year. It\u2019s no wonder the public has lost interest in \u2026 Eurovision.\u201d \u201cMelodifestivalen\u201c\u2018s success owes much to the Swedish tendency not to \u201cdo things by half measures,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we decided to revive \u2018Melodifestivalen,\u2019 our aim was to create an amazing and engaging TV program that would benefit not only us as broadcasters, but the music industry and the viewers as well. I\u2019m very proud to say that we have succeeded in doing just that.\u201d"

        "content": "Being coach of a nation\u2019s football team brings enormous responsibility. The stakes are high, and the weight of expectation is even greater. Some say, for instance, that the England manager\u2019s job is second only in importance to the British Prime Minister\u2019s role \u2013 and Roy Hodgson has already been subject to intense scrutiny before his first match in charge against Norway in this weekend\u2019s Euro 2012 warmup match. But though undeniably demanding, Hodgson\u2019s job is arguably a walk in the park compared to the task facing Kevin McGreskin. On another island group, half a world away \u2013 and light years in terms of sporting and economic development \u2013 the Scottish coach is getting to grips with turning a tiny nation\u2019s team into one recognized by football\u2019s governing body FIFA. Hodgson may have the splendor of Wembley Stadium for home games, but Kiribati\u2019s main pitch has more sand than grass. Part of the Commonwealth, Kiribati is made up of 33 coral islands about 2,500 miles southwest of Hawaii, with a population of just over 100,000. It is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries and the World Bank ranks it as having a gross domestic product only greater than that of Tuvalu.  Who are European football\u2019s \u201cMost Valuable Players?\u201d McGreskin, recently appointed as the Kiribati Football Association\u2019s technical director and head coach,  has worked closely with a number of professional clubs in the UK as well as helping deliver coaching courses for European football\u2019s governing body UEFA.  He must also be the only coach who holds the prestigious UEFA  \u201cA\u201d License qualification through three different national associations \u2013 England, Wales and the Republic of Ireland \u2013 after deciding to research different approaches to the courses.  He is likely to need that raft of qualifications given that Kiribati suffered two 17-1 defeats at the 2011 Pacific Games.  \u201cOne of my aims now is to make us more competitive at international level within the Pacific region,\u201d McGreskin told CNN, laughing at the suggestion he has taken on the toughest coaching job in the world.  \u201cWhile achieving this will improve the status of the national team I also think this will be a very important for the development of game in the country as a whole, as it will offer the young players something positive to aspire to.\u201d While Hodgson\u2019s time will be taken up by analyzing the teams England will face at Euro 2012, handling the egos of millionaire players and enduring  the barbed comments of a critical media, McGreskin\u2019s job description extends to helping the Kiribati Football Association find a sponsor and a kit supplier.  Oh, and given that it is a low-lying Pacific island, global warming could possibly be a concern down the line.  \u201cGenerating this funding will determine how we can implement a range of programs at various levels to really move the game forward in the country,\u201d said McGreskin. His plan to rejuvenate Kiribati will evolve literally one game at a time.  \u201cThis year we plan to participate in an international fixture against Fiji, one of our \u2018local\u2019 neighbors, in July and this will require us to raise considerable sponsorship to achieve this,\u201d said McGreskin. Big-spending Man City top EPL value table  There is also the small matter for McGreskin of helping the Kiribati FA win FIFA recognition, which would allow the islanders to play in international competitions and be eligible to receive funding from football\u2019s global governing body.  \u201cOur recent application was unsuccessful but this will be an ongoing process for us,\u201d said McGreskin. \u201cHowever, while delivering this disappointing news FIFA also promised some assistance in our efforts to develop the game. \u201cThis will be a great help to us and we will continue working towards meeting the membership criteria. It is the country\u2019s ultimate ambition to compete in the World Cup qualifiers.\u201d Of Kiribati\u2019s 33 islands, 21 are inhabited \u2013 though most of its population is based in the Gilbert Islands. Thirty-two are atolls (ring-shaped islands with a central lagoon) while Banaba is a raised coral island. Player selection is also a challenge, with just 2,351 registered male players over the age of 18 in Kiribati and only 468 women players. The islands extend 2,400 miles from east to west, so McGreskin also faces a travel headache as he scouts for talent. \u201cThe land mass of the country may be small but it is spread out over a huge area, so it offers a fairly unique logistical problem \u2013 particularly if you need to implement a regular league season,\u201d he said.  \u201cThere is a huge passion for the game in the country and although there isn\u2019t much room for football pitches, there is still at least one on each of the islands.  \u201cThis means that the pitches that are available are played on almost all of the time, which means the surfaces aren\u2019t the best.\u201d Surrounded by palm trees, Kiribati\u2019s Bairiki National Stadium looks about as idyllic a location as you could want from a football ground, but with one small hitch \u2013 it does not have much grass. Indeed it has so little, the pitch could double up as a beach. \u201cThe installation of a 3G all-weather pitch would be of huge benefit to us on the main island as it would be used regularly and mean less wear on our stadium pitch, which would give us the chance to maintain it to international standard, and help us achieve our ambition of hosting a home international match,\u201d added McGreskin. \u201cMaybe this is one of the projects FIFA can help us with.\u201d McGreskin might not be a household name but he is quietly establishing a reputation as one of Britain\u2019s more innovative coaches. He believes that for too long England has been coaching players in \u201cpretty much the same way, but expecting the end product to be different and thinking somehow talent will magically appear.\u201d  An advocate of overload training \u2013 a method which encourages players to concentrate on doing several things at once \u2013 he has devised one exercise in which players have to throw a tennis ball and call out colors while they are passing a football in sequence. \u201cWe are not providing players with the challenges that they need to meet the demands of the modern game,\u201d said McGreskin, who has been working with Scottish professional team Partick Thistle this season. \u201cOverload exercises help the player speed up the feet and the thought process.\u201d McGreskin believes players\u2019 decision-making is often not quick enough, a weakness that is caused by their inability to scan the pitch when they are without the ball.  \u201cDon\u2019t forget almost 98% of the game is played off the ball. Even in a basic passing drill I force the players to work on perception, scanning skills, technique, adjustability, concentration, attention focus and attention bandwidth. It\u2019s quite amazing the effect it can have on players.\u201d So does McGreskin have any advice for Hodgson ahead of Euro 2012? \u201cIn one word: win,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201d I think that has become almost only thing that matters for a coach at that level of the game. \u201cEngland don\u2019t just want to be in a position to participate in the Euros and World Cups, they want to be competing and seriously challenging for the trophy. \u201cHowever, I also think people like to see a steady stream of young talent coming through that also offers hope for the future.  So, while the England manager\u2019s focus is on the full team, I think he should be actively interested in the development squads  at both international and club level.\u201d "

But for the millions who tune in each year, drawn to the promise of outrageous outfits and performances, the contest is as much about spectacle as it is about the music. For diehard fans, what an artist wears can be a bigger talking point than what they sing. The more misguided an outfit, the better. In 1997, fan website House of Eurovision founded the \u201cBarbara Dex Awards,\u201d an annual prize for the worst dressed artist.

But the past 15 years have seen the costumes reach new heights of flamboyance. \u201cVisuals have become so much more important since televoting was introduced in 1998,\u201d said Sam Broderick, a writer for ESC Nation, one of the most popular Eurovision fan websites.  \u201cActs only have three minutes to get their song heard and their message across, and they have to compete against 25 other songs to be remembered,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why so many acts have gimmicks on stage \u2013 and an outrageous costume is just another gimmick. It\u2019s all part of the glitz and the glamor of the contest too, and I think that\u2019s why people love Eurovision.\u201d  But dressing up as a bird, butterfly or robot doesn\u2019t guarantee success. Many of the acts featured in our gallery finished near the bottom of the table, or failed to progress past the semi-finals.  \u201cA terrible outfit can destroy any chances a song may have had,\u201d said Broderick. \u201cI remember watching rehearsals in Oslo in 2010 when the Maltese entrant Thea Garrett came on stage with her backing dancer dressed as a massive bird. The whole press center was in howls of laughter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was quite highly regarded before then, but I really think that big bird put paid to the song\u2019s chances.\u201d"

        "content": "World No. 1 Rory McIlroy lost his cool in the midst of a heatwave at the BMW PGA Championship as Luke Donald stepped up his challenge to usurp the 2011 U.S. Open champion at the top of the rankings. McIlroy, from Northern Ireland, struggled to a two-over-par round of 74 on the opening day at the Wentworth course while Donald, the defending champion, sits within striking distance of the leaders on four-under. Donald can regain the No. 1 spot with victory at the tournament and must finish in the top eight to have a chance of overtaking McIlroy. His six birdies helped him into a tie for eighth place. Scotland\u2019s David Drysdale and Ireland\u2019s Peter Lawrie lead on six-under after day one with England\u2019s Justin Rose and Alavaro Quiros, from Spain, in a group of five players one shot back. Donald targets No. 1 spot after European Tour award McIlroy\u2019s round included a run of four bogeys in five holes and at one stage he hurled a club to the floor in frustration after a poor shot.  \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of deja vu from last year,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI kept getting off to good starts and sort of making a few bogeys around the turn and not getting any momentum back. \u201cTwo under through seven, feel like I\u2019m playing well, then I make four bogeys in five holes. It\u2019s pretty disappointing and I feel like I\u2019m playing pretty well, I just need to go out there and shoot a score.\u201d McIlroy\u2019s compatriot Graeme McDowell\u2019s round turned sour shortly after he\u2019d walked off the 18th green as his ball was shown to have moved prior to hitting his second shot from the rough on the closing hole. The 2010 U.S. Open champion was unaware the ball had moved and he was penalised two strokes \u2013 one for not replacing the ball into its original position and one for striking it from the wrong place. It turned his round of level par into a round of two-over. He told reporters: \u201cHow are you supposed to attempt to place the ball when you\u2019re not sure it\u2019s moved in the first place? It\u2019s just a harsh one \u2013 one of those freak scenarios in golf. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I probably should have called for a referee. That would have saved me one shot, but what are you supposed to do \u2013 the whole area was sort of bouncing. \u201cI was aware of it and asked for it to be looked at. The rules are there for everybody\u2019s protection.\u201d Three-time major champion Ernie Els, from South Africa, is on four-under and compatriot Charl Schwartzel, the 2011 Masters champion, finished on three-under.   Former world No. 1 Lee Westwood, who was beaten by Donald in a playoff at last year\u2019s tournament, birdied the last to finish two-under."

        "content": "Formula One\u2019s 12 teams have struck an agreement to secure the future of the sport until 2020, Bernie Ecclestone has exclusively told CNN. The F1 CEO revealed a new eight-year deal that will bind all 12 constructors in the elite division of motorsport beyond the current \u201cConcorde Agreement\u201d that expires at the end of this season. The contract outlines the terms by which teams compete in Formula One and how the lucrative prize money and television revenues on offer are divided. Progress on the deal has been complicated by F1\u2019s planned public offering on the Singapore stock market that could yield around $3 billion. Vettel: Monaco no place for \u2018sissies\u2019 In March the majority of the teams had agreed in principle to tie themselves to an extension of the Concorde Agreement that was most recently signed in 2009, but doubts remained over Mercedes. The German constructor, who have seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher in their ranks, were reported to be considering quitting the sport but during an interview in Monaco, Ecclestone said an agreement had been reached. \u201cWell we\u2019ve just got people now, all the current teams, to sign up until 2020 and then I hope another 10 years after that and then forever. Everybody has agreed with it,\u201d he told CNN World Sport anchor Amanda Davies. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to wait to see if Mercedes have but I\u2019m confident everything with Mercedes will be fine,\u201d Ecclestone added.  When asked if his concerns about Mercedes pulling out of the sport had gone he replied: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Should F1 be so unpredictable? The Concorde Agreement is between Formula One\u2019s governing body, the FIA, the sport\u2019s rights holders and the Formula One Teams Association (FOTA). High-profile teams Red Bull, for whom double world champion Sebastian Vettel drives, and iconic constructor Ferrari have recently withdrawn from FOTA, adding complications to the negotiation process. Mercedes were said to be seeking clarification of their part in F1\u2019s future plans, insisting on a more prominent role than offered having been a part of the sport since the 1950s. The iconic Silver Arrow version of the Mercedes led the team to back-to-back championships in the 1950s and immortalized the car in motorsport\u2019s history. And they were said to be threatening to withdraw from the sport altogether but Ecclestone\u2019s revelation signals a breakthrough in discussions and an end in sight to a saga that had threatened to rumble on through the current season. \u201cI appreciate and support Mercedes probably more than anyone in F1,\u201d said Ecclestone. \u201cBut the way it was done was on results and we couldn\u2019t falsify the results because if we did other people would complain.\u201d Ecclestone also suggested that reports of Formula One listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange might be premature. \u201cThe market doesn\u2019t look too bright after that little bit of a problem with Facebook,\u201d said Ecclestone, referring to the social networking website\u2019s recent public offering. \u201cSo I think they are going to wait and see.\u201d  "

        "content": "It was the scene for one of the most famous controversies in soccer history. Did England striker Geoff Hurst\u2019s shot during the 1966 World Cup final at Wembley cross the line? The Russian who was running the line that day thought so and his decision helped England to a 4-2 win over West Germany \u2013 their only major tournament success to date. Forty-six years later, the same London stadium will provide the setting for a major test of pioneering goal-line technology (GLT), that could revolutionize the game of football forever. British firm \u201cHawk-eye\u201d employ a series of cameras mounted inside the goal frame and their approach will be tested during England\u2019s Euro 2012 warm-up match with Belgium, though none of the information will be available to the match officials. Goal-line technology enters final testing  Scientists and FIFA officials will analyze the results and if they prove successful, the technology could be ratified at a meeting of the International Football Association Board (IFAB) in early July. The experiment in front of an estimated crowd of 90,000 at Wembley follows the first Hawk-eye trial at a non-league English cup match earlier this month. An alternative system, designed by German company \u201cGoalRef\u201d is also in the final stages of testing. It is somewhat ironic the technology is to be examined during an England match as the team were on the wrong end of a refereeing decision at the 2010 World Cup. Frank Lampard\u2019s shot was disallowed during a second round match with Germany despite replays showing the ball was a full yard over the goal-line.  That incident in South Africa prompted FIFA to overturn their long-held stance on goal-line technology and begin trials. A statement on FIFA\u2019s website said:  \u201cOnly the EMPA observers, IFAB and FIFA representatives at Wembley will have access to the GLT system readings.  \u201cTherefore, should a goal-line incident occur at this or any of the \u2018test\u2019 matches, the system will not be utilized by the match officials. It means the GLT system will have no influence on the outcome of the matches in which the system is being tested. \u201cSuch tests, along with those being conducted for the GoalRef system in Denmark, could lead to the International Football Association Board approving the introduction of GLT at its special meeting at the beginning of July.\u201d There have been several contentious incidents in the last English season that has renewed calls for the technology to be introduced. Chelsea were awarded a goal in an FA Cup semifinal against Tottenham at Wembley that was shown not to have crossed the line, while Queens Park Rangers defender Clint Hill\u2019s header against Bolton wasn\u2019t given despite being well over the line. English Premier League chairman Richard Scudamore has said he is keen to introduce the technology next season if it is rubber-stamped by FIFA. FIFA have also confirmed that referees are to be drug tested to check they are not taking performance enhancing substances.  At a meeting of the world governing body\u2019s executive committee, chief medical officer Jiri Dvorak said match officials should be subject to the same tests as players. \u201cWe have to consider referees as part of the game,\u201d he was quoted as saying by the UK Press Association. \u201cWe have started to discuss this and this is something for the future which will be discussed to include possibly an anti-doping program for referees. \u201cWe do not have an indication that this is a problem but this is something we have to look at. The referees are a neglected population.\u201d"

        "content": "The president of the Vatican Bank is expected to lose his job when the Commission of Cardinals meets Friday, according to Vatican analyst John Allen. The board that oversees the bank unanimously passed a vote of \u201cno confidence\u201d for Ettore Gotti Tedeschi on Thursday, setting the stage of the Italian economist\u2019s ouster. A statement from the board said that \u201cdespite repeated notices\u201d to Tedeschi, \u201cthe situation has deteriorated further\u201d at the Vatican Bank.  Replacing Tedeschi is \u201cimportant to maintain the vitality\u201d of the bank, the board said. \u201cThe Council is now looking forward to the process of finding a new and excellent President,\u201d the statement said. Allen, who covers the Vatican for the National Catholic Reporter, said the cardinals have the final word, but all indications say they will ratify the decision to oust Tedeschi at their meeting Friday. Tedeschi, who is a celebrity in Italy often seen on television, was hired in 2009 with the expectation that he would be a \u201cwhite knight\u201d to clean up the Vatican Bank\u2019s reputation.  \u201cBut he never took the job seriously,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThe expectation when he was named is that he would be hands on and right the ship and, in fact, he\u2019s been spending only about two days a week there and doing virtually nothing,\u201d Allen said.  \u201cThere\u2019s great frustration that he seemed to be a do-nothing administrator popping into the office to pick up mail and publicize his lectures and books.\u201d There has also be a \u201cproblem of chemistry\u201d between Tedeschi and Paolo Cipriani, the director who runs the bank on a daily basis, Allen said. The Vatican Bank has been under pressure for the past several years to adapt to meet international standards on money-laundering and other illegal activities, a goal that Pope Benedict XVI decreed it would meet. But there has been growing frustration that the progress was too slow, Allen said.  The changes were scheduled to be complete in June, but the bank is not now expected to meet the deadline, he said. The Vatican Bank is \u201cthe most secret bank in the world,\u201d according to Jeffrey Robinson, who wrote \u201cThe Laundrymen,\u201d a book about money laundering worldwide. The Vatican\u2019s sources of income include its vast real estate holdings, and there is no way to find out how much money the bank controls, Robinson said. The Vatican Bank was created by an order of the pope \u201cto carry on activities that are for pious causes,\u201d according to expert testimony related to a lawsuit by Holocaust survivors against the bank in a U.S. court in 2009. It accepts deposits only from top Catholic Church officials and entities, Settimio Caridi testified in U.S. District Court in 2006. It uses its funds \u201cfor designated pious purposes\u201d and is \u201can autonomous pious foundation,\u201d he said. Caridi, a top Italian legal scholar who was called to testify by Vatican lawyers, said the bank is an integral part of the Vatican, a \u201ccentral entity under the oversight of the Holy See.\u201d It is ultimately overseen by a commission of five cardinals \u2013 the top position in the Vatican hierarchy below the pope \u2013 which is headed by the Vatican secretary of state. The Vatican Bank is subject to particularly stringent anti-money-laundering regulations because Italian law does not consider it to be operating within the European Union. It must supply more detailed information about transactions than European Union banks have to give."

Argentina\u2019s Boca Juniors, six-time winners of the continent\u2019s premier club competition, snatched a 2-1 aggregate win over Brazil\u2019s Fluminense thanks to a 90th-minute goal from Uruguayan Santiago Silva.

After following a line of golden trumpets and heavy maces, they are introduced to the regalia of the ceremony: Robes, anointing oil and ceremonial swords, before coming face to face with the fabled gems themselves, set in a succession of stunning crowns, scepters and orbs. Fashion and treats fit for a Queen Even their names are the stuff of legend: Koh-i\u2013Nur, the Black Prince\u2019s Ruby, Cullinane I and II, King Edward\u2019s Sapphire. Some even come with their own superstitions. The Koh-i-Nur (its name means \u201cMountain of Light\u201d), for example, is only ever set in crowns made for female members of the monarchy. Read more: The Royal family tree \u201cIt is said to bring bad luck to any man who wears it,\u201d explained Keith Hanson, the chief exhibitor of the jewels. \u201cBy contrast, it is believed to bring long life and happiness to any woman who wears it, and as its last wearer, Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, was 101 when she died, that would seem to be true.\u201d The jewels that visitors see today have been worn by British monarchs for generations, but in historical terms, Dixon-Smith says, they are \u201ca relatively new collection.\u201d The originals were destroyed in the wake of the Civil War, which saw King Charles I overthrown and executed in 1649. The oldest piece on display is the 12th century Coronation Spoon, which survived the break-up (and melting down) of the old jewels. Many of the items in the Tower of London today date back to the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, and the rule of King Charles II, though the collection has been added to and expanded over the centuries since. Perhaps the most important piece is the St Edward\u2019s Crown, which dates from 1661, and is worn by the monarch at the moment of coronation. Made of solid gold and trimmed with ermine and velvet, it is famously heavy \u2013 weighing more than five pounds (2.23kg) \u2013 and can only be worn for 15 minutes during the ceremony. Read more: What does the queen really do?  By contrast, Queen Victoria\u2019s tiny diamond-encrusted crown, made in 1870, measures less than 10cm (3.7 inches) tall. It was designed to be worn over her mourning veil, following the death of her beloved husband, Prince Albert. And while Queen Victoria wore that miniature coronet so often it was eventually placed on her coffin, after her death, one of the other pieces, the Imperial Crown of India has only been used once. The crown, which features more than 6,000 diamonds, rubies, sapphires and emeralds, was made in 1911 at a cost of \u00a360,000. It was used for the crowning of George V at the Delhi Durbar, because the traditional Crown Jewels are not permitted to leave the country, but has not been worn since. The new exhibition has been six years in the making, with most of the work being carried out overnight, to allow the Crown Jewels to remain on display throughout. Thousands of visitors pour in to the Tower of London every day, though Hanson insists \u201cthere are no queues here \u2013 only \u2018lines of expectation.\u2019\u201d And the fact that the jewels are one of the key attractions for international visitors to London has played a large role in the way they are now displayed, with little writing and a reliance instead on imagery and film, from animations, to painting, to film of the Queen\u2019s 1953 coronation. \u201cThe point is not to tell people about the collection, but to show them \u2013 the Crown Jewels are the stars of the show,\u201d said interpretation manager Rebecca Richards. The exhibition also features dramatic lighting and sound effects, designed to allow the precious stones and gold to glow and shine in all their glory. \u201cThey are not relics,\u201d said Richards. \u201cThey are part of an active tradition, and they are still used today.\u201d  So while anyone making a trip to the Tower can expect to be greeted by plenty of glitz and sparkle whenever they visit, they shouldn\u2019t be too surprised if they find a small card in place of the Imperial State Crown, reading simply: \u201cIn use.\u201d"

        "content": "Known as much for his gaffes, brusque manner and eccentricities as for his charity and campaigning work, Prince Philip seems to have lived a life permanently in the shadow of his wife, Queen Elizabeth II. Yet as a child born into the turmoil of inter-war Europe, a naval officer decorated for heroism in World War II, and one half of one of the most-enduring modern royal marriages, the Duke of Edinburgh is an extraordinary figure in his own right. And while Britain celebrated 60 years since the queen succeeded as monarch earlier this year, the spotlight also shone on the man who has rarely left her side during her time in the spotlight. Prince Philip\u2019s life was dramatic from the outset. The nephew of Greece\u2019s King Constantine I, he was born in 1921 on the dining room table of a villa on the Greek island of Corfu. Known then simply as Philip \u2013 he had no official surname \u2013 he was forced into exile just 18 months later when the Greek monarchy was overthrown by a military revolt. Sailors on board HMS Calypso, the British cruiser given the secret mission to carry his family to safety, made him a crib out of an old fruit box. Stateless and (by royal standards) poor, Philip\u2019s family spent the next few years wandering between the homes of European relatives as the continent descended into the political and economic upheaval that would lead to World War II. After his mother Alice was committed to a psychiatric clinic in 1930, Philip rarely saw his parents. He was instead mentored by an uncle, Lord Mountbatten, and dispatched to a series of boarding schools in England, Germany and Scotland. In 1936, Greece voted to reinstate its monarchy, but Philip\u2019s father Andrea resisted pressure to push his son into Greek military service. Instead, Philip remained at Gordonstoun, the school in Scotland where he would later send his own sons, and began to prepare for training in Britain\u2019s Royal Navy. By the time he reached his late teens, Philip\u2019s dashing looks were turning heads, including the 13-year-old distant cousin (they are both great, great grandchildren of Queen Victoria) who would later become his bride. But naval duty came first, and with the outbreak of war, Philip was sent to sea. As a citizen of Greece, Philip was initially deployed as a \u201cneutral foreigner\u201d serving on naval escort and convoy missions. But after Italy invaded Greece in 1940 he was assigned to Valiant, a battleship that would soon see action in the Mediterranean. Philip was commended for his operation of searchlights during a 1941 night battle near Cape Matapan, where the British destroyed much of the Italian fleet. He was later awarded the Greek War Cross of Valor. After various postings and promotions, Philip was in 1944 appointed first lieutenant of HMS Whelp, a destroyer that went on to see action in the Pacific as part of a British fleet involved with joint operations with the U.S. Navy, including the landings at Iwo Jima. When peace came, Philip remained in the navy, but rekindled a friendship with Elizabeth that quickly blossomed into a public romance. The pair were married in Westminster Abbey in 1947 and shortly afterwards he returned to duty, rising to the rank of lieutenant commander. See also: The Royal family tree Newly-appointed as Duke of Edinburgh, Philip had to abandon his naval career for royal duties after the queen\u2019s father, George VI became ill. The king died while Philip and Elizabeth were on an official trip to Kenya. It was Philip who broke the news to his wife \u2013 now the queen. The early years of the the couple\u2019s marriage saw the prince enjoy the height of his popularity. On a 1951 trip to Canada, crowds of admiring women turned out to see the handsome prince. In 1957, Time magazine said he had transformed his \u201cfrosty bride\u201d into a \u201cstylish\u201d royal icon. While affection for the duke remains strong today \u2013 as was shown by an outpouring of concern when he underwent heart surgery last year \u2013 his public image as a dashing young man has long since been replaced by one of an irascible older figure. Many have drawn links between the duke\u2019s manner and his experiences as a young man, suggesting his troubled family life helped shape a rather detached and unemotional outlook, while his navy career endowed him with a salty wit that frequently raises eyebrows. Others attest to his charisma and charm, characteristics that no doubt helped fuel rumors of indiscretions in the early years of his marriage. In 1956, the year before Philip was officially appointed as a prince, the queen\u2019s household had to officially deny such rumors. The duke himself has spoken of his own struggles to find a purpose within the royal family, saying he took on patronages \u2013 including the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme he created to recognize community service \u2013 out of duty rather than passion. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be president of the World Wildlife Fund,\u201d he said in an interview in 1992. \u201cI was asked to do it. I\u2019d much rather have stayed in the navy, frankly.\u201d Yet he has found time to pursue his own, sometimes odd, interests. Over the years these have included polo, competitive horse carriage driving (a sport in which he has represented Britain) science, the study of UFOs, practical jokes, painting and taking the wheel of his own London taxi. But despite several recent high profile appearances, the duke has taken a step back from public life in the past year. \u201cI reckon I\u2019ve done my bit,\u201d he said in a 2011 interview. \u201cI want to enjoy myself a bit now, with less responsibility, less frantic rushing about, less preparation, less trying to think of something to say.\u201d"

The Red Bull driver knows what it takes to succeed at the legendary circuit having taken the checkered flag in last year\u2019s grand prix and he said no error goes unpunished around Monte Carlo\u2019s narrow streets. \u201cAny mistake is coming back with a vengeance and still you have to beat the car around the corners without mercy,\u201d the 24-year-old told the sport\u2019s official website. \u201cThis is no place for sissies and Sunday drivers. Cruising will not do here \u2013 you have to go to the limit every single lap. That is what makes Monaco so special in the car. The atmosphere and flair of the city is just an extra.\u201d Should Formula One be so unpredictable? The layout of the Monaco circuit sets it apart from other venues in the elite division of motorsport and the track includes a number of iconic corners and bends. When asked which corner he finds most challenging, Vettel replied:  \u201cCasino. You arrive there at more than 250km/h in seventh gear and have to hang on to that in some sort of blind flying until you are over the camber and go into turns three and four. \u201cIt is there where you really have to go to the limit. What you don\u2019t see on television is how much it goes up and down there \u2013 that requires a strong stomach! You don\u2019t have too much time to reflect \u2013 it is more gut reaction.\u201d Vettel romped to world championship glory in 2011, winning 11 of 19 races, but it has been a different story so far this season. The opening five grands prix of 2012 have had five different winners, with Vettel currently sharing the lead in the drivers\u2019 standings with Ferrari\u2019s Fernando Alonso after a disappointing sixth-place finish in Spain earlier this month. \u201cThis is a completely different game,\u201d said Vettel on the prospect of a better result in Sunday\u2019s race. \u201cWe are heading into this weekend very open minded. We will see how the car likes to be shaken \u2013 and not stirred.\u201d Vettel outlined the importance of concentration to achieving a positive result at Monaco and he explained how he breaks up the race weekend in his mind. \u201cFirst you have to separate that one, single, fast lap to the race,\u201d said the former Toro Rosso driver. \u201cThat one qualifying lap has to be perfect. Period. You put all your heart and soul into that single lap.  \u201cIn the race you subdivide your concentration by focusing on your car, your tires, your mind and the strategy. You have to get all these points across the finish line. Nothing else will do. \u201cYour concentration has to be exactly where your car is \u2013 hanging on to the last corner or focusing on the next one too soon is a sure way to botch your race.\u201d Despite his optimism, Vettel was off the pace during Thursday\u2019s rain-hit practice sessions. McLaren\u2019s 2009 champion Jenson Button set the fastest time of the day, with a lap of one minute 15.746 seconds before the heavens opened. Vettel was over a second off the pace after registering the 10th-fastest time, while Lotus\u2019 impressive start to the season continued as Romain Grosjean clocked the second-fastest lap. The Ferrari duo of Felipe Massa, who has come under pressure after a string of indifferent performances, and joint championship leader Alonso were third and fourth respectively. "

        "content": "The taste of success is sweet for Maria Sharapova \u2013 in more ways than one. The Russian tennis star is focused on completing a coveted career grand slam of titles at the French Open starting next week, but  she already has plans for her next off-court project. The 25-year-old is the world\u2019s highest-paid female athlete due to her top-end endorsement deals, according to Forbes magazine, and she has another lucrative sideline in the works. Having already designed clothes for Nike and luxury label Cole Haan among her projects, Sharapova is planning to release a line of confectionery called \u201cSugarpova.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m doing everything. The branding and all the shapes of the candy and the gummy-bears,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Open Court. \u201cAnd it is going to launch before the U.S. Open (in September), fingers crossed, so that is my next project.\u201d Sharapova is big business, and she takes it seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s such a different type of work to being a tennis player, working with consumers and understanding what people buy, trend reports, what\u2019s in and what\u2019s out, whether it\u2019s something that is going to last for years,\u201d she said. \u201cI look at it as something that is fun for me, that is creative for me, the thought process of seeing something that is on paper or just an idea. You\u2019re traveling and you see somebody wear a cross-body bag and you\u2019re like, \u2018Wow I love the handle on that,\u2019 and something clicks and you put it on paper and a year later you see it in the stores for people to buy.  \u201cI am just fascinated by that, I think it is an amazing process and I\u2019ve been so fortunate to work with so many great people that teach me so much about different things. I am not a designer, I never went to school for it, but I love being creative and I love learning and understanding what works and what doesn\u2019t work.\u201d That attention to detail has also helped put Sharapova in a position to join an exclusive club of nine tennis players who have won all four grand slam titles, known as a \u201ccareer slam,\u201d having resurrected her fortunes in recent years after a serious shoulder injury. Despite having once described herself as \u201ca cow on ice\u201d on clay, Sharapova has improved her game on the surface to the point where the world No. 2 is now a top contender to win the French Open and add to her Wimbledon, U.S. Open and Australian Open crowns. Last year she reached the semifinals at Roland Garros for the second time, and she already has two tournament wins on red dirt under her belt this season after retaining the Italian Open title last weekend. \u201cThe French Open is always a big goal of mine because I have always said it is going to be the most challenging grand slam for me to win,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether it was when I called myself that cow on ice or whatever it was, but if I go there and play well and physically, I feel healthy and I feel great. There is no reason I can\u2019t win it.  \u201cI\u2019ve been in a couple of semifinals, I believe, last year as well. So, it\u2019s really about (whether) I put myself in that position and win it. I believe in that definitely.\u201d Sharapova has suffered just one defeat on clay all season \u2013 to Serena Williams in the final of the Madrid Open \u2013 and is coming into form at the right time. But despite her fluency on court in the past few weeks she revealed just how taxing the transition from hard courts to the much slower clay surface is every year. \u201cThe first few days on clay are brutal, especially with the practices; you\u2019re just getting your footwork down and the movement,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating. I never crack rackets but those first few days I crack rackets all the time. I\u2019m like \u2018Get me extra rackets!\u2019 \u201cOver the years I think the key for me is being physically stronger, where I have been able to play a match whether it\u2019s three sets or two tough sets and recover for the next day. \u201cIn Europe one of the challenges you have is in one week you could be playing five, six matches a week then you have the next tournament coming up then a week off, then you have a grand slam. \u201cThe physical aspect of all that and mentally understanding that your body has to be ready for all those matches in a short period of time on clay has always been tough for me. \u201cI have always recovered so much better and I move a lot better on it, so yeah it\u2019s nicer, less rackets cracked!\u201d The women often suffer from comparisons to the men, with the exploits of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer cementing this as a golden age of competition in the male arena. But Sharapova insists the women\u2019s game is on an upward curve, with players like Victoria Azarenka, Petra Kvitova and Serena Williams battling it out for major honors, and a new generation of talented youngsters snapping at their heels. \u201cThe level of the game from the first round that you play at a women\u2019s event is so much higher than you would see five, 10 years ago,\u201d she explained. \u201cI kind of felt that I\u2019d come to a tournament, take the first few matches and see it as a warmup, in a way. Everyone in the press was saying why is it always 6-1 6-0 6-2? But now you don\u2019t see that very often. \u201cYou could be facing someone in the first round that is maybe not as consistent but they are experienced, they have beaten top players before and it\u2019s difficult.  \u201cI think that is why you see so much more attendances from the beginning of the week higher than you saw years ago.\u201d Despite perching on the shoulder of history, Sharapova insists such landmarks do not dominate her every thought, though a newfound dedication to her profession was brought into sharp focus due to a serious injury. \u201cI\u2019ve played tennis since I was four years old and when you\u2019re in a match situation \u2013 you could be losing or you\u2019re winning \u2013 there are so many emotions that go into that,\u201d she said.  \u201cEven when I was away from the game for nine months with shoulder surgery and trying to get back, I never, never ever felt that. \u201cThere were so many things I did off the court, just great experiences, wonderful people, I got to work on amazing projects but nothing gave me that feeling of being in those positions where I had to pull out of a match when I was losing. \u201c(When I) had to close it out when I didn\u2019t expect myself to win, it was such an adrenaline rush that you don\u2019t get in many things in life. \u201cWhether it\u2019s playing some small tournament in a small city in front of 2,000 people or whether it\u2019s the finals of Wimbledon where you have an amazing crowd and all that history behind it, it is really at the end of the day trying to make yourself better.\u201d"

        "content": "Joey Barton, one of the most controversial footballers in the English Premier League, has been hit with a 12-match ban by the Football Association (FA). The Queens Park Rangers midfielder, who has 1.5 million followers on micro-blogging site Twitter, was found guilty of two charges of violent conduct during a tumultuous clash with Manchester City earlier this month. Barton was sent off for elbowing Argentina striker Carlos Tevez, then kicked Tevez\u2019s compatriot Sergio Aguero before appearing to aim a headbutt at City captain Vincent Kompany. The 29-year-old attended an FA hearing at Wembley on Wednesday where he was given a \u00a375,000 ($117,000) fine in addition to his lengthy ban. Manchester City win Premier League as Barton sees red In a statement on their official website the FA confirmed Barton would receive an initial four match ban for his dismissal and eight more games for his two further offenses. The FA said: \u201cThere are rules of conduct that should be adhered to, and such behavior tarnishes the image of football in this country, particularly as this match was the pinnacle of the domestic season and watched by millions around the globe.\u201d Barton\u2019s regular rants on Twitter, interspersed with quotes from philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and lyrics from songs of The Smiths, have gained him a huge following. He often tweets about visits to art galleries and his take on modern culture, and he\u2019s also been interviewed on UK political shows such as Newsnight. Barton\u2019s indiscretions at Manchester City are the latest in a long line of misdemeanors in what has been a checkered career to date. He was sentenced to six months in prison while a Newcastle United player for an assault in Liverpool city center and later transfer listed by the club after criticizing the hierarchy on Twitter. Prior to that, at Manchester City, he was fined for stubbing a cigar out in the eye of a youth team player and in a separate incident, was sent home from a tour of Thailand after an altercation with a 15-year-old Everton fan. After his red card at City he took to Twitter to try and explain his actions, stating: \u201cThe head was never gone at any stage, once I\u2019d been sent off, one of our players suggested I should try to take 1 of theirs with me.\u201d His 12-match ban puts his future at QPR in doubt, the team having retained their Premier League status on the final day of the season despite his red card. A Rangers spokesman said: \u201cQPR will be making no comment in regard to the Joey Barton case. An internal investigation will begin in due course.\u201d "

        "content": "Kosovo may not be recognized by the United Nations but the region has taken a giant leap towards acceptance in the soccer world thanks to FIFA\u2019s decision to allow its national team to play in international matches. Football\u2019s world governing body has given dispensation to Kosovo to participate in friendly games against its 208 member states after repeatedly blocking previous requests for recognition. Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008, is not a member of the United Nations \u2013 despite being recognized by 90 countries \u2013 or UEFA, which governs European football. It has been under U.N. administration and patrolled by NATO troops since a 1999 bombing campaign that halted a Serb-led campaign against Kosovo\u2019s ethnic Albanian majority. FIFA president Sepp Blatter told the organization\u2019s executive committee in Budapest that the decision would bring Kosovo into line with other Balkan countries and put it on the path to full membership. But the Football Association of Serbia (FSS) reacted angrily, posting a statement on its official website that spoke of the \u201cnegative and harmful effects\u201d the ruling could have. \u201cWe strongly protest the decision by FIFA\u2019s executive committee to allow the world soccer governing body\u2019s members to play friendly matches with the so-called national team of the so-called Republic of Kosovo,\u201d the FSS said. \u201cThe decision made behind closed doors in Budapest without any consultations with either UEFA or the Serbian Football Association blatantly contravenes the FIFA statutes. \u201cHence we will ask for an urgent meeting with FIFA President Sepp Blatter and his UEFA counterpart Michel Platini to demand a reverse of this unjustified decision which could have far-reaching consequences across the region.\u201d  But in reply, FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke invited the Serbian FA to a meeting at the ruling body\u2019s headquarters in Zurich to discuss the ramifications. In a letter to Tomislav Karadzic, President of the FSS, Valcke said: \u201cWe would like to stress that the FIFA Executive Committee made clear that such authorization does not constitute a step towards FIFA membership, which depends on other considerations. \u201cIn particular, and according to both the current and draft statutes of FIFA, as long as (Football Federation of Kosovo) is not a member of UEFA it cannot be a member of FIFA. The decision was intended purely to support the development of our sport.\u201d Kosovo is recognized by the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany, as well as all its immediate neighbors apart from Serbia."

        "content": "The floral, serene surrounds of London\u2019s Chelsea Flower Show seem a million miles from the screeching, full-throttle action of Formula One. But the two worlds have merged in a unique and award-winning way thanks to the Williams F1 team and a British tree nursery. \u201cThe Williams Story\u201d is a topiary display which depicts the history of the nine-time constructors\u2019 champions, from their origins in 1977 to Pastor Maldonado\u2019s historic victory at the Spanish Grand Prix earlier this month. And, in keeping with the green shoots of recovery which were visible during Williams\u2019 first race win in eight years, the piece features a life-sized topiary Formula One car. The eye-catching display, which also boasts a pit crew sculpted from living trees, has been handed a gold medal at the prestigious annual British horticultural event. \u201cWinning the gold medal is a fantastic achievement,\u201d Williams founder and team principal Frank Williams said. \u201cI saw it for the first time (this week) and was taken aback by its scale and attention to detail.  \u201cThe Chelsea Flower Show is a uniquely British occasion and to be successful at this illustrious event is a great honor. I hope the public enjoy the display as much as the judges.\u201d The topiary took over three years to complete and was sculpted using a fast-growing plant native to south-west China. The honor provides Williams with a timely boost ahead of this weekend\u2019s Monaco Grand Prix, with the team looking to build on Maldonado\u2019s win \u2013 the first by a Venezuelan in the history of the sport. Williams\u2019 celebrations were cut short by a fire in the team garage, a blaze which left seven people in hospital. The incident also resulted in Williams losing vital parts and equipment, but the team\u2019s chief operations engineer Mark Gillan moved to thank the other F1 manufacturers for the support they have shown. \u201cThe team\u2019s preparations for Monaco have been somewhat hampered by last Sunday\u2019s garage fire,\u201d Gillan said on the official F1 website. \u201cBut the impact of the fire has been mitigated by what can only be described as a Herculean effort by the factory and our suppliers to restock both the damaged equipment and car parts. \u201cWe would also like to thank the generous offers of help from the other teams, highlighting once more the excellent sportsmanship that exists in Formula One and high levels of camaraderie throughout the pit lane.\u201d "

        "content": "Jan Petter Vala, who is serving a prison sentence for murder, has hands the size of dinner plates and shoulders like those of an ox. In an alcoholic rage, he used his brutish strength to strangle his girlfriend to death a few years ago. On a recent Thursday, however, at this summer-camp-like island prison in southern Norway, where convicts hold keys to their rooms and there are no armed guards or fences, Vala used those same enormous hands to help bring life into the world.  The 42-year-old murderer stood watch while an oversize cow gave birth to a wobbly, long-legged, brown-and-white calf. He cried as the baby was born, he said, and wiped slime off of the newborn\u2019s face so she could gulp her first breath. Afterward, Vala called his own mother to share the good news.  \u201cI told my family that I\u2019m going to be a dad,\u201d he said, beaming with pride. This is exactly the type of dramatic turnabout \u2013 enraged killer to gentle-giant midwife \u2013 that corrections officials in Norway hope to create with this controversial, one-of-a-kind prison, arguably the cushiest the world has to offer.  Founded in 1982, Bastoy Prison is located on a lush, 1-square-mile island of pine trees and rocky coasts, with views of the ocean that are postcard-worthy. It feels more like a resort than jail, and prisoners here enjoy freedoms that would be unthinkable elsewhere. It\u2019s the holiday version of Alcatraz. Overheard on CNN.com: What\u2019s prison for? There\u2019s a beach where prisoners sunbathe in the summer, plenty of good fishing spots, a sauna and tennis courts. Horses roam gravel roads. Some of the 115 prisoners here \u2013 all men and serving time for murder, rape and trafficking heroin, among other crimes \u2013 stay in wooden cottages, painted cheery red. They come and go as they please. Others live in \u201cThe Big House,\u201d a white mansion on a hill that, on the inside, looks like a college dorm. A chicken lives in the basement, a guard said, and provides eggs for the inmates.  When you ask the cook what\u2019s for dinner, he offers up menu choices like \u201cfish balls with white sauce, with shrimps\u201d and \u201ceverything from chicken con carne to salmon.\u201d  Plenty of people would pay to vacation in a place like this. On first read, all of that probably sounds infuriating. Shouldn\u2019t these men be punished? Why do they get access to all these comforts while others live in poverty? But if the goal of prison is to change people, Bastoy seems to work. \u201cIf we have created a holiday camp for criminals here, so what?\u201d asked Arne Kvernvik Nilsen, the prison\u2019s governor and a former minister and psychologist. He added, \u201cWe should reduce the risk of reoffending, because if we don\u2019t, what\u2019s the point of punishment, except for leaning toward the primitive side of humanity?\u201d Take a quick look at the numbers: Only 20% of prisoners who come through Norway\u2019s prisons reoffend within two years of being released, according to a 2010 report commissioned by the governments of several Nordic countries.  At Bastoy, that figure is even lower, officials say: about 16%.  Compare that with the three-year re-offense rate for state prisons in the U.S.: 43%, according to a 2011 report from the Pew Center on the States, a nonpartisan research group. Older government reports put that number even higher, at more than five in 10. Ryan King, a research director at Pew and an author of the group\u2019s recent report, said it\u2019s difficult to compare recidivism rates from state to state, much less from country to country. Instead of focusing on the numbers, he said, one should focus on what a country is or isn\u2019t doing to tackle re-offense rates. Still, Bastoy remains controversial even in academia. Irvin Waller, president of the International Organization for Victim Assistance and a professor at the University of Ottawa, said in an e-mail that the relative niceness of a prison has no effect on whether people commit crimes when they\u2019re released. \u201cThe key is not that much what happens in prison but what happens when the men are released,\u201d he said. But officials here maintain that their methods do make a difference, and they follow it up with post-release programs. The aim of Bastoy is not to punish or seek revenge, Nilsen said. The only punishment is to take away the prisoner\u2019s right to be a free member of society. Even at a time when Anders\u00a0Behring\u00a0Breivik is on trial in Norway for killing 77 people in a terror attack last year \u2013 and the remote possibility he could end up at Bastoy or a similar prison some day  \u2013 Nilsen and others stand up for this brand of justice.  Life at Bastoy To understand Norway\u2019s pleasant-prison philosophy, first you have to get a sense of how life at a cushy, low-security prison like Bastoy actually plays out. There are few rules here. Prisoners can have TVs in their rooms, provided they bring them from \u201coutside\u201d when they\u2019re sentenced. They wear whatever clothes they want: jeans, T-shirts. One man had a sweater with pink-and-gray horizontal stripes, but that\u2019s as close as it got to the jailbird look. Even guards aren\u2019t dressed in uniform, which makes conducting interviews tricky. It\u2019s impossible to tell an officer from a drug trafficker. A common opening question: \u201cSo, do you live here?\u201d  Everyone at Bastoy has a job, and prisoners must report to work from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. weekdays. Some people garden; others farm. Some chop down trees and slice them into firewood (It\u2019s hard not to think about the wood chipper scene in \u201cFargo\u201d when you see inmates filleting tree trunks with an enormous circular saw). Others tend to a team of horses, which are used to cart wood and supplies from one part of the island to another. Everyone moves about freely during these tasks. Guards are sometimes present, sometimes not. No one wears shackles or electronic monitoring bracelets. The idea is for prison to function like a small, self-sustaining village. For their work, inmates are paid. They get a stipend of 59 Norwegian kroner per day, about $10. They can save that money or spend it on odds and ends in a local shop. Additionally, they get a monthly stipend of about $125 for their food. Kitchen workers \u2013 that\u2019s another inmate job \u2013 serve Bastoy residents dinner each day. For breakfast and lunch, inmates use their stipend to make purchases in the local shop and then cook for themselves at home. Many live in small houses that have full kitchens. Others have access to shared cooking space. The goal, Nilsen said, is to create an environment where people can build self-esteem and reform their lives. \u201cThey look at themselves in the mirror, and they think, \u2018I am s***. I don\u2019t care. I am nothing,\u2019 \u201d he said. This prison, he says, gives them a chance to see they have worth, \u201cto discover, \u2018I\u2019m not such a bad guy.\u2019 \u201c In locked-down prisons, inmates are treated \u201clike animals or robots,\u201d he said, moving from one planned station to the next, with no choice in the matter. Here, inmates are forced to make choices \u2013 to learn how to be better people. Prisoners, of course, appreciate this approach. Kjell Amundsen, a 70-year-old who said he is in jail for a white-collar financial crime, was terrified when he rode the 15-minute ferry from the mainland out to Bastoy.  On a recent afternoon, he was sweeping up in a plant nursery while John Lennon\u2019s \u201cImagine\u201d played on the radio. \u201cI think it\u2019s marvelous to be in a prison this way,\u201d he said.  He plans to keep up the task after his sentence ends. \u201cI\u2019m living in a flat (when I get out), but I am convinced I should have a little garden,\u201d he said. Some prisoners get schooling in a yellow Bavarian-style building near the center of the island. On a recent afternoon, three young men were learning to use computer programs to create 3-D models of cars. All expressed interest in doing this sort of work after their prison terms end.  Tom Remi Berg, a 22-year-old who said he is in prison for the third time after getting into a bar fight and beating a man nearly to death, said he is finally learning his lesson at Bastoy.  He works in the kitchen and is seeking training to become a chef when he\u2019s released. He also plays in the prison blues band \u2013 Guilty as Hell \u2013 and lives with his bandmates. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have a prison like this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can learn to start a new page again.\u201d If escaped, please call The prisoners are required to check in several times a day so guards can make sure they\u2019re still on the island. Nothing but 1\u00bd miles of seawater stops them from leaving; they\u2019d only have to steal one of the prison\u2019s boats to cross it, several inmates said. An escape would be relatively easy. Prisoners have tried to escape in the past. One swam halfway across the channel and became stranded on a buoy and screamed for rescuers to help, prison officials said. Another made it across the channel by stealing a boat but was caught on the other side. Many, however, don\u2019t want to leave. If they tried and failed, they would be forced to go to a higher-security prison and could have their sentences extended. When inmates come to his island jail, Nilsen, the governor, gives them a little talk.  Among the wisdom he imparts is this: If you should escape and make it across the water to the free shore, find a phone and call so I know you\u2019re OK and \u201cso we don\u2019t have to send the coast guard looking for you.\u201d  This kind of trust may seem shocking or na\u00efve from the outside, but it\u2019s the entire basis for Bastoy\u2019s existence. Overnight, only three or four guards (the prison employs 71 administrative staff, including the guards) stay on the island with this group of people who have been convicted of serious crimes. If guards carried weapons (which they don\u2019t) it might encourage inmates to take up arms, too, he said.  Further complicating the security situation, some inmates, toward the end of their terms, are allowed to leave the island on a daily ferry to work or attend classes on the mainland.  They\u2019re expected to come back on their own free will. Inmates are screened to make sure they\u2019re mentally stable and unlikely to plot an escape before they come to Bastoy. The vast majority \u2013 97%, according to Nilsen \u2013 have served part of their sentences at higher-security jails in Norway. In the four years Nilsen has been heading up the prison, there have been no \u201cserious\u201d incidents of violence, he said. By the time they get to Bastoy, inmates view the island as a relief. \u2018It\u2019s still prison\u2019 There\u2019s a question inmates here get asked frequently: When your sentence is up, will you want to leave? The answer, despite the nice conditions, is always an emphatic yes. \u201cIt\u2019s still prison,\u201d said Luke, 23. He didn\u2019t want his full name used for fear future employers would see it. \u201cIn your mind, you are locked (up).\u201d The simple fact of being taken away from family members is enough to stop Benny, 40, from wanting to offend again. The refugee from Kosovo said he was convicted on drug charges after he was found with 13 pounds of heroin. He didn\u2019t want his full name used because he doesn\u2019t want to embarrass his family or jeopardize his chance of finding a job after he\u2019s released. Before coming to Bastoy, he sat in a higher-security prison while one of his children was born. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how long the sentences get. The sentence doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Benny said. \u201cWhen you take freedom from people, that\u2019s what\u2019s scary.\u201d There are only 3,600 people in prison in this country, compared with 2.3 million in the United States, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Relative to population, the U.S. has about 10 times as many inmates as Norway.  More than 89% of Norway\u2019s jail sentences are less than a year, officials said. In U.S. federal prisons, longer sentences are much more common, with fewer than 2% serving a year or less, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Some researchers support Norway\u2019s efforts to lighten sentences. Think of prison like parenting and it starts to make sense, said Mark A.R. Kleiman, a professor of public policy at UCLA and author of \u201cWhen Brute Force Fails.\u201d \u201cEvery parent knows this. What if you tried to discipline your kid by saying, \u2018If you don\u2019t clean your room, there\u2019s a 10% chance I\u2019ll kick you out of the house and never see you again\u2019?\u201d he said, referencing the fact that many crimes in America go unpunished, but the justice system issues harsh sentences when offenders are caught. Grounding the child immediately, a softer sentence, would work better, even though the punishment is less severe, he said.  \u201cWe have a criminal justice system (in the United States) that, if it were a parent, we would say it\u2019s abusive and neglectful.\u201d  Kleiman said victims do have a right to see offenders punished. But in Norway, a country with one of the highest standards of living in the world, staying on a resort-like island with horses might feel like punishment to many people, he said. Research also suggests that programs like Bastoy that train inmates for their transition back into the free world \u2013 with education, counseling and such \u2013 do help prisoners adjust. \u201cThere is overwhelming evidence that rehabilitation works much better than deterrence as a means of reducing re-offending,\u201d said Gerhard Ploeg, a senior adviser at the Ministry of Justice, which oversees Norway\u2019s corrections system. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the name of reintegration,\u201d he added. \u201cYou won\u2019t be suddenly one day standing on the street with a plastic bag of things you had when you came in.\u201d Mass shooting challenges system Norway\u2019s unusual prison policies have been pushed into the international spotlight after a bombing and shooting spree last year in which 77 people were killed, including children. There\u2019s a chance \u2013 although minimal \u2013 that Anders\u00a0Behring\u00a0Breivik, who confessed to those crimes, could end up in Bastoy, one of Norway\u2019s \u201copen prisons,\u201d Nilsen said. Norwegians value respecting killer\u2019s human rights It\u2019s more likely Breivik will be sent to one of  Norway\u2019s many high-security \u201cclosed\u201d prisons, which look much more like their U.S. counterparts.  He also could be set free some day. Norway has a maximum jail sentence of 21 years, which can be extended only when an inmate is deemed to be a real and imminent threat to society. The country expects nearly every prisoner to be returned to society, which influences its efforts to create jail environments that reduce re-offense rates.  Lawyer: Norwegian killer vows not to appeal guilty verdict if found sane \u201cThe question we must ask is, \u2018What kind of person do I want as my neighbor?\u2019 \u201d Ploeg said. \u201cHow do we want people to come out of prison? If your neighbor were to come out of prison, what would you want him to be like?\u201d Still, it\u2019s likely Breivik\u2019s sentence will be extended to the point that he will spend his life in a high-security prison, he said. Or he could go into life-long psychiatric care. Breivik\u2019s case challenges a system that hopes to fix everyone. The case has unearthed levels of anger that are uncharacteristic of Norway, which prides itself as a home for conflict mediation and human rights, a place that hosts the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony and has one of the best standards of living in the world. Last week, a man lit himself on fire outside the Oslo courthouse where Breivik\u2019s trial is taking place. His motives were unclear, police said. \u201c(Breivik) doesn\u2019t deserve to go to prison,\u201d said Camilla Bjerke, 27, who tends bar in Horten, the town on the other side of the water from Bastoy. \u201cHe deserves to be hanged outside the courthouse. \u2026 He\u2019s just going to go into prison and watch TV and download movies.\u201d Then there\u2019s this sentiment: If Breivik were ever released into the public, someone would kill him, several Norwegians said. Inmates at Bastoy echoed those sentiments, saying he would have to be quarantined or he wouldn\u2019t be safe on the island. Others are trying to fight that anger. Bjorn Ihler, a 20-year-old who narrowly escaped Breivik\u2019s shooting spree by diving into the ocean with two children while bullets flew at them, said, \u201cit\u2019s very important that we don\u2019t let this terrorist change the way we are and the way things work.\u201d \u201cThe prison system in Norway is based around the principle of getting criminals back into society, really, and away from their criminal life \u2013 and to get them normal jobs and stuff like that,\u201d he said.  He doesn\u2019t know how he would feel if Breivik were to be released, but he would like the system to function as usual. \u201cSo prisons must be very much focused on getting people to a place where they are able to live normal, non-criminal lives. And that\u2019s the best way of preserving society from crime, I think.\u201d Looking to the future All of these efforts aim to help a person like Vala, the gentle giant who strangled his girlfriend, to get ready for release back into society at the end of his 10-year sentence. After he helped a toddling calf come into the world, Vala said, he leaned on a rail next to the cow\u2019s pen and thought about his life and the murder that landed him here. The symbolism that he had used his hands to end one life and help begin another was not lost on him. \u201cI stayed for six hours,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very beautiful.\u201d The night he killed his girlfriend, Vala says, he blacked out and then came to with his hands around her neck, after she was dead. \u201cWe never fight,\u201d he said. \u201cWe never do. So I don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d He felt helpless and out of control when he came to.  But now he\u2019s trying to pull it together. He decided to quit drinking for good. And when he\u2019s working with animals, he said, feels a new calm wash over him.  It\u2019s a change the prison guards have noted, too. Sigurd Vedvik said he met Vala while he was serving out the earlier part of his sentence in a high-security prison. Vedvik was screening him for entry into Bastoy. Vala barely could communicate. He seemed broken. \u201cWhen he first came here, he was very afraid of many people,\u201d said Vedvik, who sees himself as more of a teacher or social worker than a person who enforces security.  Now, Vala is making friends. Talking more. Taking responsibility for the cattle he\u2019s tasked with caring for. He strokes the cows\u2019 necks so gently, it seems as if he\u2019s worried they will shatter. When Vala leaves Bastoy, he plans to go into the construction business and hopes to find some way to spend time on a farm. \u201cI\u2019m trying to think to my future.\u201d That\u2019s something he couldn\u2019t do after the murder. And it took a posh prison \u2013 one with cattle and horses \u2013 to get him into that state of mind. "

        "content": "Fresh from being awarded honorary life membership of the European Tour after his record-breaking 2011, Luke Donald is aiming to cap a landmark week by reclaiming the world No.1 spot. The Englishman was handed the accolade after becoming the first player to top both the European Tour and PGA Tours money lists last year. Donald spent a large part of last season at the top of the rankings, hitting the front after defeating compatriot Lee Westwood in a playoff at the BMW PGA Championship. And as he prepares to launch the defense of his crown at English course Wentworth this week, Donald has underlined his desire to usurp Northern Ireland\u2019s Rory McIlroy at the top of the rankings. Tiger\u2019s niece Cheyenne Woods turns professional \u201cI\u2019m excited to be here, and glad to have a chance to go back to number one,\u201d he was quoted as saying on the European Tour\u2019s official website. \u201cIt\u2019s always a great week, and especially when you have a weather forecast like this. I\u2019m excited to be back here.  \u201cI\u2019ve performed well around this golf course and I think any time you\u2019re coming back to a place with such good memories, you feel good about it.\u201d Donald has performed well at Wentworth after changes were made to the course two years ago and he says last year\u2019s triumph over Westwood provided one of the highlights of his career so far. He added: \u201cIt was a huge win for me, in terms of cementing the win that I had a few months earlier in the Accenture Match Play. \u201cTo come here and win a stroke play event against a very strong field in the The European Tour\u2019s Flagship Event was special. \u201cI grew up just down the road, I had watched this tournament many times as a kid. Not just having the win on the line but also the title being Number One golfer in the world was very special. The year kept improving as it went along, and this was a big part of it.\u201d Donald\u2019s stellar 2011 convinced the European Tour to hand him honorary life membership and he becomes the 41st player to achieve the feat. Newly-wed Dufner dreams of Ryder Cup Last year 2011 U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy, 2011 British Open winner Darren Clarke, South Africa\u2019s Charl Schwartzel, who won the 2011 Masters, and Lee Westwood were all awarded the prize. Donald said: \u201cIt is very inspiring what the European Tour has done in the last few years, and it\u2019s nice to be mentioned in the same breath as some of the greats that have played this Tour, and this is very special.  \u201cThis means a lot, and I really thank you for it.\u201d The European Tour\u2019s chief executive George O\u2019Grady said Donald\u2019s achievements in 2011, where he won record earnings of \u20ac5,323,400 ($6,701,800) were quite extraordinary.  He said: \u201cTo reach the number one position in the world last May in such dramatic circumstances at Wentworth was one thing, but to follow that up with another superb victory in the Scottish Open on his way to winning The Race to Dubai and the US PGA Tour Money List was deeply impressive. \u201cLuke\u2019s record in 2011 speaks volumes for his consistent high standard of play during the whole year and it is a great privilege to honour him in this very special way with this Honorary Life Membership, the highest award we as a Tour can bestow.\u201d"

        "content": "David Villa was top goalscorer at Euro 2008 as Spain secured a first major championship in 44 years, but the world champions\u2019 all-time leading marksman will not be part of next month\u2019s title defense in Poland and Ukraine. Villa, who has scored 51 international goals, has been out of action since December, when he fractured a bone in his left leg while playing for Barcelona at the FIFA Club World Cup. The Spanish Football Federation\u2019s website has confirmed that the 30-year-old will not be fit enough to be part of coach Vicente del Bosque\u2019s 23-man squad, which will be named on Sunday. Who are European football\u2019s \u2018Most Valuable Players?\u2019 \u201cVilla spoke with the national team coach after the team arrived (for a training camp) in Schruns, Austria,\u201d it reported. \u201cAfter not getting in the final practice and development desired, David Villa spoke with Del Bosque, who relayed that although it was Villa\u2019s wish to be with the team in Poland and Ukraine, that his physical state was \u2018not as good\u2019 as would be desirable.\u201d It is the second setback for Del Bosque, who will also be without injured key defender Carles Puyol for the June 8-July 1 tournament. Villa , who scored five goals as Spain won the 2010 World Cup, expressed his gratitude to fans for their continued backing. \u201cThanks to all of you for your support,\u201d the former Valencia striker wrote on micro-blogging site Twitter. \u201cI will continue working to return to play as soon as possible with Barca and the Spanish national team.\u201d Villa\u2019s absence was felt by Barca, who missed out on the Spanish league title for the first time in four years and finished second \u2013 nine points behind archrivals Real Madrid. With Villa unavailable, the door is now open for Fernando Torres to stake a claim for a return to the starting lineup. The Chelsea striker, who scored the only goal as Spain beat Germany 1-0 in the Euro 2008 final, has been called into the squad for Saturday\u2019s friendly against Serbia. Fernando Llorente, the Athletic Bilbao forward who starred during the Basque club\u2019s run to the Europa League final, is also hoping to lead Spain\u2019s frontline. Four Four Two magazine\u2019s Tim Stannard explained how the absence of Villa, captain Carles Puyol and the loss of form of several key players could mean Joachim Low\u2019s Germany are now favorites for the tournament. \u201cGermany moved into the favorites position, although they do have a very tough group to get through,\u201d said Stannard. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that Puyol is out. Gerard Pique is very much out of form, there are doubts about who is going to play at full back. Iniesta and Pedro aren\u2019t in very good form and neither is Fernando Torres.\u201d Stannard tipped Llorente to fill Villa\u2019s boots, although he will first have to emerge unscathed from Bilbao\u2019s Copa del Rey final against Barcelona on Friday. \u201cThe Copa del Rey final is another huge blitz to Del Bosque at the end of a badly organized campaign so far for Spain,\u201d he said. Drawn in Group C, Spain will first face 2006 World Cup winners Italy in Gdansk on June 10 before playing Croatia and the Republic of Ireland."

        "content": "Russia test-fired a ballistic missile Wednesday, a move that comes amid tensions about a recent NATO announcement that it placed an interim missile defense shield in Europe. The intercontinental missile was launched Wednesday morning from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northwestern Russia, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. \u201cThe new intercontinental ballistic missile is intended to strengthen the capabilities of Russia\u2019s Strategic Missile Forces, including its capabilities for overcoming anti-missile defenses,\u201d Defense Ministry spokesman Vadim Koval  told RIA Novosti. The launch comes days after NATO\u2019s chief said the alliance now has an interim ballistic missile defense capability in Europe.  Among the interim capabilities are missile interceptors loaded on a U.S. ship in the Mediterranean, the first of four anticipated warships with the defense system. A defense radar is also operational in Turkey. The interim system will link the allies\u2019 missile defense systems \u2013 satellites, ships, radars and interceptors \u2013 under NATO control from a U.S. base in Ramstein, Germany. NATO has asked Russia to participate in the system, but negotiations have been deadlocked over Russia\u2019s demand for a legally binding treaty guaranteeing the shield would not be used as a deterrent to Moscow\u2019s own systems. Late last year, then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev threatened to withdraw from the START treaty on nuclear weapons reductions and deploy ballistic missiles in its enclave of Kaliningrad on its border with Europe, if NATO moved ahead with the plans for missile defense. Tensions further increased in December, when Russia\u2019s ambassador to NATO suggested that Moscow would close transit routes that send vital supplies to troops in Afghanistan."

The 21-year-old has signed with the same Excel agency that represents Tiger and announced her intention to turn professional after excelling in the amateur ranks. \u201cI am really looking forward to pursuing my goals and dreams to compete on the highest level,\u201d she said in a statement on the PGA Tour\u2019s website. \u201cAs I begin my professional career, I am confident and excited about working with Excel as they help shape my future, both personally and professionally.\u201d Woods was schooled at Wake Forest in North Carolina and set the record for lowest career scoring average. She was a two-time All-American and three-time All-Atlantic Coast Conference team member. Cheyenne is the daughter of Tiger\u2019s half-brother Earl Dennison Woods Jr. and can boast 30 victories in amateur tournaments.

The Belgian has announced she will bow out in September after the U.S. Open, the setting for three of her four grand slam titles. Clijsters retired in 2007 to give birth to her first daughter, but returned in 2009 to enjoy the most successful period of her career. The 28-year-old added to her first grand slam in 2005 by securing back-to-back titles at the U.S. Open in 2009 and 2010. She then added the 2011 Australian Open to her roll of honor. It was during this period that Clijsters regained the No. 1 ranking for the first time in five years, but since then a series of injuries have disrupted her career. She told a press conference in New York that a swansong in the Big Apple would be a fitting end to her career. \u201cAs it stands I will end my career at the U.S. Open. That is where I enjoyed my greatest triumphs and it is a very special place for me,\u201d she said. \u201cThe stadium is only about 45 minutes away from our house in the United States and my parents-in-law will be able to be present.\u201d Clijsters announced last month she would miss the clay court season after suffering a hip injury at the Miami Open.

        "content": "Manchester City\u2019s English Premier League title came at a staggering cost, with the Abu Dhabi-owned team splashing huge amounts on transfer fees and wages for high-profiles stars like Yaya Toure, Sergio Aguero and David Silva. Whether City\u2019s expensively assembled squad is worth the astronomical wage bill is debatable, but it would seem City\u2019s fans are getting their money\u2019s worth after the English champions topped a \u201cValue League\u201d released this week. The league, compiled by the ING Direct bank, ranks England\u2019s top-flight clubs based on how much fans pay for their season tickets compared to how the team performed during the 2011-12 season and how many goals they scored. And it is City who emerged on top, with the team\u2019s home fans enjoying 18 wins, one draw and 55 goals in the club\u2019s 19 Premier League games at the Etihad Stadium. Who are European football\u2019s \u201cMost Valuable Players?\u201d Just like on the pitch, City beat off competition from neighbors Manchester United, who placed fourth. Second on the list were Wigan Athletic, who, despite flirting with relegation for the majority of the season, provided their fans with more entertainment than their more illustrious rivals. At the other end of the scale, Queens Park Rangers have been ranked as the worst value for money for their fans. Despite escaping relegation to earn a second successive season in the Premier League, QPR \u2013 owned by Lotus F1 chief Tony Fernandes \u2013 offered their fans the worst performances based on the cost of a season ticket at Loftus Road. Brand power: Football\u2019s most valuable clubs unveiled Just above Rangers are Liverpool, who last week dispensed with the services of legendary manager Kenny Dalglish after fans endured the club\u2019s worst Premier League campaign. Supporters gathered in the famous Kop stand at Liverpool\u2019s Anfield stadium saw just six home wins for the Reds during 2011-12, with the five-time European champions finding the net on only 24 occasions. A survey was also conducted to find out what percentage of season ticket-holders in England\u2019s top division would be renewing for the 2012-13 campaign. Out of a sample of over 2,000 fans, 9% said they would not be renewing their season tickets regardless of price, with 7% set to renew if the price does not increase and 13% yet to decide. ING Direct CEO Richard Doe is not surprised a section of fans are questioning the need to attend games given the current economic climate. \u201cFootball fans face the same economic difficulties as everyone else and supporting their team can be a costly outgoing,\u201d Doe said in a press release.  \u201cSo it\u2019s not surprising that many fans are questioning the value for money they\u2019re getting from their club.\u201d Despite facing financial difficulties, Doe said many fans will ultimately renew their season tickets due to the emotional connection they feel to their team. \u201cCome the excitement that the start of the new season brings, it will also be interesting to see how many fans put the love of their club ahead of other financial priorities.\u201d Of the 20 clubs in the Premier League, 12 have frozen or lowered season ticket prices ahead of the new season while five have announced price hikes. The Football Supporters\u2019 Federation (FSF) is a voluntary organization representing fans across Britain. The FSF told CNN that, while ticket prices differ throughout the league, the issue of admission prices is still a pressing one for football fans. \u201cPrices vary from club to club so it\u2019s unfair to put every one in the same category,\u201d said an FSF spokesman. \u201cBut it is fair to say ticket pricing is a major concern for fans.\u201d The FSF went on to explain how ticket pricing and the possible introduction of safe standing areas into football grounds were two issues which fans would like to see addressed. Football stadia in England\u2019s top division are required to be all-seater after the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, when 96 fans lost their lives during an FA Cup semifinal between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. \u201cAlongside fans telling the FSF that they\u2019d like to see the introduction of safe standing areas, and individual complaints relating to policing or stewarding, (ticket pricing) is one of the most frequent topics the FSF receives calls and emails about,\u201d the FSF said.

The German puts his own success down to feeling at home on the course, having lived there. \u201cI lived in Monaco for quite a few years together with my wife,\u201d he explained. \u201cEnjoyed the time, It was a kind of home race for me and I still feel very passionate about going there.\u201d The large sums of money on offer to Formula One\u2019s top drivers means many can afford to base themselves in Monte Carlo, a location with a reputation as a millionaire\u2019s playground. \u201cYou can see the big boats arriving and the small fishing boats getting moved out of the way,\u201d said former McLaren driver David Coulthard. \u201cIt\u2019s the race track that the CEOs want to be at and where all the big parties are held.\u201d Britain\u2019s Coulthard won in Monaco in 2000 and 2002, and he described how being handed the trophy by Monaco\u2019s head of state is one of the biggest honors in F1. \u201cI am really proud to have a picture with Prince Rainier after winning the grand prix knowing that he had sat next to so many of the better drivers than me, the greats of the sport. That\u2019s what makes it so special.\u201d Stirling Moss is widely regarded as one of the finest racers to have never won a world championship. But the Briton, who raced between 1951 and 1961, won at Monaco three times. \u201cI think amongst the drivers they\u2019d like to say they\u2019ve won Monaco, that is the pearl,\u201d said the 82-year-old. And it is a view supported by Moss\u2019s modern counterparts.  Schumacher\u2019s teammate Nico Rosberg enjoyed the first grand prix victory of his career early this season in China, but the German said a win on Sunday would be extra special. \u201cMonaco is the history, the track itself, the atmosphere. It is the highlight of the F1 season,\u201d said the 26-year-old. \u201cIt\u2019s spectacular.\u201d"

        "content": "It\u2019s not just the athletes going for gold in the 2012 London Olympics \u2013 it appears that some of the torch bearers may be trying to cash in on the role of carrying the flame. In the few days since the Olympic flame arrived in Britain several adverts for what are claimed to be genuine Olympic torches have appeared on the online auction site eBay, some with eye-watering price tags. Six torches have sold for more than \u00a3100,000 ($158,000) on eBay, although it\u2019s not known whether money actually changed hands at the end of the auction. One bidder asks if a torch is authentic, and the seller, who lives in Burnham-on-Sea, England, responds: \u201cRunning at 1638 on Monday. It will be dispatched within my handling time. Absolutely authentic, I wouldn\u2019t risk my eBay rating on selling a fake.\u201d After a frenzy of up to 163 bids, the \u201csoot-marked torch\u201d sold for \u00a3153,000 ($241,000).  London Olympics organizers say they cannot be used again as the burner system is disabled after each runner finishes a section. Some sellers say they will donate a percentage of the sale price to charity, with one offering to give 10% to Save the Children. Each of the torches used in the 70-day relay up to the opening ceremony on 27 July has been offered in advance to the runner at a discounted price of just under \u00a3199 ($314)\u2026 or \u00a3215 ($339) if they bought it on the day. Organizers say the money helps to cover the production costs of \u00a3594 ($937) for each of the perforated, aluminum alloy torches. A spokeswoman for the 2012 games said: \u201cThe torches are the torch bearers\u2019 to do what they want with them \u2013 we hope they find a good home.\u201d London Olympic Games organizers are not responsible for the distinctive torches once the runners take ownership, but the spokeswoman urged potential online bidders to be cautious. She advised anyone considering making a bid to check the seller\u2019s identity and then visit the official London 2012 Olympics website which carries a full list of torch bearers. Large crowds have been turning out each day to watch the procession of the Olympic flame through the UK and some have gained a glimpse of a celebrity \u2013 English soccer star and Los Angeles Galaxy player, David Beckham, lit the first torch on its arrival in the UK. And American rapper and Black Eyed Peas star Will.i.am took a turn carrying the flame on Monday.  Organizers say there will be a series of high-profile bearers throughout the relay but are staying tight-lipped about exactly who they are. Apart from celebrities and athletes, most of the runners were chosen in recognition for a contribution to their community or personal achievement and followed a nomination process.  The journey began when the flame was lit from the sun\u2019s rays at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, Greece. The flame will feature at the opening ceremony when the final torch bearer lights the cauldron inside London\u2019s Olympic Stadium. In the interim, it will be carried 8,000 miles across the UK by 8,000 runners and using a route that organizers say will be within 10 miles of 95% of the population.  Five days into the relay, crowds are still turning out in force across the south west of England. \u201cI think it\u2019s fantastic there\u2019s been so much enthusiasm running through each community,\u201d said the London Olympics spokeswoman. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very British thing to do \u2013 to get behind something in your community.\u201d "

        "content": "When Juventus\u2019 long wait for a Serie A crown ended this month, it focused attention on the corruption scandals which have blighted Italian football in recent years. The Turin giants were stripped of the titles won in 2005 and 2006 and relegated to Serie B because of their involvement, along with several other top clubs, in match fixing. The \u201cCalciopoli\u201d affair saw former Juventus managing director Luciano Moggi banned for life by the Italian football authorities, and he is still facing criminal proceedings for sporting fraud. But while those successes were expunged from the record books, Juventus president Andrea Agnelli has told CNN that they still count for everyone involved with the club \u2013 making it 30 Scudettos overall, not 28.  After clinching the title two weeks ago with victory over Atlanta, a sign displaying the number 30 appeared at the entrance to Juve\u2019s new stadium, which has been used for the first time this season. \u201cWell for the official records it\u2019s the 28th, for every single Juventina (Juventus fan) in the world it\u2019s the 30th,\u201d said the 36-year-old Agnelli, the fourth member of the famous family which owns car manufacturer FIAT to take the helm at Juventus. \u201cIt\u2019s a very tough matter, I would say. One of the privileges of managing Juventus is managing people\u2019s dreams and emotions \u2013 in our emotions and our feelings we have 30.\u201d  Three stars controversy Reports in Italy also claim that Juventus players will have three stars embroidered inside their official club badges on shirts to be worn next season. The tradition of depicting a star for every 10 championships won was started by Agnelli\u2019s father Umberto, a legendary former Juventus president. The move could put the club at odds with the Italian football federation (FIGC) at a time when another potential match-fixing scandal has been made public. The FIGC said in a statement last month that nine former Bari players were under investigation for the \u201calleged fixing of nine matches in last season\u2019s Serie A championship.\u201d Former Bari defender Andrea Masiello \u2013 now playing for Atalanta \u2013 was arrested as part of the probe which also implicated eight of his former teammates. In August 2011, former Atalanta captain and Italian international midfielder Cristiano Doni was banned for three and a half years for his part in the \u201cCalcioscommesse\u201d match-fixing and betting scandal involving Serie B matches. It left Atalanta, who were promoted from Serie B, with a six point penalty at the start of this year\u2019s Serie A season. Three stars on their shirts or otherwise, Agnelli, who took over the helm two years ago, is on a mission to restore his club\u2019s reputation as a major force. Statistically the most successful team in Italian football history, Juve also won the European title in 1985 and 1996. Champions League hopes Not content with going unbeaten through the Serie A season under coach Antonio Conte, Agnelli believes the Bianconeri can win the Champions League in their first appearance in the competition since the 2009-10 season. \u201cIt\u2019s never too early,\u201d he said. \u201cJuventus takes part in every single competition with ambitions of winning it.\u201d The only blot on this season\u2019s copybook came in the final match, as an unbeaten 43-game run ended in the Coppa Italia final on Sunday. A 2-0 defeat to Napoli meant disappointment for Juventus legend Alessandro Del Piero in the final match of his 19-year career with the club.  It was a bitter pill to swallow, but Agnelli is philosophical about the defeat. \u201cIf they would have asked me in September, \u2018At the end of the year you win the Scudetto but lose the Coppa Italia final,\u2019 I would have signed a hundred times no question about it, so we\u2019re extremely proud of what we\u2019ve done,\u201d he said.  \u201cI think it\u2019s been an extraordinary result, let\u2019s say we\u2019ve just missed a little topping on the cake and we might leave that for next year.\u201d  Agnelli appointed former Juve player Conte after sacking Luigi Delneri as coach in May 2011 and it proved a master stroke. But Agnelli \u2013 a graduate of Britain\u2019s prestigious Oxford University \u2013 has had to overhaul the team and the club\u2019s commercial operations in order to compete with leading Europe rivals. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of changes,\u201d Agnelli admitted. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve tried to do is to revive the pride of being at Juventus. We\u2019re all extremely proud that we\u2019ve achieved that in only two years.\u201d Star quality Working with Conte, Agnelli has placed the emphasis on youth and players who are on the upward curve in their careers.  \u201cWe might not be full of stars but we\u2019re full of \u201cwannabe\u201d stars.  He cites Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal as an example: \u201cHe is going to become a star \u2013 he\u2019s 24, he\u2019s got over 40 caps for his national team, he can be a star.\u201d But Agnelli also credited his more senior players such as goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, who stayed with the club despite the relegation, and has special praise for retiring fans\u2019 favorite Del Piero. \u201cI think Alessandro, as I\u2019ve said many times, will always represent Juventus,\u201d he said.  \u201cHe\u2019s been our captain for 10 years and what a finale \u2013 lifting the trophy, that\u2019s an amazing story. I think we always have to be grateful to him.\u201d"

        "content": "Didier Drogba has confirmed he is leaving Chelsea, a decision which means the striker\u2019s last kick of a ball for the English club will be the penalty that sealed a first European Champions League crown on Saturday. The Ivory Coast forward scored the decisive spot kick as Chelsea defeated Bayern Munich to secure club football\u2019s most coveted trophy, but he is to seek pastures new when his contract expires in June. The 34-year-old has scored 157 goals in 341 appearances since he signed for the west London club from French side Marseille back in 2004 and he has been linked with a big-money move to China. He told Chelsea\u2019s official website: \u201cI wanted to put an end to all the speculation and confirm that I am leaving.  Chelsea win Champions League after shoot out drama in Munich \u201cIt has been a very difficult decision for me to make and I am very proud of what we have achieved but the time is right for a new challenge for me.\u201d Drogba\u2019s eight years at Stamford Bridge have been littered with success. He won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, two League Cups and one European Champions League. He has finished as the Premier League\u2019s top scorer on two occasions and has twice been voted the Players\u2019 Player of the Year. \u201cAs a team we have accomplished so much and have won every single trophy possible,\u201d he added. \u201cSaturday was a very special moment for everyone at the club and for all the fans, and I am very proud to have played my part in bringing many trophies to this club, which has been my home for the last eight years. \u201cI would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at the club especially (Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich) and my teammates, many of whom have become very close friends and will be my friends for life. CNN blog: Fading Chelsea bury Bayern\u2019s dream \u201cI would also like to say a very special thank you to the Chelsea fans who have shown me so much love and support over the years. I wish the club all the best and continued success for the future \u2013 you will always be in my heart.\u201d Drogba was signed by Jose Mourinho, who now coaches Spanish giants Real Madrid, and has spearheaded Chelsea\u2019s front line for the best part of a decade. He has the reputation of being a big-game player and has scored nine goals in cup final matches for Chelsea. Drogba opened talks last year about extending his contract but the two parties could not reach an agreement. Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay said that Drogba will always be a part of the club\u2019s family. \u201cHe is certainly leaving on a high after Saturday night but he feels the time is right for a new challenge,\u201d Gourlay told the club\u2019s website. Jubilant Chelsea parade Champions League trophy \u201cHe has been a consummate professional during his entire time here and as one of the natural leaders in our squad he has been an inspiration to a lot of our younger players. \u201cWe have known for some time that this outcome was likely but Didier and the club only made a final decision on that in the last couple of days, because for obvious reasons neither Didier nor the club wanted to distract focus away from the Champions League Final.\u201d Speculation in recent days has linked Drogba with a move to China and a reunion with former Chelsea striking partner Nicolas Anelka, who is now player-manager of Shanghai Shenhua.

        "content": "Bayern Munich might be licking their wounds after defeat in the European Champions League final, but the German club can find comfort in victory of a different kind: by beating Chelsea in football\u2019s financial league table.  Despite Saturday\u2019s crushing penalty shootout loss to the English side in their own backyard at the the Allianz Arena, the Bavarians have been ranked as the second most valuable brand in football. According to a new report by independent consultancy Brand Finance, which has compiled a list of the 50 biggest brands in the sport, the four-time European champions have been valued at $786 million. Chelsea, by comparison, made fifth place with a value of $398 million. But English giants Manchester United lead the way, as in 2011, with a brand estimated to be worth $853 million. \u201cManchester United have got a global reach,\u201d Brand Finance\u2019s head of sports brands Dave Chattaway told CNN.  Click here to see football\u2019s top 10 brands \u201cUnited have got quite a professional setup, with people who have worked for Pepsi, Disney, all different kinds of marketing industries. They have brought their expertise into the sports industry.\u201d But Bayern are the year\u2019s big winners. Despite the defeat by Chelsea and having been beaten to the German league and cup by Borussia Dortmund, the club\u2019s brand value grew by 59% over the last 12 months. \u201cIf you look at Bayern Munich, they are a domestic powerhouse,\u201d said Chattaway.  \u201cThey have got really strong links with strong German brands. \u201cBayern have long-term deals, they have been with Adidas for over 10 years. They generate the highest commercial revenue and they are able to negotiate the highest possible deals based on their dominance of the German market.\u201d Munich mourns as Bayern blow big chance Behind United and Bayern are the Spanish \u201cEl Clasico\u201d rivals of Real Madrid, third with a value of $600 million, and Barcelona, with a brand worth $580 million. Spanish champions Real and 2011 European champions Barca have seen similar decreases in the value of their brands, 7% and 8% respectively, which Chattaway puts down to the country\u2019s current economic plight. \u201cThey have both had relatively successful years on the pitch,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe eurozone crisis has really impacted the capital in Spain and Italy. It\u2019s not necessarily something they are doing wrong commercially, it\u2019s a sign of the economy they operate in.\u201d The top 10 is dominated by teams from the English Premier League, with United and Chelsea followed by 2011-12 title winners Manchester City in eighth ($302 million) Torres unsure of Chelsea future \u201cWithin Europe, the Premier League is still the pinnacle,\u201d explained Chattaway.  \u201cIt still generates the most money because of the broadcast rights. \u201cIt is much more attractive to a foreign audience than the German Bundesliga or the Spanish First Division. The Premier League clubs are benefiting from that.\u201d Italian Cup winners Napoli ($85 million) were the only Serie A  club to increase brand value, coming off the back of a relatively successful Champions League campaign, to be 22nd overall. AC Milan ($292 million) placed ninth on the list after winning the title in 2010-11, while this season\u2019s champions Juventus ($160 million) fell from 10th in 2011 to 16th this year. Former England captain David Beckham and his Los Angeles Galaxy teammates enjoyed a landmark year in 2011, being crowned Major League Soccer champions for a third time. Despite their success, and despite boasting one of football\u2019s most recognizable and marketable stars, the Galaxy ($46 million) only crept onto the list in 50th position. \u201cThe game in the U.S. is still developing massively,\u201d said Chattaway.  \u201cThe revenues are a fraction of those in Europe. The games are rarely sold out and the grounds themselves have quite a small capacity. \u201cThe commercial deals in the U.S. cannot compete with the European market. The MLS is still largely only shown in the U.S., it hasn\u2019t really expanded globally as quickly as we would have expected.\u201d With such a huge gap between the sport\u2019s most lucrative brands and those with less commercial appeal, are football clubs making the most of their financial potential? \u201cI think there is more scope for all the clubs to further maximize value \u2013 clubs have traditionally been slow and unimaginative in monetizing the brand they own,\u201d Chattaway said. \u201cThere is scope for football clubs to learn from U.S. sports marketing practices. \u201cThe clubs need to better understand the brand asset that they own so that they can ensure they get the right returns on all commercial deals.\u201d The list took into account various revenue streams for clubs, such as ticket sales, merchandising, sponsorship deals and money received from the sale of broadcasting rights. ."

        "content": "Be prepared, the next big thing facing a green makeover might just be your closet. The glitzy world of fashion and design doesn\u2019t typically conjure up images of sustainability and social consciousness, but if its up to Eva Kruse, CEO of the Danish Fashion Institute and Chairman of the Nordic Fashion Association, that\u2019s all going to change. In the last month, she has pulled off the largest sustainable fashion summit in the world, and starting this week, she is launching a global social media campaign, aiming to forever change the way we look at our clothes. Her goal is for all companies in the industry to declare sustainability a key value. \u201cI have worked in the fashion industry for nearly 20 years, and it is a wonderful and exciting industry, but it is also one of the largest and most polluting in the world,\u201d said Kruse.  From the massive consumption of water and fertilizer in cotton production, to the chemical processing at plants, the pollution of local waterways and environments, safety issues for workers, fair wages, child labor and other social concerns \u2013 issues for the fashion industry are enormous, she says. \u201cThat is why it is so important that we address this \u2026 and because of the size of the industry, even a small change can make a big difference,\u201d says Kruse.  Kruse, who founded the Danish Fashion Institute as the only employee in 2005, is credited by industry professionals and government ministers for having put Danish design and sustainable fashion on the world map. Last month, she gathered more than 1,000 people \u2013 including Hollywood celebrities, international designers and other industry professionals \u2013 at the Copenhagen Fashion Summit, to explore sustainable solutions. The culmination was a suggested Code of Conduct for the Fashion and Textile industry, created in conjunction with the United Nations, and to be presented alongside the Rio+20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Brazil in June.  \u201cIt aims to drill into the supply chain,\u201d says Soren Mandrup Petersen, Head of Partnerships and Local Networks at U.N. Global Compact, \u201cand if the sector responds, it will have a tremendous impact.\u201d  \u201cThere is a movement underway,\u201d says Kruse. \u201cIt is happening, and we can help shed light on it.\u201d That is also the goal of her latest venture launching this week \u2013 an online campaign called NICE, or the Nordic Initiative, Clean and Ethical. It aims to have the industry join forces around change, and to educate consumers to make conscious choices.  \u201cThe entire field is so heavily knowledge based that it makes it difficult for companies to get started. The key is to make \u2026 knowledge accessible and to create networks, because there are solutions.\u201d She says new and sustainable fashions are already being made from innovative textiles such as milk fibers, corn, and bamboo. Among those leading the charge are companies like Swedish chain store H&M with their Conscious Collection, Patagonia, Danish design house Trash-Couture, and the PPR Group with brands like Gucci, Stella McCartney, Alexander McQueen and Puma. H&M\u2019s head of sustainability, Helena Helmersson says this is the future. \u201cCustomers are becoming more and more aware and want transparency, which makes companies improve their sustainability performance and make more sustainable products.\u201d And, she says, \u201cas a big player we can help drive demand.\u201d At Trash-Couture, which boasts a massive list of celebrity clients like Penelope Cruz, Rachel Weisz, Kirsten Dunst, Celine Dion and many others \u2013 ethical fashion and the way they reuse, redesign, respin, and recycle leftover fabric from their own collection and that of other design houses is part of the design. \u201cAs pioneers we feel we have helped set the agenda on an issue that is about much more than just fashion,\u201d says managing director, Nanna Lowe. \u201cThis way, fashion suddenly gets new meaning, becoming a statement, a value, an act.\u201d Kruse agrees, saying it has the potential to push other industries with it, by making it look smart to consider your choices. \u201cIf all the big brands and strong designers care \u2013 and show and tell that they care \u2013 then people could also begin to think differently about how they spend their money. Her goal: \u201cTo have people join forces to help us change the world.\u201d And to her, that change starts in our closets.  But don\u2019t worry, she says, \u201cthe aim isn\u2019t for all of us to start wearing brown. Sustainable fashion can be equally sexy, desirable and fantastic in every way. The aim is to create the brilliance with less impact on people and our planet.\u201d "

The Spaniard won 7-5, 6-4 to help erase painful memories from last year\u2019s final when Nadal again faced Djokovic only for the Serb to come out on top.  The victory also ends a run of seven defeats for Nadal against Djokovic.  \u201cWinning is important, when  you lose you play with doubts,\u201d Nadal told AFP after the match. \u201cThis was an important match. I will put this trophy in my bedroom.

But after eight  years being in the top two, it is no big difference,\u201d Nadal added. \u201cIt\u2019s normal for the rankings to change in the around Roland Garros or  Wimbledon. I\u2019m a few points from Roger. I\u2019m happy about everything.\u201d Meanwhile world number one Djokovic must pick himself up after a frustrating display in Rome.  A dubious line call essentially cost him the first set whilst the Serb had six opportunities to break Nadal in the second set, only to fade and finally hand his rival the title with a double fault. \u201cHe is always the favorite, even if I win against him seven times; he is the best player in the world on this surface,\u201d Djokovic told the ATP\u2019s official website after his loss. \u201cI think that the match today was quite close, even if he won in straight sets.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t use the opportunities against Rafa he gets momentum. I made a lot of errors which should not happen when you play against Nadal. I will go to Paris with confidence and I played a great week.\u201d The French Open begins at Roland Garros Tuesday.    "

Although a moderate rain fell on the area Monday, the local weather forecast called for partly cloudy skies and dry conditions to prevail by Tuesday. In Finale Emilia, about 35 kilometers (21 miles) north of Bologna, 75 people were sleeping in cars in a public park. One of them was Filomenna Gatti, who planned to cram into a Fiat Punto with her husband and three children under 6. \u201cI close my eyes and I see stones falling and I feel the ground shaking when it\u2019s still,\u201d Gatti said as she walked her dog. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in any building.\u201d Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti was expected to return from the NATO summit in Chicago on Monday.  Monti said Sunday he was leaving the conference early, vowing, \u201cAll that is necessary will be done as soon as possible\u201d to help the survivors. The quake was centered about 4 kilometers outside Camposanto, northwest of Bologna,  the U.S. Geological Survey reported. In addition to the seven reported fatalities, 50 people were injured in the quake, Gabrielli said.  iReport: Watch the earthquake aftermath unfold  The stricken region is part of Italy\u2019s industrial heartland, and the dead included two people killed in a ceramics factory in Sant\u2019Agostino di Ferrara, about 30 kilometers from the epicenter, civil protection agency spokeswoman Elisabetta Maffani said.  Workers were still digging through rubble in hopes of finding survivors in Sant\u2019Agostino, where the quake knocked down a church bell and a magnitude-4.8 aftershock brought down part of its city hall Sunday evening.  \u201cWe have just lost our history. Four generations of my family lived here, and now it\u2019s gone,\u201d 72-year-old Luciano Frendo said as he walked through Finale Emila. \u201cOur history has collapsed.\u201d The civil protection agency said it expects to get more reports of injuries as rescue workers make their way to remote villages in the mountainous area. Heavy rain was expected to continue into Tuesday after hampering rescue efforts and efforts to spot survivors from the air.  Other deaths included one person killed when a work shed collapsed in nearby Ponte Rodoni di Bondeno, Maffani said. In addition, a woman in Bologna died of a heart attack during an evacuation, a Moroccan national died when the factory he was working in collapsed and a sixth victim was found dead under rubble in Sant\u2019Agostino, she said. The body of a seventh victim was located under a collapsed house, according to Alessio Bellodi of the civil protection branch in Bologna. The same area was struck by a 5.3-magnitude quake in January. And a 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck near the central Italian city of L\u2019Aquila, more than 400 km to the south, in 2009, killing more than 300 and causing widespread destruction."

        "content": "In just over three weeks, Jason Dufner has won his first two PGA Tour titles and got married. As the new leader of the FedEx Cup series, the American has catapulted himself into the top-15 of the world rankings and is considered a real contender to win his first major at next month\u2019s U.S. Open. But what he really wants is a spot in Davis Love\u2019s Ryder Cup squad come September as the U.S. team seeks to avenge the 2010 defeat by Europe. \u201cI hope it gets Davis Love\u2019s attention. I think I will be No. 1 in the points, so I hope that gets his attention,\u201d Dufner told reporters after sinking a final-hole birdie to avoid a playoff at the Byron Nelson Championship on Sunday. \u201cObviously being a Ryder Cup year, that would be special to have on your resume and play in, even if it\u2019s only for one time. That was one of my main goals. The FedEx Cup, being No. 1 is a great position to be in, but we\u2019re maybe a little more than halfway through, so we have a long haul on that.\u201d Having been winless for 163 PGA Tour starts, Dufner finally broke his duck in New Orleans at the end of last month when he beat three-time major winner Ernie Els in a playoff to claim the $1.15 million first prize at the Zurich Classic. The 35-year-old then wed his partner Amanda, had his honeymoon at last week\u2019s Players Championship in Florida and took home another $1.17 million in Texas on Sunday as he denied fellow Alabama resident Dicky Pride the chance to claim his second title 18 years after his first \u2013 which would have been a record gap. \u201cAll these things that come with winning are great but I don\u2019t think much about \u2018em, other than the Ryder Cup and trying to win tournaments,\u201d Dufner said. \u201cYou probably couldn\u2019t dream it any better than what\u2019s been going on here. The wedding has been in the works for close to a year so \u2013 I guess I proposed in July \u2013 but to win two events and get married in the span of 22 days, it\u2019s pretty remarkable.  \u201cAmanda and I are lucky to be in the position we\u2019re in and to have each other and enjoy what\u2019s going on around us right now.\u201d Last year Dufner was twice denied his maiden victory in playoffs, the latter coming in the PGA Championship as Keegan Bradley claimed his first major, but he insists he never lost faith that the breakthrough would come. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how fine the line is between winning. Sometimes that can be a hard pill to swallow, but when I\u2019ve been on the other side of it, I always took encouragement from it, that I was playing great golf, and my time was going to come,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it really just propelled me this offseason. I played some events overseas where I played well, and I was thinking coming into the beginning of this year that I could play some really good golf. It\u2019s time to win some events out here.  \u201cI feel comfortable on the golf course when I\u2019m out there. I feel like I\u2019m in good control of my game, getting better emotionally with dealing with the pressures of trying to win out here.\u201d Meanwhile, former U.S. Ryder Cup player Anthony Kim has no chance of qualifying for this year\u2019s match in Illinois after being ruled out for up to five months with arm injuries. Kim missed the 2010 defeat in Wales after having thumb surgery, and now he faces another long rehabilitation after damaging his right elbow when he hit a rock at the Texas Open as well as suffering from tendinitis in his left forearm. \u201cI\u2019m obviously disappointed because I\u2019ve been fighting to get my game back on the right track and having an injury hold me back is frustrating,\u201d the three-time winner said in a statement on the PGA Tour website.  \u201cI\u2019ve been through this process before, though, and know that you have to put in your work with treatments to get healthy. That will be my focus for the next four or five months so I\u2019m in a position to return healthy towards the end of the year and be fully ready for 2013.\u201d "

        "content": "There is a lot to be said for modesty mixed with self-deprecation when faced with overwhelming odds, but despite his best efforts Louis Nicollin ended up displaying neither of these fine qualities. Last November, when the president and owner of Montpellier \u2013 an unglamorous, unfancied, mid-table team that had shocked itself by leading the French league despite never having troubled the upper echelons before \u2013 was asked about the prospects of his team staying the course, he was incredulous to say the least. \u201cMontpellier champions? Impossible,\u201d scoffed Nicollin, who made his money in the refuse industry, in an interview with French sports daily newspaper L\u2019Equipe. \u201cIf I were at PSG (Paris St. Germain), Lyon, Lille or Rennes, and Montpelier finished as champions, I\u2019d want to stab myself in the backside with a sausage.  \u201cWhat a disgrace that would be!\u201d Last weekend Nicollin\u2019s \u201cdisgrace\u201d was complete.  His Montpellier players were crowned champions of France after a 2-1 victory over Auxerre, fending off PSG \u2013 now one of the richest teams in the world after being bought out by the Qatar Investment Authority \u2013 to secure the club\u2019s first ever league title. The victory was remarkable for a number of reasons. For one, Montpellier had never come close to threatening the dominance enjoyed by the likes of Lyon, Marseille or PSG. The last time the club enjoyed any silverware was the French cup 22 years ago.  The team was also purchased on a shoestring budget. While PSG could afford to blow \u20ac40 million ($51.26 million) on Argentine playmaker Javier Pastore and hire Italian legend Carlo Ancelotti, the biggest outlay by Montpellier\u2019s former France under 21 coach Rene Girard was \u20ac2 million ($2.56 million) for defender Henri Bedmino.  \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d midfielder Younes Belhanda told CNN after the game. \u201cI think they will stay here until tomorrow night! It\u2019s good for us, the fans, the president and the city of Montpellier. We are happy. We came from the academy and we win the league with a low earning club.\u201d Montpellier\u2019s entire budget \u2013  \u20ac33 million ($42.29 million) \u2013 was less than Pastore\u2019s transfer fee.  Given their title odds of 80-1 at the start of the season, with a team of journeyman players, no one gave Montpellier a chance. But a 2-2 draw with PSG \u2013 expected to sweep all before them thanks to the club\u2019s Middle Eastern money \u2013 at the start of the year changed the complexion of the title race.  The team\u2019s success \u2013 much like European football\u2019s other fairytale league success, for Hapoel Ironi Kiryat Shmona in Israel \u2013 was built not on money but on nurturing young players in the academy, building team spirit and spotting talent and value in footballers previously discarded by everyone else. \u201cThere is an opportunity (in France) for small, well-run clubs (to do well),\u201d said French football analyst James Eastham, who explained that France has had four different champions in four seasons, which gives opportunities to less well off teams. \u201cMontpellier have had the same president for decades, invested in youth and haven\u2019t spent a lot.\u201d Take John Utaka, the Nigerian who scored the winning goals against Auxerre. He had experienced such a disastrous spell at Portsmouth that no club in England wanted to touch him.  France-born Moroccan playmaker Younes Belhanda, the outstanding player in this Montpellier side, has been with the team since he was 13 years old.  Striker Olivier Giroud worked his way up through the lower leagues before Montpellier saw him playing for second division Tours. He cost \u20ac2million. This season he was the top scorer in the French league. Yet despite the incredulity of the president, the team continued to win until \u2013 like in the English Premier League and Italy\u2019s Serie A \u2013 the title race came down to the last game of the season. But still Nicollin didn\u2019t entirely believe. He instead offered to have his hair cut in a B.A. Baracus-style mohawk if his team won the title. Sure enough Montpellier passed the final test and Nicollin celebrated by having a drastic new hair cut: a mohawk sprayed orange and blue, the club\u2019s colors.  Nicollin is 68 years old.  \u201cWe had to be strong mentally and to stay focus,\u201d striker Giroud told CNN.  \u201cThe game wasn\u2019t easy. We stayed in the game and thanks to John (Utaka) we won. Everybody made a contribution this season. It\u2019s the title for a team, a squad and a region.\u201d Yet the \u201cimpossible,\u201d as Nicollin had claimed, had become possible. Not only that, the success of Montpellier \u2013 a team described as French football\u2019s \u201cugly ducklings\u201d by coach Girard \u2013 in one of Europe\u2019s top leagues gives hope that in the era of big money in football even the smaller teams have a shot at the biggest prizes. Some think this will be the last time an unfancied team could hope to win the league, given PSG\u2019s unlimited funds. But even PSG took notice of the way that Montpellier operated.      \u201cThere were a lot of changes, players and coach. It is not easy to shape a team\u2019s identity,\u201d Ancelotti told Reuters of the upheaval at PSG since his arrival last year. But he was magnanimous in defeat, vowing to follow the blueprint set by the team that shocked France. \u201cWe must look for continuity. There will be no revolution \u2026 Montpellier won the title thanks to a style of football they had been building for years.\u201d"

        "content": "Chelsea spent the weekend celebrating a first European Champions League triumph after a dramatic defeat of Bayern Munich, but the English club\u2019s record signing Fernando Torres was far from happy for the majority of Saturday\u2019s historic win. The Spaniard was left out of the starting lineup for the clash at the German team\u2019s Allianz Arena, with Chelsea\u2019s interim coach Roberto di Matteo deciding to play Ivory Coast forward Didier Drogba alone in attack. Di Matteo\u2019s decision paid dividends, as Drogba scored Chelsea\u2019s 89th-minute equalizer in the 1-1 draw before converting the winning penalty in a nail-biting shootout. Torres, who has struggled for form since joining Chelsea from Liverpool in a British-record $80 million deal in January 2011, described being on the bench for European club football\u2019s most important match as \u201cperhaps the biggest disappointment in my life.\u201d Munich mourns as Bayern blow big chance \u201cI thought I would play in this game and I couldn\u2019t imagine not doing so,\u201d the 28-year-old, who was introduced as an 82nd-minute substitute once Bayern had taken a 1-0 lead through Thomas Muller, told Spanish journalist Guillem Balague.  \u201cBut in the end I could participate and offer the team something. I\u2019m really happy.\u201d Torres scored just six league goals last season, although he did enjoy a productive end of the campaign after netting a hat-trick against Queens Park Rangers and the decisive goal in Chelsea\u2019s Champions League semifinal victory over Barcelona. Despite Torres\u2019 important contribution at Barca\u2019s Camp Nou stadium, Drogba has been Di Matteo\u2019s preferred striker in Chelsea\u2019s recent important matches. Jubilant Chelsea parade Champions League trophy Torres was also on the bench for the London club\u2019s English FA Cup final win over his former club Liverpool. \u201cThere have been a lot of ups and downs,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been many times when I\u2019ve felt lost, I was not sure what to do. I felt like I didn\u2019t know where I belonged. \u201cThis season I have felt things that I never had before. I\u2019ve felt like they treated me in a way that I didn\u2019t expect, not in the way that was spoken of when they signed me.   \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of talks and we\u2019ll talk about my future at the end of the season because the role I\u2019ve had this season is not for me, nor is it the one I expected to play when I came here. I\u2019m not comfortable.\u201d The next goal for Torres is to be included in Spain\u2019s squad for the forthcoming European Championships in Poland and Ukraine, with coach Vicente del Bosque set to name his 23-man squad on May 27. Torres scored the winning goal as Spain beat Germany in the final of the 2008 tournament in Austria and Switzerland, but his inability to cement a place in Chelsea\u2019s team has cast doubt over his international future. The former Atletico Madrid striker has been included in the world champion\u2019s squad for the upcoming friendly matches against Serbia and South Korea, along with Chelsea teammate Juan Mata. \u201cI\u2019ll be hoping to be on the list when it is announced,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel better than ever, hungrier than ever, but that\u2019s what football is like \u2013 often, when you feel you\u2019re at your best they don\u2019t consider you.\u201d Meanwhile, Saturday\u2019s final attracted the attention of some very powerful spectators across the Atlantic. At a G8 summit at Camp David in Maryland, U.S. President Barack Obama took in the action alongside British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. It was Cameron who ended the match the happier, but the two European leaders were able to embrace at the climax of a thrilling final. "

        "content": "French prosecutors have widened an investigation into former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn\u2019s alleged participation in a prostitution ring. Authorities said Monday that Lille police will open a preliminary inquiry into acts that allegedly took place in Washington, which they believe could constitute gang rape.  \u201cFollowing the decision by the examining magistrates, who are in charge of the affair known as the \u2018Carlton affair,\u2019 they have reason to believe \u2026 pertaining to events which allegedly took place in Washington between December 15 and 18, 2010, that there is suspicion of gang rape,\u201d a statement from the Lille prosecutor\u2019s office said.  Strauss-Kahn\u2019s attorneys issued a statement saying, \u201cThe investigation will establish that Dominique Strauss-Kahn has never committed acts of violence or had any relationship whatsoever without the consent of his partners.\u201d Strauss-Kahn: A reputation battered by sex allegations The French newspaper Liberation reported earlier this month that the allegations stemmed from statements made by two women it describes as \u201cescort girls,\u201d who were interviewed by Belgian police as part of an investigation into a prostitution ring run out of the Carlton Hotel in Lille, near France\u2019s border with Belgium.  According to the newspaper\u2019s account of the depositions, the women said they had accompanied two associates of Strauss-Kahn on a visit to Washington, where they had stayed at the W Hotel.  One of them alleged that Strauss-Kahn had used force against her during a sexual encounter at the hotel, despite her protests.  The newspaper did not specify how it obtained the statements. CNN could not independently confirm the report.  The Metropolitan Police Department in Washington said no sexual assault at the hotel was reported at that time. French law allows authorities to prosecute a French national for a crime committed abroad. In a statement to Agence France Presse, Strauss-Kahn\u2019s attorneys Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Baulieu, Richard Malka and Henri Leclerc said the \u201cdeclarations made by these young women are contradictory.\u201d  It also said the women\u2019s testimony was disclosed at an \u201copportune time,\u201d just before the final round of the French presidential election.  Strauss-Kahn lawyers fight against prostitutes claim The prostitution investigation continues a string of sexual allegations against Strauss-Kahn. He has not been convicted of a crime. Strauss-Kahn has been formally warned by French authorities that he is under investigation for \u201caggravated pimping\u201d in connection with the prostitution investigation and has been released on 100,000-euro bail. He has pushed back against the accusations, saying he did not know young women at parties he attended were being paid for sex. One of the sex scandals torpedoed his expected run for the French presidency this year. He stepped down from the top job at the International Monetary Fund after the May 2011 incident, in which a New York hotel maid accused him of sexual assault and attempted rape in May. He denied the accusation. Strauss-Kahn countersues maid for at least $1 million  The case ultimately fell apart after prosecutors decided they could not be sure about the credibility of the alleged victim, despite forensic evidence that showed a sexual encounter had occurred. The maid, Nafissatou Diallo, has since launched a civil action against the former IMF chief, alleging a \u201csadistic assault.\u201d This week a judge in New York rejected Strauss-Kahn\u2019s claim of diplomatic immunity. Strauss-Kahn also faced allegations of attempted rape from a young French writer. Tristane Banon filed a complaint, alleging a 2003 attack, though it could not be pursued because of a statute of limitations. He denied the allegations and has since filed a countersuit in France, alleging slander."

The 60-year old defeated incumbent Boris Tadic in Sunday\u2019s election, denying him a third term in office. Nikolic led with 50.21% of the votes, compared to 46.77% for Tadic, according to preliminary results from the country\u2019s electoral commission. Serbia \u201cwill not stray from the European path,\u201d he told supporters in his victory speech, according to Serbia\u2019s B92 network. \u201cSerbia must develop its economy. The things I pointed out during the campaign must be improved. We have to free ourselves of poverty. We must free ourselves of the low birth rates, bribery, corruption and have friends all over the world.\u201d Rival Tadic congratulated Nikolic on \u201ca fair and well-earned victory,\u201d but warned it would be a \u201ctragic mistake\u201d if Serbia abandoned its move towards membership of the European Union. Under Tadic, Serbia was given EU candidacy status in March but no date has been set for membership talks.  During this time, the Democratic Party leader agreed to hold talks aimed at improving relations with Kosovo, and handed over key war crimes suspects, including Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, to the United Nations tribunal. Both moves were seen as critical to Belgrade\u2019s EU ambitions. Court suspends Ratko Mladic war crimes trial  Nikolic had been the deputy leader of the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS), but broke away in 2008 to form the Serbian Progressive Party after ditching his anti-EU stance. \u201cWe want to join the EU. It has projects, jobs and investments for us,\u201d he once told an election rally, according to Agence France-Presse. Nikolic will now turn his attention to negotiations with rival parties to form a coalition government in the economically depressed country, with the Socialist party under Ivica Dacic seen as kingmakers in this process. The Socialists and Democrats, partners in the outgoing government, reached an agreement to form a pro-European alliance after the May 6 parliamentary elections. Dacic told reporters Sunday that the presidential election result would not change that agreement. In theory, this could see the Democrats retain power in a repeat governing coalition with the Socialists. But Nikolic has the power to give the mandate to form a government to the largest party, which is his own. One man who won\u2019t be part of this process is Tadic. The outgoing president has ruled himself out as prime minister if the Democrats remain in office. "

        "content": "A small Polish wild horse that was used in Nazi experiments during the 1930s has become the center of wetland regeneration efforts across parts of Europe. The rare Konik breed is one of Poland\u2019s least known ecological exports and is believed to be descended from the Tarpan; a prehistoric horse that roamed wild in Europe until the end of the 19th century and whose last known individual died in a Russian zoo in 1909.   Marek Borkowski, President of the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest Trust, says the group\u2019s breeding program has helped to stock reserves in Britain, France, Germany and the Netherlands with small herds that graze on the woody stems of invasive bushes allowing indigenous growth to re-establish itself \u2013 sometimes after decades and even centuries of agricultural use. \u201cOnce farming stopped in these marshlands, bush began to grow, which limits the habitat for many marshland birds that need the open space,\u201d says Borkowski. \u201cThe horses graze on the bark and seedlings of these bushes, which limits its growth, allowing the marshland to survive.\u201d Borkowski says that the horses mirror the natural fauna that would have roamed the area in prehistoric times, helping to return land to its pristine condition. \u201cThey are the closest breed to the original wild horse of Europe \u2013 the type we see painted on caves in Spain and France 20,000 years ago,\u201d he says.  \u201cBut because of Neolithic farming they were pushed out of most Europe except for small pockets in Poland, Russia and the Ukraine.\u201d  Send in your photos from Poland In one of the strangest stories of pre-war Poland, the Konik came to the attention of biologists in the 1930s who saw that horses in the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest in Poland retained certain features of the Tarpan. Polish biologist Tadeusz Vetulani noticed that semi-wild horses used by peasants in Bialowieza Forest displayed the Tarpan\u2019s mousey dun color, their coats turning to white in winter, another Tarpan characteristic. While many regard America\u2019s mustang or the Australian brumby as a wild horse, zoologists say that strictly speaking these are really feral domesticated horses. Vetulani launched a re-breeding program, mating horses with strong Tarpan-like characteristics, in an attempt to regain the lost breed of horse. At the same time, the breed came to the attention of Lutz Heck, the director of Berlin Zoo who, along with his brother Heinz, the head of the Munich Zoo, began a re-breeding program. Heck was a committed Nazi and zoologist whose efforts to \u201cre-breed\u201d extinct species such as the prehistoric ancestor to the modern cow the Aurochs, received support from senior Nazis such as Hermann Goering.  While the re-breeding of extinct species by mating animals of similar characteristics is regarded as impossible by modern science, the Nazis experimented with a program aimed at resurrecting prehistoric animals that reflected Nazi claims to racial purity. When the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939, many of the horses in the breeding program of Vetulani were stolen and brought to Germany.  The horses met a grisly end, most probably eaten by a hungry populace, along with many of the animals in Berlin and Munich zoos, in the closing stages of the Second World War. \u201cThe best animals were taken to Germany and we don\u2019t know exactly what happened to them. It was only after the Second World War we started from scratch again,\u201d says Borkowski.  \u201cThe Nazis didn\u2019t take all the animals,\u201d he says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know the war would end the way it ended so they only took the best specimens. Later, well of course, they were busy with other things so there were still some horses left.\u201d  Bison thrive in primeval Polish forests John Wilson, the nature warden for Blean Woods at Kent Wildlife Trust, says the Konik \u2013 first introduced to Britain in 1995 \u2013 has been an instant hit with ecologists and conservationists. \u201cWe\u2019ve currently got them on the site of an old dairy; land which we say has been \u2018agriculturally improved\u2019 with herbicide or fertilizers,\u201d he says. \u201cThat lush green grass, however, makes it more difficult for the rarer, more specialized plants to flourish and eventually they disappear.\u201d The Konik are perfectly adapted to a variety of harsh environments, from wetlands to open forests, requiring little veterinary care for problems such as hoof rot that might afflict other horse breeds in similarly wet conditions. The grazing is introduced to take the nutrients out of the ground to take it back to a state where it\u2019s unimproved,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cThat takes a lot of time and a lot of grazing.\u201d  Green hay from sites where indigenous plants grow is then spread on the site after grazing in the hope that some of the native species will establish themselves in the soil. The horses breed well and flourish without the need for the kind of intervention that so fascinated Nazi scientists, says Wilson. \u201cThe Nazis were very interested in the whole idea of racial purity,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt seems it didn\u2019t just extend to human being, but to beasts as well.\u201d"

The big-hitting Belgian, who was watched by European captain Jose Maria Olazabal, moved close to the automatic qualifying places for the Ryder Cup with the victory, which also earned him \u20ac700,000 ($900,000). \u201cIt means everything,\u201d the 29-year-old said after his second European Tour victory. Colsaerts was ahead on four occasions in increasingly windy conditions at Finca Cortesin but McDowell kept coming back. The Northern Irishman twice closed the gap to one shot after the turn, the second time when Colsaerts three-putted on the 17th green. But the Belgian, who has a 316-yard average off the tee, held on for a second nerve-wracking win of the day after earlier winning his semifinal against Paul Lawrie on the second extra hole. \u201cTwo days ago I was in my room taking a nap thinking I was going to fly home. It means so much to be here, it\u2019s fantastic,\u201d Colsaerts said. McDowell reached the final by beating Rafael Cabrera Bello on the final hole but remains without a title since his U.S. Open win in June 2010. Colsaerts failed to win either group game, advancing only after a playoff with Charl Schwartzel, and looked a long shot to even make it to the final when he lost the first four holes against a resurgent Lawrie in their semifinal. But the Scot found the bushes with his second shot at the eighth, and he lost two holes in a row to reach the turn only two ahead. Colsaerts seized his chance with birdies on the 13th and 14th to draw level, before winning on the second extra hole. \u201cI could see Paul was not very happy - he wanted the match to finish a little earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cI was probably feeling a lot better than he did and I thought I was going to capitalize on that.\u201d McDowell also made a strong start to his semifinal, winning three of the first holes against Cabrera Bello, but the Spaniard had a chance to level on the 17th \u2013 only to three-putt and lose the hole."

        "content": "Disbelieving Chelsea fans have been celebrating with their Champions League-winning team in London on a victory parade the day after the club won the trophy for the first time in their history. Chelsea\u2019s squad and temporary manager Roberto di Matteo traveled on two open-top buses, waving blue scarves as they showed off the famous trophy with the \u201cbig ears.\u201d Cheering fans crowded onto the streets and even climbed up trees and lampposts and onto bus stops around southwest London to catch a glimpse of their heroes, including matchwinner Didier Drogba. Chelsea, who overcame Barcelona in the semifinals, were 1-0 down against Bayern Munich with seven minutes remaining at the Allianz Arena, but Drogba conjured an 88th-minute equalizer. The Ivorian striker then scored the winning penalty in the shoot-out with what could be his final kick for Chelsea. The 34-year-old\u2019s contract runs out this summer, and he has been linked with a move to China. It capped a remarkable few months for Chelsea, who sacked Portuguese manager Andre Villas Boas in late March with the team toiling in the Premier League and trailing 3-1 against Napoli after the first leg of their Champions League last 16 match. Under Di Matteo, Chelsea somehow overturned the deficit against Napoli, but a miraculous victory over Barcelona managed to overshadow that. Chelsea looked doomed again after skipper John Terry was sent off early in the second leg and they went 2-1 down on aggregate, but once again the Blues triumphed against the odds \u2013 and repeated the trick against Bayern in the German\u2019s club\u2019s home stadium. The win also guaranteed Chelsea a place in the Champions League next season after missing out via the Premier League by only finishing sixth. Tottenham, who finished fourth in the English league, will have to settle for the Europa League. As the buses came to a halt on Sunday, Terry, who was suspended for the final but lifted the trophy with Frank Lampard, led the players and fans in a chant of \u201cchampions, champions, ole ole ole.\u201d When the microphone was passed to Drogba, he was serenaded by both players and fans with \u201cDidier Drogba, we want you to stay.\u201d Roman Abramovich, the club\u2019s wealthy Russian owner, was also on the parade to witness the celebrations of Drogba, Fernando Torres, Ashley Cole, Petr Cech, Juan Mata, and countless other signings made under his big-spending ownership. Winning the Champions League had been Abramovich\u2019s dream and plenty of managers were fired over their failure to deliver it, but Di Matteo\u2019s future is still far from secure. \u201cWhatever the club decides I will respect, it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d the Italian coach said after the match in Munich. As the Chelsea fans celebrated, the mood in Munich was predictably somber. Once the delirious opposition fans had departed \u2013 an estimated 100,000 Chelsea supporters were in Munich \u2013 the city was left to mourn what most of the German newspapers saw as a desperately unlucky defeat. Sports daily Bild\u2019s headline read: \u201cSchweini, we are crying with you!\u201d Bastian Schweinsteiger, the talisman of the Bayern team who came through the youth system at the club, hit the post with a hesitant penalty in the shoot out. Former Chelsea winger Arjen Robben had missed a chance to wrap it up even before the shoot out when he had a penalty saved by Cech in extra time. Chelsea had one corner in the entire match and scored from it through Drogba. Bayern had 20 corners, and 43 attempts on goal to Chelsea\u2019s nine. \u201cIt\u2019s like a nightmare,\u201d Bayern director of sport Christian  Nerlinger said. \u201cWhen you see how the game played itself out, it\u2019s like a bad film. \u201cThis is frustrating and depressing to digest. This defeat is very  difficult to take.\u201d Munich daily S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung concluded: \u201cHow much bad luck fits into a single football match?\u201d"

Riding his Yamaha flawlessly in the wet conditions, Lorenzo took the lead on the first lap and eventually finished 9.905 seconds clear of Valentino Rossi, who had the consolation of his best finish so far for Ducati. Rossi held off a determined Casey Stoner, who finished third in the week he announced he was quitting the sport at the end of the season. \u201cIt was really difficult to hold concentration today, in the dry it\u2019s complicated but in the wet it\u2019s even more,\u201d Lorenzo said. \u201cThe race feels much longer and you have to remember where the corners are slippery every lap. If you forget one you can crash very easily.\u201d Lorenzo, who won for the second time this season, leads the championship by eight points from Stoner. \u201cI was pretty happy to hold on for a podium today,\u201d Stoner said. \u201cI enjoyed the battle with Valentino at the end, there was clean overtaking and we swapped positions a few times but in the end we knew that Valentino had better pace than us and after he passed there was no way I could stay with him. \u201cWe did everything we could today and to come away with a podium is a good result.\u201d Stoner\u2019s Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa started on pole but ended up fourth, and is now 25 points adrift of Lorenzo. \u201cIn the race I immediately realized it was not my day, not a day to take any risk and it was important to simply reach the best position,\u201d Pedrosa said. Rossi managed to work his way from the third row of the grid to second. The seven-time MotoGP champion overtook Stoner on the final lap to record his best result since joining Ducati in 2011. \u201cI\u2019m really, really happy,\u201d Rossi said. \u201cWe knew we had a special opportunity in the wet today, so I tried to ride perfectly and not throw it away. \u201cIt was a great race and a nice, fun battle with Stoner to the last lap. Now our main goal is to take another step forward and make up some more tenths.\u201d"

        "content": "Relief expressed Sunday at the death of Pan Am 103 bomber Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi by relatives of some of his 270 victims was tempered by still-smoldering anger at his release from prison more than two years ago. \u201cFine. He deserved to die,\u201d said Susan Cohen of Cape May Court House, New Jersey, whose daughter Theodora died in the December 1988 airplane bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. \u201cHe was a mass murderer. I feel no pity around him. He got to die with his family around him. My daughter, at age 20, died a brutal, horrible death.\u201d Al Megrahi was the only person convicted in connection with the bombing. In August 2009, he was released from a Scottish prison on the grounds that he was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer and had only a few months to live. He was sent home to Libya on \u201ccompassionate\u201d grounds, receiving a hero\u2019s welcome at the airport. 2011: Convicted Lockerbie bomber says truth will eventually come out \u201cI think Megrahi exemplified the classic case that no matter how heinous the crime, that justice can be bought,\u201d said Victoria Cummock of Miami, who lost her husband John in the bombing and serves as co-president of the Families of Pan Am 103 group. \u201cHis death is a relief,\u201d Cummock said. \u201cFinally Megrahi will be judged by the highest of authorities \u2013 our maker, his maker.\u201d Barbara Zwynenburg of West Nyack, New York, whose 29-year-old son Mark died aboard the plane, said, \u201cIt\u2019s about time. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s dead.\u201d But she called the deal resulting in al Megrahi\u2019s release \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d \u201cHe was supposed to be ill and was allegedly ready to die,\u201d Zwynenburg said. \u201cHe went home to his family, and our son never came home.\u201d At the time of al Megrahi\u2019s release, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, son of then-Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, told Libyan channel Al Mutawassit that \u201cin all commercial contracts for oil and gas with Britain, (al Megrahi) was always on the negotiating table,\u201d adding that then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair raised al Megrahi\u2019s case each time he visited Libya. 2011: CNN\u2019s Nic Robertson tracks down Lockerbie bomber Blair said that while Libya brought up al Megrahi, no deals were ever made when he was in power to arrange for his release. British authorities rejected that al Megrahi\u2019s release was tied to British business deals with Libya. However, victims\u2019 relatives expressed disbelief. \u201cThat was a disgusting deal that involved oil and money,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cAll of us,\u201d said Cummock, \u201chave been pawns in all of this.\u201d  Bert Ammerman of New Jersey, whose brother Tommy was aboard Pan Am 103, said Sunday he was \u201cpleased\u201d at Megrahi\u2019s death. Megrahi\u2019s 2009 release, he said, was \u201cwhen I was most angry in this 24-year journey.\u201d  Libya agreed in 2003 to pay $2.7 billion in compensation to the families of the bombing victims, though Gadhafi always remained cagey about admitting official Libyan involvement in the bombing. Gadhafi died in October following months of unrest in Libya.  \u201cGadhafi\u2019s death brought me a great deal of, the word is, pleasure,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI was happy when he died because he was the primary villain in this.\u201d Megrahi, she said, was \u201csent to do the job.\u201d Ammerman said Gadhafi\u2019s ouster and death also helped reduce some of his anger at al Megrahi\u2019s release.  \u201cHe was the big fish and Megrahi, as far as I\u2019m concerned, became a minor actor once Gadhafi was killed,\u201d he said. But, he said, the release was \u201ca true act of betrayal by our government and the British government.\u201d He felt the United States didn\u2019t do enough to keep al Megrahi behind bars. The full truth about the bombing may have died with al Megrahi, who never provided details. If Megrahi had not been released, Cohen said, he might have talked when the Gadhafi regime fell.  But Cohen and Ammerman said they believe others still in Libya or former Gadhafi regime officials may also have been complicit in the bombing, and that U.S. and British officials should go into the country and conduct interviews in an effort to find them.  \u201cHe was not the only person taking orders,\u201d Cohen said of al Megrahi. \u201c\u2026 We really do need to know how these terrible things are done and who\u2019s involved in them \u2026 The key is, where do we go from here?\u201d Cummock said she previously met with Blair, who told her the Scottish authorities were the ones who released al Megrahi. And she said in the fall, she met with Mustafa Abdul Jalil, chairman of Libya\u2019s Transitional National Council, who has said he has proof Gadhafi ordered the bombing. After the Gadhafi regime fell last year, U.S. officials renewed their call for al Megrahi\u2019s imprisonment. \u201cOnce there\u2019s a government in place, we will renew our calls that Megrahi, who should never have been released in the first place, be returned to serve the rest of his sentence,\u201d Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in October. However, Cummock said, \u201cI don\u2019t think the U.S. government or the U.K. government has the will to find out the truth about why Pan Am 103 was attacked and hold people involved accountable. We\u2019ve seen (nearly) 24 years of turning the page.\u201d \u201cBoth the Scottish and British governments have not been forthcoming,\u201d said U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, on Sunday. \u201cThe whole deal (regarding al Megrahi\u2019s release) smelled of a trade of oil for this man\u2019s freedom, and that was almost blasphemy given what a horrible person he was and the terrible destruction and tragedy he caused.\u201d \u201cThis is long overdue,\u201d Zwynenburg said of al Megrahi\u2019s death. \u201cIt\u2019s been 23 years now, but you never get over losing your kid.\u201d"

        "content": "A bombing at a school in Italy was likely \u201cthe isolated action of a single man\u201d and not tied to the mafia, an official said Sunday. Surveillance video shows a suspect that authorities believe is an adult, said Marco Dinapoli, attorney general in Brindisi province. The possibility that an accomplice was involved has not been ruled out, he told reporters.  Earlier Sunday, Dinapoli told CNN that police were questioning two men in connection with Saturday\u2019s blast, which killed a 16-year-old girl and injured six other people outside a school in the southern Italian city of Brindisi. One of the injured is in very serious condition, Brindisi Mayor Mimmo Consales said.  The explosion caused a chaotic scene at the school, said Fabiano Amati, regional minister for Italy\u2019s civil protection agency. \u201cThere were school backpacks and notebooks everywhere. Many windows of the nearby buildings were broken,\u201d he said. Flowers with messages for the student who died were left at the school\u2019s entrance Sunday, Italy\u2019s ANSA news agency reported. Police found three gas cylinders at the site that were detonated with a remote control, authorities said. The device \u201cwasn\u2019t very sophisticated but done by someone who knew electronics,\u201d Dinapoli said Sunday. Someone detonated it from a close distance, he said. Police were still investigating the motive behind the attack, Dinapoli said. \u201cIt could be a fool or someone angry with the world or with some ideological goal, a terrorist,\u201d he said. At demonstrations throughout the country, Italians expressed solidarity with the victims and condemned the violence. \u201cIt\u2019s an attack on all Italians because schools are considered a secure area,\u201d Amati said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time in our country that a school is under attack.\u201d Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti said the government was determined to combat crime and unite the country. He expressed the government\u2019s \u201cdeep sorrow, dismay and outrage\u201d at what he called a \u201cmost grave and heinous crime\u201d in a statement from the United States, where he was attending the G8 summit. Monti has ordered the country\u2019s flag to be displayed at half-staff through Tuesday, and sent a message of condolence to those directly affected by the blast. Italians gathered in front of the Pantheon in Rome and at Plebiscito square in Naples late Saturday to protest the violence and to show support for its victims. The explosion occurred early Saturday as students were arriving at the school, which offers vocational training, Italy\u2019s ANSA news agency reported. The Francesca Morvillo Falcone school is named after the wife of a prominent anti-mafia judge, which has fueled speculation that the organized crime group might be behind it. It has been 20 years since Falcone was assassinated in Palermo, Sicily, in May 1992. The school is located near both the tribunal and the city\u2019s tax collection agency.  Italy\u2019s tax collection agencies, called Equitalia, have been targeted by mail bombs, Molotov cocktails and suicides in front of their offices in recent months, with the incidents occurring in the cities of Rome, Livorno and Bologna, respectively. Italy\u2019s interior ministry said last week that it would start to deploy soldiers outside some government buildings because of the current tensions. The local anti-racket commission of Mesagne, a town in Brindisi province, issued a warning last week of heightened threats by both organized crime groups and anarchists against government agencies.  An anti-mafia march scheduled for Sunday is expected to proceed as scheduled."

Aftershocks rattled the country\u2019s industrial heartland throughout Sunday evening following the magnitude-6.0 quake that struck around 4 a.m. (10 p.m. Saturday ET). The head of Italy\u2019s Civil Protection Department, Franco Gabrielli, said 11,000 people had been displaced after the quake, with the government putting 3,000 of them up in tents or hotels.  In Finale Emilia, about 35 km (21 miles) north of Bologna, 75 people were sleeping in cars in a public park. One of them was Filomenna Gatti, who planned to cram into a Fiat Punto with her husband and three children under 6. \u201cI close my eyes and I see stones falling and I feel the ground shaking when it\u2019s still,\u201d Gatti said as she walked her dog. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in any building.\u201d Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti was expected to return from the NATO summit in Chicago on Monday, his government announced Sunday. Monti annoucned Sunday he was leaving the conference early, vowing, \u201cAll that is necessary will be done as soon as possible\u201d to help the survivors. The quake was centered about 4 kilometers (2.4 miles) outside Camposanto, northwest of Bologna,  the U.S. Geological Survey reported. In addition to the seven reported fatalities, 50 people were injured in the quake, Gabrielli said.  iReport: Watch the earthquake aftermath unfold  The stricken region is part of Italy\u2019s industrial heartland, and the dead included two people killed in a ceramics factory in Sant\u2019Agostino di Ferrara, about 30 km from the epicenter, civil protection agency spokeswoman Elisabetta Maffani said. Workers were still digging through rubble in hopes of finding survivors in Sant\u2019Agostino, where the quake knocked down a church bell and a magnitude-4.8 aftershock brought down part of its city hall Sunday evening.  \u201cWe have just lost our history. Four generations of my family lived here, and now it\u2019s gone,\u201d 72-year-old Luciano Frendo said as he walked through Finale Emila. \u201cOur history has collapsed.\u201d The civil protection agency said it expects to get more reports of injuries as rescue workers make their way to remote villages in the mountainous area. Heavy rain was expected to continue into Tuesday after hampering rescue efforts and efforts to spot survivors from the air.  Other deaths included one person killed when a work shed collapsed in nearby Ponte Rodoni di Bondeno, Maffani said. In addition, a woman in Bologna died of a heart attack during an evacuation, a Moroccan national died when the factory he was working in collapsed and a sixth victim was found dead under rubble in Sant\u2019Agostino, she said. The body of a seventh victim was located under a collapsed house, according to Alessio Bellodi of the civil protection branch in Bologna. The same area was struck by a 5.3-magnitude quake in January. And a 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck near the central Italian city of L\u2019Aquila, more than 400 km to the south, in 2009, killing more than 300 and causing widespread destruction."

Nadal dominated David Ferrer 7-6 6-0 in the earlier semifinal to go into his seventh final at the clay court tournament in the Italian capital. Most of the attention was on the clash between Djokovic and Federer under the Foro Italico lights, but it took until the second set for the match to warm up.

Serving for the match at 5-4, he forced a match point, saved by Federer, who proceeded to break back to level at 5-5. Roared on by the crowd, Federer took the match into tiebreaker, but after a grueling 25 stroke rally the top seed gained the mini-break. It proved crucial and at 5-4 Djokovic won his next two service points to close out the match. Earlier, five-time Rome winner Nadal fought off compatriot Ferrer, the nub of the encounter a first set tiebreak which he took 8-6. Ferrer\u2019s challenge subsided and he did not win a further game.

        "content": "To create the future of Polish cuisine, chef Wojciech Amaro looked to the 16th century for inspiration.  During a year-long odyssey to discover the origins of Poland\u2019s classic dishes, the 40-year old chef tracked down food historians and visited auction houses across the country to bid on dusty, leather-bound tomes that held the secrets of traditional recipes and long-forgotten ingredients.  \u201cI wanted to find the roots of recipes and what the original idea was behind them,\u201d he says. \u201cI realized I could talk for hours about Polish products, but I couldn\u2019t think of any (Polish dishes) that would stand at the same level.\u201d The spark for Amaro\u2019s desire to improve and update Polish cuisine was a month spent working in the kitchen of El Bulli with Ferran Adria, the culinary wizard who is often called the world\u2019s greatest chef.  \u201cHe changed my way of thinking,\u201d says Amaro, who first began his own epicurean education after dropping out of university to work in the kitchens of London restaurants.  From Bialystok in the east to Katowice in the south, Amaro racked up 60,000 kilometers on his journey that also led him to the country\u2019s best farmers and food producers, many of whom are now suppliers for Amaro\u2019s award-winning restaurant in Warsaw.  \u201cMany of them weren\u2019t aware of how great their products were. I took their enthusiasm and passion and added it to my cooking. Some of them struggled to keep up the standard that I needed, but they\u2019re growing with me,\u201d he says.  Atelier Amaro has been open for less than a year but became the first Polish restaurant to gain a \u201cMichelin Rising Star\u201d, indicating that Amaro is on the right track in his quest to elevate Polish cuisine to a new international standard. Amaro puts an emphasis on ingredients and reconstructing dishes from their essential elements, putting him in a similar mold as celebrated \u201cfood scientists\u201d like Adria, Britain\u2019s Heston Blumenthal or Rene Redzepi of the Danish restaurant Noma that was recently voted the world\u2019s best restaurant for the third straight year.  At Atelier Amaro, classic recipes like hare in cream are reimagined \u2013 \u201cwe cook it for 72 hours at 65 degrees, so its more like fois gras or butter and is eaten with a spoon\u201d \u2013 while the kitchen is also a lab in which to experiment with Polish ingredients hardly used anymore like chokeberries, wild herbs and edible flowers.  As Poles becomes more interested in their culinary culture, Amaro believes the time is now right for Poland to takes it place at the table of internationally respected cuisine.  \u201cWe\u2019ve spent 20 years (since communism) catching up in every department of life \u2013 getting good jobs, starting companies, getting mortgages. Now it\u2019s a new country and people are starting to say, \u2018What about Polish products and our traditions?\u2019 \u201cWe can\u2019t be amazed anymore by pizza or some French dishes. We are ready to search for our products and be proud of them.\u201d  Send in your best photos and videos of Poland Outside of the country attitudes to Polish food have been slowly improving, says restaurateur Jan Woroneicki, the British owner of London\u2019s Baltic restaurant and bar.  \u201cOld school perceptions that its all potatoes and cabbage are being revised, but there are still suspicions,\u201d he says.  \u201cIn soups and stews Polish cooking is equal to or greater than other cuisines, and generally quality is improving, but for restaurants it can still be a bit tricky finding quality produce like charcuterie and supply lines are not great.\u201d  Even if Polish gastronomy doesn\u2019t challenge cuisine like Thai food as an international phenomenon, Amaro hopes his restaurant can do for Polish food what Noma has done for Nordic cuisine.  \u201cCompared to Denmark, Poland is much more diverse, so if we are wise and careful about promoting Polish cuisine\u2026 we can be one of the most influential and really big cuisines like French, Italian and Spanish. There\u2019s lots of work to be done, but I think its going to happen.\u201d"

Second-half goals by Edinson Cavani and Marek Hamsik gave Napoli their first Italian Cup win since 1987 when Diego Maradona led the team in an unprecedented period of success for the club. After winning Serie A and going unbeaten through the season, Juventus were aiming for a first domestic double since 1995. \u201cIt\u2019s almost unthinkable to beat Juventus over 90 minutes when they hadn\u2019t  lost all season. It was an achievement within an achievement,\u201d Napoli  coach Walter Mazzarri said. Juve coach Antonio Conte named Del Piero in his starting lineup at Rome\u2019s Stadio Olimpico, despite fielding the forward only sparingly for the rest of the season. It was a decision that ultimately backfired. With Juve trailing 1-0 and struggling to create chances, the 37-year-old came off to warm applause to be replaced by Simone Pepe, who five minutes later came close to fashioning an equalizer only for his deflected effort to be kept our by the legs of goalkeeper Morgan De Sanctis. Napoli had gone ahead in the 62nd minute when Ezequiel Lavezzi won a penalty after goalkeeper Marco Storari\u2019s foul and Cavani converted. Hamsik made sure of a deserved win when he finished off a swift counter attack with seven minutes remaining. Juve substitute Fabio Quagliarella was sent off in the 90th minute for elbowing Aronica to complete a miserable day for the Turin club. After the celebrations die down, Napoli will turn their attentions to trying to keep hold of star players like Cavani, Hamsik and Ezequiel Lavezzi, who have all been linked with big-money moves away from the club. In France, Montpellier won the Ligue Un title for the first time in their history - leaving big-spending Paris Saint-Germain to settle for second. Montpellier only needed a draw but John Utaka scored twice to give them a 2-1 win at  bottom club Auxerre, whose home fans twice held up the game by throwing tennis balls, toilet rolls and flares onto the pitch. PSG won 2-1 at Lorient but Montpellier\u2019s result made the result irrelevant. The southern club finished three points ahead of PSG, who failed to win the title despite having a budget to dwarf all of their rivals. Since the club was taken over by Qatari owners last year, PSG have broken the French transfer record to buy Argentine playmaker Javier Pastore for \u20ac43 million, employed Brazilian Leonardo as sports director and brought in Carlo Ancelotti as coach. Elsewhere in France, Dijon and Caen joined Auxerre in dropping out of the top flight and Eden Hazard scored a hat-trick in his final game for Lille \u2013 a 4-1 win over Nancy. Hazard is set to move to England, but did not reveal which club."

The 43-year-old Scot will play Belgium\u2019s Nicolas Colsaerts with the other semifinal between 2010 U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell and home hope Rafael Cabrera-Bello. Lawrie, who has enjoyed a renaissance this season, scored two emphatic victories to reach the last four. He beat Dane Thomas Bjorn 5&4 in their last 16 clash at Finca Cortesin and then saw off two-time U.S. Open champion Retief Goosen of South Africa 6&5 in the blustery conditions. Lawrie, who famously won his only major title at a windswept Carnoustie in 1999, was delighted with his performance: \u201cYou can\u2019t really ask for more than that,\u201d Lawrie told the official European Tour website.  \u201cThe wind really picked up and under par you are going to be tough to beat.\u201d Earlier, defending champion Ian Poulter exited at the last 16 stage to Alvaro Quiros, losing 4&3. But Quiros in turn lost 3&1 to Cabrera-Bello in their all-Spanish quarterfinal. McDowell, the hero of Europe\u2019s 2010 Ryder Cup win over the United States, eased past England\u2019s Richard Finch 3&2 in the morning. But his quarterfinal against Spain\u2019s Sergio Garcia was a far closer affair. The Northern Ireland star missed a five-foot putt to win on the 18th and had more good fortune at the first extra hole. Garcia charged a 15-footer for victory and missed the return putt, leaving McDowell breathing a sigh of relief as he holed a par putt to go through. But Dubai Desert Classic winner Cabrera-Bello knows he faces a tough fight to reach the final against McDowell.  \u201cI have to play G Mac, and he has a lot of experience and is a Ryder Cup hero, so he\u2019s obviously going to be a very, very tough guy to beat,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, Jason Dufner leads the way after the third round of the Byron Nelson Classic in Texas. Dufner carded a 69 to stay two shots ahead of fellow Americans J.J. Henry and Dicky Pride and Australian Jason Day.    "

        "content": "Didier Drogba scored the winner in a dramatic penalty shoot out as Chelsea beat Bayern Munich on Saturday to win the European Champions League for the first time. The Ivorian striker coolly slotted home his kick to spark frenzied celebrations among his teammates and the Chelsea fans in Bayern\u2019s Allianz Arena. Manuel Neuer had saved Juan Mata\u2019s first penalty for Chelsea to give Bayern the early advantage in the shootout, but Petr Cech saved a weak Ivica Olic effort before Bastian Schweinsteiger saw his penalty hit the post. The match had finished 1-1 after extra time, with Thomas Mueller putting Bayern ahead in the 83rd minute before Drogba dramatically leveled with two minutes remaining.  Arjen Robben then missed a penalty in the first half of extra time, setting up the dramatic shootout finale where the home side fluffed their lines to leave the Bavarian fans stunned. Chelsea\u2019s victory capped a remarkable spell for Roberto Di Matteo since taking over as interim manager after the sacking of Andre Villas-Boas. Abramovich triumphant He has led the west London side to the English FA Cup and finally fulfilled  the ambitions of the club\u2019s Russian owner Roman Abramovich in lifting Europe\u2019s top club prize. Abramovich has ploughed an estimated $1 billion into buying the players to turn Chelsea into a European power since buying the club in 2003 and gone through eight managers in that time, but the closest he had come to the Champions League was a penalty shoot out loss to Manchester United in 2008. In the end, it was temporary option Di Matteo who delivered the famous trophy, and despite also guiding the team to FA Cup glory, the Italian coach must wait to find out if he will be appointed on a permanent basis. John Terry, suspended for the final after being sent off in the semifinal win over Barcelona, changed into his kit after the final whistle and collected the trophy from UEFA president Michel Platini with Frank Lampard, who was captain on the night. Lampard paid tribute to Drogba, whose goal rescued them in normal time before he applied the finishing touches to their triumph. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. The determination we\u2019ve shown\u2026 we didn\u2019t play fantastic but the main man Didier dug us out of trouble there,\u201d he told ITV Sport.  \u201cHe\u2019s a hero. Without him we\u2019re not here. He scores the goals in the big games.\u201d That could be the Ivorian\u2019s last big goal for the club though. Drogba, an early arrival under Abramovich\u2019s ownership for \u00a324 million ($38 million), is out of contract this summer and rumored to be considering a move to Chinese club. Threatening Bayern Playing in front of a crowd of 66,000, Bayern had always been the more threatening side throughout the match without carving out a string of clear cut chances. Their best opportunities in the first half saw a shot from Robben deflected on to his own woodwork by Cech while Bayern\u2019s top scorer Mario Gomez fired over just before the interval. Salomon Kalou\u2019s effort, pushed aside by Manuel Neuer, was the sole Chelsea effort of note. The second half followed the same pattern and just after the break Bayern had the ball in the net through Franck Ribery, but it was ruled out for offside. Fans v Oligarch: Battle for Football\u2019s soul Bayern\u2019s pressure finally paid off with seven minutes to go as Toni Kroos crossed for German international midfielder Mueller to head past Cech. It looked all over for Chelsea but their never say die attitude, so evident in the semifinal win over Barcelona, came to the fore again. Winning their first corner with only two minutes of normal time remaining,  Mata\u2019s perfect delivery was met by Drogba to head home at the near post. It was his 34th goal in the Champions League and surely never more crucial. Dramatic twist Into extra time and another dramatic twist as goal hero Drogba tripped Ribery to concede a penalty, injuring the French international who played no further part in the final. Robben, playing against his old club, stepped up after a considerable delay and his weak effort was saved by Cech. Ribery\u2019s replacement Olic wasted another glorious opportunity in the second half of extra time, caught in two minds after a Philipp Lahm cross. It summed up a frustrating night for Bayern and their coach Jupp Heynckes, who said they paid for their failure to kill off Chelsea.  \u201cWe missed too many chances,\u201d Heynckes told AFP.  \u201cWe played well overall and had the majority of possession.  \u201cBut we didn\u2019t know how to exploit our many opportunities and you have to  use them or you will be punished.\u201d Bayern had been bidding to win the Champions League for the fifth time.

By the time the tiebreak came around, the rain was falling heavily, making conditions unplayable, and it even started to rain again when the players returned two hours later to complete the match. Sharapova eventually won it 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (5) and the two players burst out laughing when they shook hands at the net. \u201cIt was a crazy match,\u201d Sharapova said. \u201cEither one of us could have won it. There really is no loser.\u201d The men\u2019s final between Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal was postponed until Monday because of the weather \u2013 prompting some fans to throw objects onto the court in disgust. Nearby, Napoli and Juventus fans were gathering for the Italian Cup final at the nearby Stadio Olimpico, and the final was punctuated by the sound of fireworks going off and police helicopters flying overhead. \u201cThe match was a joke, it was like playing a football match in the rain,\u201d  said Li, who came close to her first title since winning the French Open almost a year ago. \u201cEven when we were sent off court, you had to still concentrate for every  second, it was tiring for both players. \u201cYou could not relax. It was tense. When we came back out, she was the  tougher player. But I take some positives away. It\u2019s getting close to Roland  Garros and I think I hit the ball well. I also moved her around the court  well.\u201d Sharapova heads to Roland Garros with a second clay-court title of the year under her belt. Not traditionally a threat on the slow surface, the world No. 2 has only lost once on clay in 2012 \u2013 to Serena Williams.  \u201cThis is a great win for me going into Roland Garros,\u201d Sharapova said. \u201cIt will be nice to have a week off now, after playing three tournaments in the last four weeks. I\u2019ll have to time to recover, mentally and physically.\u201d Sharapova can complete a career Grand Slam if she wins in Paris."

Officials have given conflicting accounts of the number killed and injured. Daniela Buccoliero, an official at the Prefecture of Brindisi, a local office of the Interior Ministry, told CNN one 16-year-old girl had died and another six students are injured, two of them seriously. Brindisi Mayor Mimmo Consales and Fabiano Amati, regional minister for Italy\u2019s Civil Protection agency, said there had been two deaths as a result of the blast. Amati said the scene shortly after the explosion was \u201cdramatic.\u201d \u201cThere were school back packs and notebooks everywhere. Many windows of the nearby buildings were broken,\u201d he told CNN. Amati said the police had found three gas cylinders at the site that were detonated with a remote control. The device was concealed behind a trash can by a wall 50 meters from the entrance of the school, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an attack on all Italians because schools are considered a secure area,\u201d Amati said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time in our country that a school is under attack.\u201d Consales told CNN one of the girls had died in surgery from the wounds she sustained in the blast. Another of the injured is in very serious condition, he said.  Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Mario Monti said the government was determined to combat crime and unite the country. He expressed the government\u2019s \u201cdeep sorrow, dismay and outrage\u201d at what he called a \u201cmost grave and heinous crime\u201d in a statement from the United States, where he is attending the G8 summit. Monti was informed of the blast during the night, and has been in close contact with Italy\u2019s president, interior minister and other local authorities since. He has ordered the country\u2019s flag to be displayed at half-staff Saturday and for the next three days, and sent a message of condolence to those directly affected by the blast. Italians gathered in front of the Pantheon in Rome and at Plebiscito square in Naples late Saturday to protest the violence and to show support for its victims. Three days of mourning were declared in Brindisi, where schools will be closed through Tuesday. The explosion occurred early Saturday as students were arriving at the school, which offers vocational training, Italy\u2019s ANSA news agency reported. It is not yet clear why the school was targeted or who carried out the attack. Police chief Francesco Cirillo told CNN that the motive is under investigation and that no one has claimed responsibility.  Nichi Vendola, governor of the Puglia region where Brindisi is situated, said: \u201cIt could be either a mafia or a political terrorism attack. It\u2019s too early to say. It\u2019s an unprecedented event.\u201d The Francesca Morvillo Falcone school is named after the wife of a prominent anti-mafia judge, which has fueled speculation that the organized crime group might be behind it. It has been 20 years since Falcone was assassinated in Palermo, Sicily, in May 1992. The school is located near both the tribunal and the city\u2019s tax collection agency.  Italy\u2019s tax collection agencies, called Equitalia, have been targeted by mail bombs, Molotov cocktails and suicides in front of their offices in recent months, with the incidents occurring in the cities of Rome, Livorno and Bologna, respectively. Italy\u2019s interior ministry said this week that it would start to deploy soldiers outside some government buildings because of the current tensions. The local anti-racket commission of Mesagne, a town in Brindisi province, issued a warning last week of heightened threats by both organized crime groups and anarchists against government agencies.  An anti-mafia march that scheduled for Sunday will go ahead as scheduled."

The military parade and flypast are the first major national event to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee, the Ministry of Defence said. The central weekend of celebrations comes in early June, when the Queen will take part in concerts and a pageant involving more than 1,000 boats on the River Thames. The Queen hosted a lunch on Friday at Windsor Castle to which every monarch in the world was invited, also as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall also hosted a dinner at Buckingham Palace on Friday evening for some of the royals. Human rights campaigners criticized the decision to include monarchs of countries with a poor record on human rights in Friday\u2019s events. Among those they highlighted were the king of Bahrain, whose government has come under fire for its handling of continuing unrest, and Swaziland\u2019s King Mswati III, accused by critics of enjoying a lavish lifestyle at public expense while his people suffer great poverty.

A temporary Greek government took office Thursday as the country wrestles with a political crisis that sprang from its inability to pay its debts. Greece is heading toward new elections next month, with polls suggesting a narrow victory for a radical leftist party that wants to tear up an international loan agreement that forced the government to make deep budget cuts. That possibility has sent ripples of fear through markets in Europe, Asia and the United States as analysts worry that it could ultimately lead to the collapse of the euro currency used by 17 European nations. Ratings agency Fitch cut Greece\u2019s long-term credit rating from B- to CCC on Thursday, reflecting worries about its ability to remain in the eurozone. \u201cThe downgrade of Greece\u2019s sovereign ratings reflects the heightened risk that Greece may not be able to sustain its membership of Economic and Monetary Union,\u201d Fitch said. \u201cIn the event that the new general elections scheduled for 17 June fail to produce a government with a mandate to continue with the EU-IMF programme of fiscal austerity and structural reform, an exit of Greece from EMU would be probable.\u201d Antonis Samaras, the leader of Greece\u2019s New Democracy party, slammed the possibility of a referendum.  \u201cThe Greek people do not need a referendum to prove their choice of the euro, a choice that it defends with bloody sacrifices,\u201d Samaras said. \u201cMerkel\u2019s proposal tonight about a referendum \u2013 and at a pre-election time \u2013 is, at the very least, unfortunate and cannot be accepted.\u201d Samaras\u2019 party narrowly came in first in this month\u2019s elections, but opinion polls since then have suggested that Syriza would finish in first place in a new election. Alexis Tsipras, the leader of the Syriza party who leads in polls ahead of the June 17 election, said Friday that with the vote, \u201cThe Greek people will hold a final answer. \u2026 This will put an end to the austerity bailouts, submission and lack of dignity and will pave the way to progressive developments for the entire of Europe.\u201d  Greek voters punished the major parties at the polls May 6 for the harsh budget cuts imposed by the country\u2019s international lenders, the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund.  The election left no party able to form a government, creating deep uncertainty about Greece\u2019s ability to continue to meet the terms of its bailout package and therefore its debt obligations. In her call with Papoulias on Friday, \u201c(Merkel) reiterated the German position that Europe is waiting for the elections and that it is the wish of all European partners and also of Germany that a government is formed as quickly as possible after the elections,\u201d a German government spokeswoman said. Merkel said Wednesday that she is working to keep Greece in the eurozone. \u201cEurope needs to show solidarity and help, particularly with growth, unemployment and development,\u201d she said. Merkel, a champion of forcing governments to balance their budgets in order to promote stable economic growth in Europe, said she regrets the suffering of the Greek people in the face of tough budget cuts. \u201cIt\u2019s very bitter, obviously,\u201d she said of the austerity measures that have left some Greeks struggling to pay for food or utilities. But, she said, \u201cSacrifices had to be made. \u2026 I think these are necessary measures that had to be taken.\u201d"

        "content": "Spain\u2019s government called for calm Friday, a day after rating agency Moody\u2019s downgraded 16 Spanish banks in the latest sign of distress in Europe. Among those who saw their ratings lowered were giants Banco Santander and BBVA, the country\u2019s two largest banks. \u201cOn behalf of the government, I want to first send a message of calm to the investors and depositors as the government \u2026 tries to guarantee the solvency and capacity of all the institutions to carry out their obligations,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said.  At a Cabinet meeting Friday, Spanish ministers agreed that the top priority regarding the economy is controlling the deficit.  Moody\u2019s cited concerns about the banks\u2019 exposure to Spain\u2019s faltering economy and the \u201creduced\u201d ability of the Spanish government to support them in a crisis. The downgrades come amid rising concern about the political and economic turmoil in Greece, and the potential ripple effect of that crisis on nations like Spain and Italy that are struggling with low growth and big debts.  \u201cThe Spanish economy has fallen back into recession in first-quarter 2012, and Moody\u2019s does not expect conditions to improve during 2012,\u201d the rating agency said as it announced the downgrades.  \u201cMoreover, the real-estate crisis that began in 2008 is ongoing, and unemployment has risen to very high levels, with rising risks to white-collar employment (in addition to extremely-high youth unemployment) affecting the outlook for banks\u2019 household lending.\u201d Shares in Spanish banks were up in early trading Friday, as markets digested news of the downgrades, which had been widely expected. The Spanish bank Bankia, which was effectively nationalized this month, was not mentioned by Moody\u2019s, but the government was forced to step in Thursday to deny rumors of a run on bank deposits. \u201cI think this is a good moment to send out a calming message to all the savers. It is not true that there would be a large-scale exit of savings from Bankia at this moment,\u201d the country\u2019s deputy economy minister said. Bankia also issued a statement saying deposit holders could be confident about the safety of their savings.  The bank saw shares surge by as much as 30% early Friday, recovering some of the heavy losses suffered in recent days. Global investors have been unnerved by the political uncertainty in Greece, amid fears it could leave the eurozone should anti-austerity parties win enough votes in elections next month and default on its huge debts. Ratings agency Fitch downgraded Greece\u2019s long-term credit rating from B- to CCC on Thursday, citing the increased risk that Greece could be forced to leave the eurozone. An exit from the eurozone would be \u201cprobable\u201d if the elections fail to produce a government willing to stand by earlier austerity agreements reached with eurozone leaders, Fitch said. In turn, the country\u2019s departure from the eurozone would \u201cresult in widespread default on private sector as well as sovereign euro-denominated obligations,\u201d the ratings agency said. This would have an impact on the other 16 nations in the eurozone single-currency area, it warned. Spain\u2019s borrowing costs have been rising as investors in the bond market fear it could become the next euro area nation to fall victim to the debt crisis. Overall, Spain has pledged to cut its national deficit to 5.3% of GDP, but the European Commission forecast last week that the country would fail to meet that goal, instead hitting 6.4% of GDP.  Spain has announced roughly $35 billion in budget cuts this year."

        "content": "\u201cIt was the only race that frightened me, actually,\u201d motorsport legend Stirling Moss says of Italy\u2019s historic endurance rally \u2013 the Mille Miglia. \u201cIt certainly was one of the races throughout the year where I thought, \u2018Oh God,\u2019 because I didn\u2019t know where I was going.\u201d Translated as the \u201cThousand Miles,\u201d the race was held on public roads. Competitors set off from Brescia and blazed a trail south to Rome, before turning around and returning to the northern city. The rally was a true test of speed, courage and navigation. The Mille Miglia\u2019s origins date back to the early days of motorsport and the decision to move the 1922 Italian Grand Prix from Brescia to Monza, near Milan. The switch proved unpopular in Brescia, and when an automobile club was formed in the city in 1927, they sought to put on a racing spectacle of their own. The rest, as they say, is history. For 30 years between 1927 and 1957, competitors \u2013 including Moss and five-time Formula One world champion Juan Manuel Fangio \u2013 pushed their vehicles to the limit in an attempt to reach the finish line. It has since been resurrected as a serene, grand touring event, but in its racing years the prospect of driving at breakneck speeds down everyday roads was both a trial and a thrill for participants. Moss says it made for a nerve-shredding ride. \u201cImagine going up a large incline towards a village and going at 185 mph without knowing which way the road goes,\u201d the 82-year-old told CNN ahead of this week\u2019s 2012 edition. \u201cIf there is a turn over the brow, you need to know about.\u201d In 1955, ably assisted by co-pilot Denis Jackson, the British driver loosened Italy\u2019s stranglehold on the race, sealing one of only three Mille Miglia victories by a foreigner in record-breaking fashion. Moss, one of the best drivers never to win the F1 world title, set an average speed record for the route, clocking a time of 10 hours seven minutes and 48 seconds. But when asked about one of the highlights of his 14-year racing career, Moss\u2019 response was surprising. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I\u2019d won,\u201d he explained. \u201cAll I knew is that I was the leader at the stop before.  \u201cI didn\u2019t know I\u2019d won until my time had been split and I knew I couldn\u2019t be passed, so it was a terrible anticlimax. I was very much on tenterhooks waiting. It was anticlimactic but nonetheless very exhilarating.\u201d But when compared to all the races staged throughout motorsport history, including the 66 F1 grands prix Moss started, what set the Mille Miglia apart? \u201cThe whole of Italy turns out, it\u2019s absolutely staggering,\u201d he said. \u201cAll across the whole country, people come out and line the roads. It\u2019s amazing, more than five millions spectators. It\u2019s something that could happen nowhere else but Italy.  \u201cThe one thing you must remember is we were genuinely doing speeds of 185 mph, on ordinary roads. There were no autostrasses or dual carriageways. And the amount of cars you have to pass, hundreds of cars, it\u2019s pretty daunting.\u201d Ultimately, it was the element of danger which proved the race\u2019s downfall. In addition to glorious victory, the Mille Miglia\u2019s legacy is also littered with fatal crashes. The most infamous was in 1957 in the village of Guidizzolo, a tragedy which proved to be the final nail in the race\u2019s coffin. Spanish driver Alfonso de Portago\u2019s Ferrari veered off the road and tore through a group of spectators, killing the driver, his co-pilot and nine bystanders, five of which were children. \u201cA lot of the drivers \u2013 you had hairdressers, you had chefs \u2013 really weren\u2019t competent enough to drive at the speeds you had to drive at,\u201d recalls Moss. \u201cIn the modern day, one could not take the death toll. As the years passed, people dying in motorsport like that became unacceptable.\u201d The 2012 edition began on Thursday, with Moss in attendance to take part in the festivities. Despite no longer being a rip-roaring, high-speed chase, the fabled tour still draws a big crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely terrific,\u201d said Moss after this year\u2019s event had got underway. \u201cThe enthusiasm of the people here \u2026 The Italians line the streets, pat you on the head, it\u2019s just great.  \u201cPeople bring their own cars, if they\u2019re fast cars, and go around. It\u2019s something very special.\u201d Reflecting on the Mille Miglia as it was 60 years ago, Moss believes it had a certain spark which modern day motorsport hasn\u2019t quite rekindled. \u201cWhen the race car was just an ordinary road car, a bit faster of course, that was terribly exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure it is today, but I\u2019m not sure it would be quite as exciting as it was then.\u201d"

        "content": "When Chelsea and Bayern Munich walk out onto the pitch at the Allianz Arena for Saturday\u2019s European Champions League final, it will mark the culmination of a competition rightly regarded as the finest \u2013 and the hardest to win \u2013 in club football.  Some of the greatest teams in the world have fallen by the wayside in race for the prize: Jose Mourinho\u2019s Real Madrid and Alex Ferguson\u2019s Manchester United, to name but two. It was also the last bow for Pep Guardiola, arguably the greatest coach in charge of the greatest team of the modern era, who left Barcelona shortly after Champions League semifinal defeat against Chelsea. But it is much more than a match between the two best teams in Europe. It is also a clash of ideas over how football should best be run, and whether money and the success that statistically follows should trump the interests of the supporters. Bayern vs. Chelsea: Click here to see the finalists\u2019 vital statistics On one hand you have Chelsea, a club which has benefited most from the financial liberalism of English football, an economic boom that followed the breakaway of the English Premier League two decades ago.  England\u2019s laissez-faire economic approach meant that a young, unknown Russian oligarch who had only recently fallen in love with the beautiful game could purchase a club he had never visited and pump in hundreds of millions of dollars to secure trophies and league titles. Ticket prices rocketed as the game was gentrified, but Chelsea tasted real domestic success, winning three league titles, four FA Cups and two League Cups.  On the other side is Bayern. Derided as \u201cFC Hollywood\u201d by some supporters of its Bundesliga rivals due to the Bavarian team\u2019s star-studded squad, it is still governed by the fan ownership model prevalent in Germany. The \u201c50+1\u201d rule prevents rich foreign and domestic businessmen from taking over clubs.  Instead, the fans own the majority of the club (at least 50% plus one, hence the title). It keeps ticket prices low, and preserves the country\u2019s football culture while ensuring the stadiums are full.  Anglo Saxon economics  Though the cheapest ticket for a top-grade match in Munich may well cost less than $20 \u2013 compared to over $80 at Chelsea \u2013 Bayern, and German clubs in general, have enjoyed far less success in Europe over the past decade compared to their English counterparts. \u201cIn England, the change to football mirrored the wider free-market approach to business and the economy generally,\u201d argues David Conn, a journalist for British newspaper The Guardian and a staunch supporter of the German model of ownership.  \u201cState-owned businesses were privatized, and the football clubs were bought, floated on the stock market or sold on, and the few people who owned the shares made a great deal of money for themselves. Ticket prices have risen by around 1,000% since. \u201cGerman football is flourishing with the highest crowds in Europe and Bayern in the final. Yet they had no similar money-obsessed change to the way they had always done things. Bayern has 13,500 standing places, at \u20ac15 ($20) each, for top games.  \u201cThat is a great beacon for the collective way of running football, and gives the lie to the Premier League argument that selling the clubs to overseas buyers, making them available for people to profit from, and unleashing ticket prices to maximize income is a necessary basis for success.\u201d Premier League revolution The introduction of the Premier League into English football in 1992 transformed everything.  Before then, English football was dying under the weight of hooliganism and indifference. The 1989 Hillsborough tragedy, where 96 Liverpool fans standing during a match were crushed to death, also had a huge impact. The tragedy led to the Taylor Report, which recommended all-seater stadiums be made compulsory.  In a stroke football found itself rebranded, with a new source of income thanks to Sky\u2019s pioneering purchase of the English game\u2019s television rights. But there was no mechanism to stop the rise of ticket prices to help pay for this bright new era of top-class players being paid six-figure weekly salaries.  Nor was there any true barrier to who could own a club. Like any other business in the UK, a football team could be bought and sold by anyone who could borrow enough money.  The global popularity made the Premier League popular to global businessmen and after Chelsea was sold to Roman Abramovich, the floodgates opened. Manchester City, which last weekend won the English title for the first time in 44 years, was bought in 2008 by Sheikh Mansour, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family.  He in turn bought the club from former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Across the city, Manchester United was sold to the American Glazer family, owners of the NFL\u2019s Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in a leveraged buyout \u2013 essentially by borrowing money they didn\u2019t have. Currently half of the Premier League\u2019s 20 teams are in foreign hands attracted both to its popularity and also the huge numbers involved. Take the Premier League\u2019s latest figures. As many as five billion people watched the 2010-2011 season but it is the prize money that is even more surprising. According to the Sporting Intelligence blog Manchester City took home over \u00a360 million ( close to $100 million) for the season, with over half of that figure is in mandatory payments from TV rights. The bottom team, Wolverhampton Wanderers, still secured \u00a339.1 million ($61.9 million).  The upside of money Not everyone sees the downside of the glut of cash that has flowed into the English game. \u201cBecause of fan influence, fans have prevented ticket prices from rising in Germany and they are 50% lower than in England,\u201d argues Professor Stefan Szymanski, co-author of the book \u201cSoccernomics.\u201d \u201cBut although tickets prices are twice as high (in England) almost exactly the same amount of people go to watch, and way more people watch second and third-tier football than in Germany. The money gets largely spent on players.  \u201cThe money does not go into the pockets of fat cats as the clubs make no money. England pays way higher wages than in Germany. You ask Manchester City fans what they think about large ticket prices, they\u2019d be quite happy. You get more expensive players and far better performance.\u201d Szymanski points to English clubs\u2019 relative success against German sides in the Champions League over the past decade. English teams have won 36 matches of 68 total encounters, German teams just 16. \u201cGerman fans complain bitterly that their teams are not competitive in Europe because other teams spend more money than they do,\u201d he says, adding that financial transparency is also improved.  \u201cI\u2019ve got 95% of the published accounts in England between 1984 to 2010 \u2013 3,200 sets of accounts. I physically possess them. England is totally transparent. In Germany, you just have to trust those running the club.\u201d A level playing field? Not all German clubs are governed by the \u201c50+1\u201d rules. Wolfsburg and Bayer Leverkusen are both owned by corporations \u2013 Volkswagen and the pharmaceutical giant Bayer \u2013 while Hoffenheim has been bankrolled by a German billionaire who officially owns a minority stake but whose money makes the club\u2019s continued presence in the Bundesliga almost entirely dependent on him.  And many German soccer fans would recoil in laughter at the thought that Bayern Munich is somehow the club of the people. \u201cIt is not so much the ownership structure, it is that they are the superpower abusing their position, arrogant and systematically weakening all the other teams by buying the best players,\u201d explains CNN contributor and Suddeutsche Zeitung correspondent Raphael Honigstein.   \u201cMaybe the best comparison is with Manchester United 10 years ago, before the Glazers. They had a tremendous supporter base (Bayern boasts a fan base of over nine million in Germany alone) and there was hatred from them because of their success. \u201cIt (the \u201950+1\u2019 rule) is good, it has symbolic value and does stop excess. But it doesn\u2019t really stop people who really want to get involved and it allows for exceptions which angers clubs. It is not the promised land.\u201d  Partial proof of this can be found in the remarkable success both clubs have in generating revenue. Although Bayern is 82% owned by fans (compared to 0% cent at Chelsea), according to the 2012 Deloitte Football Money League Bayern made \u00a371.6 million ($113 million) more in revenue last year than Chelsea.  Bayern also has a brand new, state-of-the-art, 70,000-capacity stadium and can afford to sign top internationals such as Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and Mario Gomez.  Winner takes all? Both clubs made it to the final of the Champions League, but will whoever wins truly prove which model is best? \u201cI think a victory for Bayern is definitely a victory for the supporter-owned model of a club,\u201d says Conn. \u201c(German clubs have) standing areas and affordable tickets, so young people and poorer people from all sections of society can still support football, as they have done since the game began \u2013 until 1992 in England.\u201d Of course, if Chelsea fans are celebrating on Saturday, they would beg to differ. ."

        "content": "Andy Murray\u2019s poor form going into the French Open continued as he lost to Richard Gasquet in the third round of the Rome Masters. After some initial stiff resistance, taking the first set after a tie break, Murray lost the next two 6-3, 6-2. He later revealed he has been suffering with a back injury all year and is now a doubt to play at Roland Garros.  \u201c(It was a) long match and sore back towards the end, but I was expecting that coming to the tournament,\u201d he told the ATP\u2019s official website.  \u201cI didn\u2019t take a break from training and playing a lot, but the muscles are more tired and fatigued.\u201d He later told AFP that he will have little chance to rest his back in the run up to the French Open. \u201cI\u2019ve felt it for some months, but I haven\u2019t had a chance to take a pause,\u201d he said.   \u201cI\u2019ve tried not to make it any worse, but the muscles get tired from  compensating \u2026 I\u2019ve got a lot of big events coming and there\u2019s not that much time to rest  any niggles. Hopefully when the French comes, the goal is to be in peak  condition.\u201d Defending champion and top seed Novak Djokovic was given a shock when Juan Monaco of Argentina won the first set of their third-round clash.

After his problems on the blue clay of Madrid, Rafael Nadal was not in a generous mood beating Spaniard Marcel Granollers 6-1, 6-1. \u201cConditions were difficult and windy but I think I found rhythm and after third game I played very solid,\u201d Nadal said. He goes on to play Tomas Berdych in the quarterfinals.  Madrid champion Roger Federer also reached the last eight, digging deep to beat fellow former world No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain 6-2 5-7 6-1. Second-ranked Federer will next face Italy\u2019s Andreas Seppi, who beat his Swiss Davis Cup teammate Stanislas Wawrinka 6-7 (1-7) 7-6 (8-6) 7-6 (8-6). The women\u2019s draw was rocked by the withdrawal of world number one Victoria Azarenka after she injured her right shoulder.  Second seed Maria Sharapova beat Ana Ivanovic 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 to set up a quarterfinal clash with another fellow former world No. 1 Venus Williams. The American, who has never played Sharapova on clay before, beat Australia\u2019s U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur 6-4 6-3.

        "content": "Rights groups have slammed a lunch hosted by Britain\u2019s Queen Elizabeth II on Friday for including monarchs criticized for their countries\u2019 human rights records. Among those who attended the event at Windsor Castle is the king of Bahrain, whose government has come under fire for its crackdown on anti-government protests last year and its handling of continuing unrest. Swaziland\u2019s King Mswati III, accused by critics of enjoying a lavish lifestyle at public expense while his people suffer great poverty, was also there. The monarchs\u2019 lunch, with a menu that included English asparagus, lamb from Windsor and strawberries from Kent, is part of celebrations of the Queen\u2019s Diamond Jubilee, marking her 60 years on the throne. It will be followed by an evening banquet at Buckingham Palace hosted by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.  Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said it was \u201coutrageous that the queen has invited royal tyrants to celebrate her Diamond Jubilee.\u201d He called for the invitations to monarchs heading nations with poor records on rights to be withdrawn immediately and said protesters would stage a rally outside Buckingham Palace as royals arrive for the dinner. \u201cThe invitations are a shocking misjudgment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey show the queen is out of touch with the humanitarian values of most British people. She\u2019s putting royalty before human rights.\u201d  No significant protests marked the monarchs\u2019 arrival at Windsor, where they were each greeted by the queen and the duke of Edinburgh before sitting down to eat. But rights group Amnesty International said the event risked giving the impression that Britain did not care about the victims of human rights abuses. \u201cWe can imagine why victims of recent human rights abuses in countries like Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Swaziland and Thailand might feel their plight has been ignored when they see the guest list for the queen\u2019s diamond jubilee celebrations,\u201d said Philip Luther, Middle East and North Africa director for Amnesty International.  He said that Bahrain\u2019s King Hamad al-Khalifa had tried to address the abuses committed last year by setting up an independent inquiry but that failures to ensure reforms are fully implemented \u201cmake his promises seem hollow.\u201d Luther added: \u201cHe should use this occasion to commit to releasing the prisoners of conscience still held in Bahrain and ensure true accountability for the violations of the last year.\u201d The UK Foreign Office said all the world\u2019s sovereigns have been invited to the lunch, which was organized by the Royal Household with its support, although all will not necessarily attend. A Foreign Office spokesman defended the inclusion of al-Khalifa at the lunch, saying Britain and Bahrain \u201cwork together closely on a range of important issues.\u201d \u201cThe UK is a longstanding friend and ally of Bahrain, and ministers regularly meet with Bahraini counterparts in the UK and abroad,\u201d he said. \u201cThis strong relationship also allows us to have a full and frank discussion on a range of\u00a0issues including those where we have concerns. On human rights, we support the reforms already under way in Bahrain, and we want to help promote that reform.\u201d The reforms include \u201cbringing to account those individuals responsible for human rights abuses,\u201d he said. Grand Prix organizers were urged to cancel the F1 race in Bahrain last month because of concerns about human rights. Bahrain is home to the U.S. Fifth Fleet and is viewed as an important bulwark against Iran\u2019s influence in the Persian Gulf. Bahrain\u2019s king is not on the guest list for the smaller evening event, but Swaziland\u2019s monarch is among those invited to both lunch and dinner. The menus for the two meals have not been made public. Royals from Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, Monaco, Brunei, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Thailand are among those invited to both events, as are the emperor and empress of Japan. The Spanish queen did not attend, however, amid tensions over a planned visit by Prince Edward and his wife next month to Gibraltar, a UK territory that Spain also claims. \u201cQueen Sofia has canceled her visit to the UK for the Jubilee celebrations following the advice from the Spanish government that the visit would be inappropriate in the current circumstances regarding Gibraltar,\u201d a spokesman for the Spanish Royal Household said."

        "content": "Greece handed over the Olympic flame to Britain in an elaborate ceremony Thursday, 71 days before the start of the London 2012 Olympic Games. Following a display by performers representing the high priestesses of ancient Greece, the torch was accepted by Princess Anne, the British Olympic Association president. Crowds gathered despite rainy weather to watch the handover in the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens. It was attended by soccer player David Beckham and London\u2019s recently re-elected mayor, Boris Johnson, as well as five young Britons picked for their commitment to sport. The flame, which has already made a weeklong journey around Greece after being lit at ancient Olympia, birthplace of the Games, will be carried back to the UK by the British delegation on Friday. The 70-day torch relay around Britain starts Saturday in the far southwest of England, in Land\u2019s End, Cornwall. Along its route, which will take in in towns, villages and cities across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland before reaching London, the torch will pass within 10 miles of 95% of the UK population. Sebastian Coe, the British Olympian who heads the London 2012 organizing group, said many of the 8,000 torch bearers had inspirational personal stories to share. The torch relay also will tell the story of a \u201cmodern and confident United Kingdom,\u201d he said, ahead of Games that he hopes will unite the world in challenging times. The handover in Athens comes against the backdrop of political and economic turmoil roiling Greece.   A temporary Greek government took office Thursday as the country wrestles with a political crisis that sprang from the country\u2019s inability to pay its debts."

        "content": "It\u2019s not a phrase that usually gets said out loud, but you have to feel sorry for Cristiano Ronaldo. The Real Madrid player has just finished the season of his life, winning Spain\u2019s La Liga while vanquishing the club\u2019s hated Catalan foes Barcelona. He scored more goals than he ever has before too, 46 in the league to be precise, and 60 overall. Yet even though Madrid finished nine points clear of second place, it is Barca\u2019s Lionel Messi that still gets all the attention. \u201cSome people say I\u2019m better, other people say it\u2019s him, but at the end of the day, they\u2019re going to decide who is the best player,\u201d Ronaldo told CNN in an exclusive interview before this weekend\u2019s Champions League final between Bayern Munich and Chelsea at Munich\u2019s Allianz Arena. \u201cAt the moment \u2026 I think it is me,\u201d he laughs. \u201cSometimes (the comparisons with Messi) makes me tired \u2026 for him too because they compare us together all the time.  Messi breaks Barcelona\u2019s all-time scoring record \u201cYou cannot compare a Ferrari with a Porsche because it\u2019s a different engine. You cannot compare them. He does the best things for Barcelona, I do the best things for Madrid.  \u201cI think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high. This is why Madrid and Barcelona are the best teams in the world because everyone pushes each other, not just me and Messi but other players.\u201d Good cop/bad cop Perhaps Ronaldo is right. The world needs the \u201cgood cop/bad cop\u201d routine of Messi and Ronaldo to bring the best out of both them. It might be the reason why neither has set the world alight on the international stage. But while Messi is hailed as a secular saint, Ronaldo is derided for his self-confidence, some would say over-confidence. How does he cope with the vitriol he provokes in opposition fans? \u201cSometimes, you have to put on a mask. You cannot smile every time for all the people. It\u2019s impossible, I cannot do that,\u201d he says.  \u201cThis is not my type of personality. And people really don\u2019t know me. And I do it for that because I don\u2019t want every person to know me, just close friends \u2026 you know, my friends, teammates. These people know me very well. Other people, to be honest, I really don\u2019t care about that.\u201d Still, such has been Madrid\u2019s dominance in the league that Ronaldo is entitled to feel, if not exactly sycophantic praise, then at least recognition of his and his team\u2019s achievements. \u201cMy high point (in my career) is to win the title here in Madrid, La Liga,\u201d he explains.  Clasico win gives Real the edge over rivals \u201c(It) was my first time, so I was so happy because it\u2019s my best moment here in Madrid, the most important trophy. In terms of individual, it was great for me, the goals that I scored, to break my own record \u2026 to do 100 points in the Spanish league which is a record too. It\u2019s phenomenal.  \u201cFor me this is the most difficult league in the world. To compete with Barcelona, as everyone knows is very complicated and we beat them. Nine points ahead \u2026 so it was an amazing year.\u201d In Barca\u2019s shadow?  Barcelona. It is the shadow that follows not just Ronaldo, but also Real coach Jose Mourinho, who has also had a remarkable season in Spain. You could argue it is a shadow that follows the city of Madrid around too.  \u201cThe points speak for themselves,\u201d Ronaldo replies when asked about the rivalry. \u201cNine points separated Madrid and Barcelona; it\u2019s a lot here in Spain. We played better than them this year, I\u2019m sure about that. I remember we went there one month ago and we won 2-1\u2026nobody can do that, it\u2019s very difficult so we deserve to win the league. We are better than them at the moment, but we have to respect them because they are a great team too.\u201d Now there has never been a better time for Real Madrid to break the spell of Barcelona. With coach Pep Guardiola gone and questions being raised about the age of the Barca squad, Ronaldo believes that Madrid could go on to do something special, with the \u201cSpecial One\u201d at the helm. Drained Guardiola quits Barca \u201cAs a person (Jose Mourinho\u2019s) a humble guy \u2026 he\u2019s very simple. We joke all the time, with funny stories all the time. It\u2019s great. In terms of coaching, he\u2019s completely different. He\u2019s so serious, so professional.\u201d  For Ronaldo, Mourinho has proven himself to be the best coach in the world. \u201cThis is why he wins the titles that he won. Because for me, not just because I work with him, but he\u2019s the best because of what he does: the tactics, everything around the players, the motivation \u2026 and you know, the titles speak for themselves. He won in every country that he\u2019s passed, so I think that\u2019s great. I think nobody \u2026 two or three coaches do that in their lives, so we have to appreciate that.\u201d  The worst day Yet the season has not been without its disappointments. It may well have delivered the greatest single triumph in Ronaldo\u2019s career so far, but it also delivered its nadir \u2013 losing to Bayern on penalties in the Champions League semifinals. Ronaldo missed a spot-kick during the shootout as Real\u2019s wait for a record-extending 10th European title spilled into its second decade. \u201cTo be honest, it was one of the worst days in my career so far,\u201d he admits. Ronaldo, Real Madrid suffer heartache  \u201cIt\u2019s always tough when you lose something, when you lose on penalties. But I\u2019m not really worried about that because if I didn\u2019t score the two goals most of the players aren\u2019t going to shoot the penalties, so I have to appreciate what I did in the Champions League, what I did for the club.\u201d The dream Madrid-Barcelona final didn\u2019t happen. Instead we have a final that no one could predict. On the one hand a Bayern Munich side that unexpectedly fought back to knock out Madrid. On the other hand a Chelsea side that shocked Barcelona, the world, and one suspects, even themselves. Who does Ronaldo think will win? \u201cMost people think that Bayern is going to win easily. I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he says, perhaps remembering the battles he had with Chelsea while playing for Manchester United in the English Premier League. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that Chelsea beat Barcelona, which is very, very tough. It will be an interesting game. I don\u2019t know which team is going to win. I\u2019m not going to bet on anything because Chelsea is very strong. They defend well, they have a good counterattack. Bayern is a fantastic team too, so it will be a good game.\u201d  In 12 months\u2019 time he will hope to realign the order of things and play in the 2013 Champions League final. For now he\u2019ll have to make do with being the best player in the best league with the best manager in the world.  Should you feel sorry for Cristiano Ronaldo? So far everything seems to be going just fine.

        "content": "The Chinese Super League has seen its global profile skyrocket over the last 12 months with the arrival of several high-profile football stars in big-money deals. The trend continued on Thursday with the announcement that Italy\u2019s 2006 World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi will take over the reigns at ambitious Guangzhou Evergrande on a two-and-a-half-year contract. \u201cI dispatched an assistant to go see the club\u2019s matches, which made me even more determined,\u201d the 64-year-old told a press conference which was broadcast live on Chinese state television. \u201cI am very enthusiastic about coming to China.\u201d Lippi has an impressive managerial record, having coached Juventus to five Italian Serie A titles and the European Champions League in 1996. Guangzhou, China\u2019s reigning champions, started the spending spree last year by signing Argentine playmaker Dario Conca from Brazilian side Fluminense for a national record transfer fee. Conca has since been joined in China by former France striker Nicolas Anelka, who, after a prolific career across Europe, swapped Chelsea for Shanghai Shenhua in January. Paraguay\u2019s Lucas Barrios will become the latest recruit when he signs for Guangzhou from German champions Borussia Dortmund on June 1, for a fee which eclipses the one paid for Conca. So what is attracting such stellar names to a country which has a limited football heritage? \u201cThere are things happening in Chinese football but there is still a long way to go,\u201d Asian football expert John Duerden told CNN.  \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that Lippi has been always been desperate to work in the Chinese Super League, though China is a fascinating place and some of the cities are fantastic.\u201d Previous coach Lee-Jang soo had achieved on-field success with Guangzhou, leading the club out of the second tier, to the 2011 Super League title and into the Asian Champions League. But Duerden said Lee\u2019s profile was not big enough for a club with grand ambitions. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the name,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile Lee is well-liked in China and east Asia, outside the region he has little standing. Hiring Lippi sends the message that Guangzhou want to be Asia\u2019s first superclub.\u201d Duerden said the surge in football spending in China has been financed by powerful political figures, but that it may be detrimental to the future of the sport in the country. \u201cThe spark is all down to politics, power and connections. The next generation of China\u2019s leaders, including the next president are fans of football, and it is a great way for business leaders to get close to the decision-makers. \u201cThere is a huge disconnect between what the game actually needs and what it is getting. There are less than 10,000 registered under-12 players in China (Japan, with a tenth of the population has over 300,000) and you have to wonder what a similar amount of money would do if invested in the grassroots.\u201d Since arriving in Shanghai, Anelka has seen his role at Shenhua change. Last month, the 33-year-old was added to former Fulham manager Jean Tigana\u2019s coaching staff. Tigana then resigned from his position, paving the way for Anelka to assume a surprise player-coach role. \u201cThe situation is fairly chaotic at Shanghai and the team is pretty mediocre,\u201d said Duerden. \u201cBig money was spent on new strikers but what the team really needs is midfielders. \u201cHe (Anelka) does seem committed and is starting to talk to the press a little more. He also has the respect of the players, for obvious reasons, and he seems to be taking the coaching role quite seriously.\u201d Meanwhile, Manchester United announced on Thursday that striker Michael Owen has left the English club following the expiration of his contract. The former Liverpool and Real Madrid star has been ravaged by injury during his three years at Old Trafford, scoring just five goals in 31 Premier League appearances. "

        "content": "With much of the business and financial world waiting nervously for the results of new elections in Greece, young people on the streets of Athens on Thursday sounded more concerned about the hardships the Greek people are facing than the international consequences of their upcoming vote. Clara Kalemi, 18, said her father had been unemployed for two years. \u201cFinally he got a job but with a very low salary. We can\u2019t afford this,\u201d she said. University student Romans Eksarhos said he and his classmates have little to look forward to. \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything; we don\u2019t have any hope for our lives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that we are going to finish university, get our degree, maybe our Ph.D., and we are going to work for 300 euros\u201d a month. That\u2019s about $380. A temporary Greek government took office Thursday as the country wrestles with a political crisis that sprang from the country\u2019s inability to pay its debts. Greece is heading toward new elections next month, with polls suggesting a narrow victory for a radical leftist party that wants to tear up an international loan agreement which forced the government to make deep budget cuts. That possibility has sent ripples of fear through markets in Europe, Asia and the United States as analysts worry that it could ultimately lead to the collapse of the European Union\u2019s currency \u2013 an event an expert predicted Thursday could cost up to $1 trillion. Ratings agency Fitch cut Greece\u2019s long-term credit rating from B- to CCC Thursday, only one notch above default level, reflecting worries over its ability to remain in the euro currency zone. \u201cThe downgrade of Greece\u2019s sovereign ratings reflects the heightened risk that Greece may not be able to sustain its membership of  Economic and Monetary Union,\u201d Fitch said. \u201cIn the event that the new general elections scheduled for 17 June fail to produce a government with a mandate to continue with the EU-IMF programme of fiscal austerity and structural reform, an exit of Greece from EMU would be probable.\u201d IMF is the International Monetary Fund Alexis Tsipras, the leader of the Syriza party, leads in polls ahead of the June 17 election. On Thursday he urged the public to support him. Read Tsipras equate austerity with \u2018hell\u2019 \u201cPeople will conquer fear. They will not succumb; they will not be blackmailed,\u201d he said, accusing the parties that made the international loan agreement of \u201cirresponsible scare-mongering.\u201d The Centre for Economics Business and Research in London, meanwhile, issued a stark warning Thursday. \u201cThe end of the euro in its current form is certain but will be traumatic,\u201d predicted the CEBR\u2019s Douglas McWilliams.  He estimated that the \u201cimmensely painful\u201d breakdown of the currency used by 17 countries would cost a minimum of $300 million.  The European Central Bank said Wednesday it had stopped providing cheap money to some Greek banks after Greeks pulled about 800 million euros ($1 billion) in savings out of the banking system on Monday. It would not say which banks it had cut off, forcing them to turn to the Greek Central Bank for more expensive loans. The Hellenic Hotel Federation, meanwhile, said tourism revenue was plummeting. Hotel reservations have dropped 30% to 50% in different parts of the country, the trade group said. Greek voters punished the major parties at the polls earlier this month for the harsh budget cuts imposed by the country\u2019s international lenders.  The election left no party able to form a government, creating deep uncertainty about Greece\u2019s ability to continue to meet the terms of its bailout package and therefore its debt obligations. The political deadlock is leading to concerns that Greece will not have a functioning government in place when it needs to make critical debt payments next month, which could in turn jeopardize its place in the eurozone, the group of 17 European Union countries that use the euro currency. And a crisis could quickly spread beyond Greece, one analyst warned. \u201cIf Greece exits the euro it won\u2019t be alone. Others will exit,\u201d said Paul Donovan, a global economist with UBS bank.  \u201cThere would be bank runs across multiple countries,\u201d he predicted. \u201cCitigroup, for example, may not be exposed to Greece, but it may be exposed to Portugal, Spain, France. \u2026 It may be exposed to a company that\u2019s exposed to France or exposed to exports to EU.\u201d  In a worst-case scenario, he said, \u201cyou\u2019re talking about widespread defaults in the corporate sector as well as the sovereign sector. It becomes very problematic.\u201d European leaders were united Wednesday in saying they want to help Greece stay in the euro. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she is working to keep Greece in the eurozone \u201cEurope needs to show solidarity and help, particularly with growth, unemployment and development,\u201d she said. Merkel, a champion of forcing governments to balance their budgets in order to promote stable economic growth in Europe, said she regrets the suffering of the Greek people in the face of harsh government budget cuts. \u201cIt\u2019s very bitter, obviously,\u201d she said of the austerity measures that have left some Greeks struggling to pay for food or utilities. But, she said, \u201cSacrifices had to be made. \u2026 I think these are necessary measures that had to be taken.\u201d The European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund have been pumping money into Greece to keep the country in the euro and able to pay its debts, but they have demanded that the Greek government slash spending to get the funds.

        "content": "Newly appointed Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said Thursday that France would not ratify a European pact on budget discipline if it does not include measures to boost growth. Moscovici said an \u201cambitious\u201d strategy for growth was needed, in an interview with CNN affiliate BFM-TV. The fiscal pact was signed by most European leaders late last year, and Germany, the economic powerhouse of the region, has said it is not up for renegotiation. Moscovici said French President Francois Hollande, sworn into office two days ago, was well aware of the gravity of the crisis facing Europe. But the new Socialist government would stick to the campaign promises made by Hollande, he said, including his pledge to incorporate a \u201cgrowth dimension\u201d into the fiscal compact. Holding its first Cabinet meeting Thursday, the government agreed to scrutinize public spending and review all Cabinet ministers\u2019 wages, spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem said. \u201cThe government is aware of the difficulties we face, in particular in terms of our public accounts,\u201d she told reporters after the meeting at the Elysee Palace.  Prime Minister Jean Marc-Ayrault has asked the French Court of Auditors for a report \u201con the state of our public accounts,\u201d she said. The Cabinet also agreed on a salary cut of 30% for ministers and the president, in line with a campaign promise by Hollande, Vallaud-Belkacem said.  The salary reduction would be retroactive to May 15, after the law is passed by the National Assembly in June, she said. The cut means the gross salary of the prime minister and president will drop from 21,300 euros to 14,910 euros ($18,970) a month, a government statement said. A minister will earn a gross wage of 9,940 euros ($12,650) a month, rather than the current 14,200 euros. Hollande stressed the need for the government to be efficient and to set a good example in its own practices, the statement said. The 17 men and 17 women who make up the government posed for a \u201cfamily photograph\u201d before getting down to business, BFM-TV reported. Speaking earlier as he took over as finance minister from Francois Baroin, Moscovici said the government\u2019s focus would be on the Greek crisis, the consolidation of the eurozone and a reorientation of European efforts in favor of growth. He added that he is a \u201ccommitted European.\u201d \u201cWe are conscious that we can do nothing alone. We must work together with all our partners, and above all with Germany and the European institutions,\u201d Moscovici said. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius also stressed his commitment to Europe on BFM-TV.  \u201cI feel deeply European, but we need a different Europe, a Europe that is much more concentrated on employment,\u201d he said. The pact, championed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, is designed to increase fiscal discipline and prevent a future crisis by ensuring that governments respect deficit rules and do not overspend. Hollande\u2019s first trip as president, made hours after his inauguration Tuesday, was to Berlin, where he met with Merkel to discuss the economy. \u201cI said that my wish is that growth is not an empty phrase, that it is something which, in reality, is happening,\u201d Hollande told reporters at a joint news conference with Merkel after the talks. \u201cBecause, without growth, we can\u2019t do whatever we want, we won\u2019t reach the goals which we want to \u2013 and to reduce the debt and deficit.\u201d He said the best solution would be to \u201cput everything on the table\u201d on May 23, when the region\u2019s leaders plan to meet next. Speaking earlier this month, Merkel said that she was in favor of growth but that it must be sustainable, rather than programs made on the back of more debt. Increased competitiveness is the key to sustainable growth, she said. Voters in France and Greece, where political turmoil continues after an election failed to produce a government, are the latest in Europe to express their unhappiness about the policy of austerity. As Greek politicians set a new election date Wednesday, Merkel said she regretted the suffering of the Greek people in the face of harsh government budget cuts. \u201cIt\u2019s very bitter, obviously,\u201d she said of the austerity measures that have left some Greeks struggling to pay for food or utilities. But, she said, \u201cSacrifices had to be made. \u2026 I think these are necessary measures that had to be taken.\u201d Merkel, a champion of forcing governments to balance their budgets in order to promote stable economic growth in Europe, did offer possible assistance to Greece. \u201cEurope needs to show solidarity and help, particularly with growth, unemployment and development,\u201d she said."

        "content": "The war crimes trial of former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic was suspended until further notice Thursday over the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose some evidence against Mladic, court spokeswoman Nerma Jelacic said. The abrupt suspension came only a day after the long-awaited trial began. Prosecutors had been planning to focus Thursday on the massacre of up to 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica, for which they accuse Mladic of responsibility. But the defense called for a halt to the trial after it found that the prosecution had not shown it all the evidence against Mladic. Under court rules, the defense has a right to study prosecution evidence before a trial begins. It was not clear what the evidence was or how long the delay would last, but it could be a matter of weeks. Lawyers will meet the judge Thursday afternoon to discuss how to proceed. The prosecution says that it did not show the defense all of its evidence, an apparent error that became evident when prosecutors began to lay out their case Wednesday. Mladic is accused of orchestrating a horrific campaign of ethnic cleansing during the bloody civil war that ripped apart Yugoslavia. The former general showed no remorse as his war crimes trial opened Wednesday, at one point even appearing to threaten victims in the court. He drew his hand across his neck as if cutting a throat while staring at victims of the war that introduced the phrase \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d  At other times, the man accused of being \u201cthe Butcher of Bosnia\u201d stared at them, fire in his eyes, and he once growled at the survivors. The 70-year-old former Bosnian Serb general has been indicted on 11 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in the 1992-95 war.  His trial is taking place at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague, Netherlands, a special court established to try those responsible for atrocities during the war.  On Wednesday, prosecutor Dermot Groome laid out details of the case against Mladic, saying that ethnic cleansing was not a byproduct of the war, but a specific aim of the Bosnian Serb leadership. He aimed to show that Mladic was directly responsible for atrocities carried out by his forces, who were fighting for control of land in ethnically mixed Bosnia. Sexual violence was a weapon of war, Groome said, describing a woman who said she had been raped more than 50 times, and women who were forced by Bosnian Serb forces to perform sex acts on members of their own families. Prosecutors will use survivor testimonies and video clips to make their case at a trial that is likely to last for months or years. Among those in the courtroom were the families of Srebrenica victims. \u201cVictims have waited nearly two decades to see Ratko Mladic in the dock,\u201d Param-Preet Singh, senior counsel in the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch, said ahead of the trial. \u201cHis trial should lay to rest the notion that those accused of atrocity crimes can run out the clock on justice.\u201d 2011: Ratko Mladic captured Mladic\u2019s trial began after a landmark war crimes ruling last month, when another international tribunal found former Liberian President Charles Taylor guilty of aiding and abetting war crimes in neighboring Sierra Leone\u2019s notoriously brutal civil war. Taylor got a final chance to address his court Wednesday as Mladic\u2019s trial opened, and he said he was \u201csaddened\u201d by a verdict that he portrayed as unfair. \u201cBoth trials are evidence of the growing international trend to hold perpetrators of atrocities to account, no matter how senior their position,\u201d Human Rights Watch said. Mladic eluded authorities for nearly 16 years until his capture in May 2011, when police burst into the garden of a small house in northern Serbia.  Europe\u2019s highest-ranking war crimes suspect was discovered standing against a wall in a utility room normally used for storing farm equipment, according to a government minister. Though he was carrying two handguns, he surrendered without a fight. He was extradited for trial in the Netherlands. But from day one in custody, he has exhibited defiance and appears not to have relinquished his visceral antagonism toward his enemies. Before the trial that started Wednesday, he also drew a finger across his throat in court, a gesture aimed at some of the Srebrenica widows. At other times, he disrupted proceedings by putting on a hat in the courtroom and refusing to enter a plea. He has sought delays in his trial and said he is in failing health. In July 1995, Mladic was in command of the Bosnian Serb army and led his soldiers into the town of Srebrenica. In the days that followed, the soldiers systematically slaughtered nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys. Bosnia peace negotiator Richard Holbrooke once described Mladic as \u201cone of those lethal combinations that history thrusts up occasionally \u2013 a charismatic murderer.\u201d  In the three decades leading up to the violent splintering of Yugoslavia, Mladic rose rapidly through the ranks of the Yugoslav army. In 1991, he served as a front-line commander spearheading Serb forces in a yearlong war with Croatia. By the time he took to Bosnia\u2019s battlefields, he had become a hero to many Serbs, seen as a defender of their dwindling fortunes. In May 1992, Bosnia\u2019s Serbian political leaders picked him to lead the assault on their Muslim enemies who clamored for independence. Robertson: Bosnia\u2019s future is tied to justice Mladic wasted no time galvanizing his heavily armed forces in a siege of Sarajevo, cutting the city off from the outside world. Serb forces pounded the city every day from higher ground positions, trapping Sarajevo\u2019s ill-prepared residents in the valley below. More than 10,000 people, mostly civilians, perished. Some observers conjured images of Sarajevo in describing Syrian attacks on the besieged city of Homs earlier this year. As the war ended in the fall of 1995, Mladic went on the run.  Shortly after Mladic was sent to The Hague last year, authorities nabbed former Croatian Serb rebel leader Goran Hadzic. He was the last Yugoslav war crimes suspect at large. Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic was arrested in 2008. And Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was arrested in 2001 but died before his trial could be completed."

        "content": "This year\u2019s NATO summit in Chicago is the biggest one ever, with some 60 countries expected to be in attendance and a host of issues crammed into two short days of meetings.  It is coming at a time when the alliance is under stress, with pressure to wrap up a war in Afghanistan, member countries with dwindling money reserves trying to help finance Afghanistan as it prepares to stand on its own, and questions on how strong the alliance really is in terms of its capabilities. While only two days long, the summit will entail a number of complex meetings and discussions that will not unfold in front of TV cameras for all to see. The meetings will take place in a large, highly secured convention hall outside downtown Chicago. So to help you sift through the bureaucratic talk that will be coming, we here at Security Clearance have put together a handy guide to navigating the NATO summit. NATO summit opens amid protests,  foiled terror plot What\u2019s the point? What does NATO really need to get out of this summit? It depends on what side of the ocean you are on. The Europeans will be looking at their pocketbooks and hammering out how they can pool resources and improve their military capabilities as they spend less on their militaries. But, as the primary leader in the war in Afghanistan, the United States needs to have the alliance come together and hammer out details on what it wants the future of Afghanistan to look like. The strategic partnership agreement signed by Afghanistan and the United States last month was nothing more than an outline, and U.S. officials have said they will use the summit to start defining what they want this relationship to look like. As the 2014 deadline for the war in Afghanistan to end draws nearer, the United States and NATO need to use these two days to figure out how a post-NATO Afghanistan will look and how it will be paid for. Why ordinary Afghans worry about NATO summit 2014 and beyond As U.S. President Barack Obama moves away from a counterinsurgency plan, the United States and NATO believe that the key for Afghanistan\u2019s success is to have a strong Afghan military and police force, neither of which is very strong at the moment. In order to build a stronger and more capable force, a good number of trainers will have to continue to work inside Afghanistan. You might be surprised at the number of U.S. troops left in Afghanistan for years to come, depending on the final number of Afghan security forces that will be put into place.  Also, keep an eye out for the number of actual U.S. troops that will be left to hunt Taliban and al Qaeda. That number, too, still has to be decided and will involve negotiations with the Afghan government, which is not keen on keeping actual combat troops within its borders. The Afghan troop numbers game As of now the top military commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John Allen, says they are assuming Afghan military and police forces will total 352,000 personnel. Others have suggested around 275,000 or 250,000. The final number may come down to how much it will cost to maintain such a force for the country and how much commitment money the United States will get from its NATO allies and partner countries.  The number of Afghan security forces will also be a factor in the decision on how many U.S. troops will remain in country to train those security forces. No tote bags, but pledges needed One of the priorities for the United States will be to start pressuring member countries to kick in for what will be a multibillion-dollar economic plan. The bill could be at least $4 billion per year and the United States could put in about a quarter or as much as a half of that total. About 23 NATO partner nations have also pledged to donate. But while purse strings are being tightened in this world of austerity, the United States would like to see NATO members put in their fair share.  Pakistan \u2026 the problem and solution Now that it has been invited to the NATO meeting, Pakistan is under pressure to reopen the supply lines into Afghanistan. The first step to watch is if Pakistan will accept the invitation to the conference. NATO is not really the crowd Pakistan wants to be around because discussions will almost certainly surround the lack of security in Pakistan\u2019s western tribal regions, where Taliban and al Qaeda militants hide and feed insurgents and weapons into Afghanistan. However, look for more details to come out on Pakistan agreeing to more military operations in the border area. Missile defense, Moscow takes offense Outside of Afghan talks, the other hot topic will be the continued push to build up missile defense systems around Europe to protect from a ballistic missile attack from Iran, something Russia is vehemently opposed to. U.S. officials have already said they do not expect a deal with Moscow this year, and Moscow is still pushing for an agreement by NATO that ensures the missile system would not be used against its missiles, something the United States and NATO will not do.  If NATO announces the placement of more systems around Europe, look for a blistering response from Moscow, which is already threatening arming its borders to counter, what it perceives as, a threat to its nuclear missile deterrent. Damascus dilemma While NATO has said there will be no Libya-style intervention in Syria because there is no legal authority, expect some conversations about Syria to take place even though it is not officially on the agenda.  Because Turkey is part of NATO, and it has some legitimate concerns along its border with Syria, Turkey could start to put heavy pressure on the alliance to make some kind of move. It is a long shot, but look to see if there are discussions on whether a NATO force could be created to protect safe havens along the Turkey-Syrian border. The NATO facebook New French President Francois Hollande: The new socialist leader will be attending his first head-of-state NATO conference just days into his job. Early thoughts, based on what he has said as a candidate, could be that he will remove French troops from Afghanistan earlier than his predecessor was planning \u2013 as early as the end of this year, not in 2013. It is not clear if he will go through with that plan, but it is worth keeping an eye on him to see how he builds his new NATO relationships, or not \u2013 especially if he announces while in Chicago that he is pulling his troops early. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari: While it has already been announced by the White House that Obama and Zardari will not meet in the Chicago summit if the Pakistani leader shows up, that does not mean Zardari will be sidelined. He knows that NATO members, especially the United States, will tread lightly in public so as to not irritate the Afghan neighbor, especially if the Pakistani government is still deliberating whether to open the crucial NATO supply lines. Zardari could also take advantage of the United States stepping on diplomatic eggshells and make some public demands on NATO and the United States. But he has to show up to do that. Russian President Vladimir Putin: Some analysts believe that Putin is not sincere in his saying he decided not to attend the Chicago summit because he has to assemble a new government, especially as the new French leader will come days after his first day on the job.  The real excuses could be that as the key to al-Assad\u2019s ouster, he does not want to face tough issues on Syria, and that he does not have much assistance to offer the West on Iran. He will be leaving that job to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who will be attending in his stead. But expect the stone-faced but fiery leader to blast NATO from afar on its European missile defense program, which he believes is threatening his country\u2019s nuclear deterrent. U.S. Gen. John Allen, commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan: Allen, who has overseen the transition from counterinsurgency operations to the new train-and-equip strategy in Afghanistan, has also voiced concern about withdrawing troops too quickly over the final two years. But Allen could be getting a promotion.  U.S. officials tell CNN the president is expected to nominate Allen in early 2013 to lead U.S. European Command and to be the supreme allied commander of NATO. An announcement could be made as early as in Chicago that Allen will be moved from his Kabul post. The move would keep Allen involved in Afghanistan, through NATO, but make room for a commander more suited to the shift to counterterrorism and special operations. Allen also gets to have some fun. He\u2019s scheduled to throw a ceremonial pitch at a Chicago Cubs home game during the summit.  Afghan President Hamid Karzai: Karzai will leave office in 2014, the same year all U.S. combat forces are due out. He has been a thorn in the side of the United States for years now, but don\u2019t expect a victory dance from the United States or NATO when Karzai\u2019s time is up.  He undoubtedly will ensure the United States and NATO will not walk all over him in his final two years by leaving his mark on the ongoing strategic partnership agreement negotiations. "

        "content": "Energy giant Total said Wednesday it was able to plug a well that had been leaking gas for seven weeks at a North Sea platform. Nearly 240 people were evacuated from the Elgin platform and an adjacent drilling rig after the leak was reported March 25, about 150 miles (240 km) east of the Scottish city of Aberdeen.  Workers Tuesday began pumping heavy mud into the Elgin platform well, plugging the leak 12 hours later, according to Total. The well will be monitored to ensure the operation was a complete success. Total\u2019s statement did not indicate when production will resume. At first, gas leaked at an estimated rate of 2 kilograms per second, which translates to about 200,000 cubic meters per day. That was progressively reduced to .5 kilograms per second. "

        "content": "Seventeen years after the end of the war, Ratko Mladic gives the impression he is still on the battlefield in what was once Yugoslavia, staring down his enemy, glowering across the courtroom. Even gesticulating death threats. What the former Bosnian Serb military commander hopes to gain and exactly what he is trying to defend are unclear. He may be the only one who expects an outcome other than guilty. He seems almost eager to fight all comers to the bitter end. The women of Srebrenica are in the Hague too. All these years later, they stand before him, with international justice on their side.  These women \u2013 the widows, mothers, victims of one of the worst atrocities since World War II \u2013 occupy the moral high ground. They will not be moved. Mladic shows no remorse But they have sunk so low in despair and desolation that even a bone unearthed in a mass grave raises spirits \u2013 maybe something tangible from a loved one, something to cling to, a hint that truth and justice may not escape them. Almost 1,000 miles away, most of Bosnia goes about its business with little talk of the war; life goes on. If a question is unwittingly asked by an outsider, it is met with grace, but it hangs awkwardly over the conversation, like an unwanted guest at a dinner table everyone would rather not be there. So back here, in a courtroom in the Netherlands, it is the women of Srebrenica who have the moral weight to slug it out. Eight thousand murders in Srebrenica alone. This is what gives their families such power: There are so many of them. They\u2019ve become a force Mladic must reckon with, by proxy of course. The international community, in the form of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), controls this courtroom battlefield. They are such a force, in fact, that the whole country must listen, too, awkward or not. No amount of reconciliation \u2013 not that there is a lot \u2013 can really happen until the women of Srebrenica and their families get the justice they are looking for. Can their moral high ground be shared with other Bosnians? Can the country untether itself from the weight of this anchor on progress? If so, then a bigger battle will have been won in the Hague. Ratko Mladic: Villain to many, hero to others Will a guilty verdict in the battle still playing out in the courtroom here be enough to win \u2013 Mladic vanquished to jail, banished from the battlefield by a long sentence? If not, then no prison sentence will bring back the dead, rectify the wrongs, and Bosnians hopeful of a better future will be hostage to their history and to those who more than anyone deserve a better future, the families of Srebrenica."

        "content": "Confusion, fear, frustration \u2013 emotions are running high among Greece\u2019s people as they face the prospect of new elections next month and massive uncertainty over the country\u2019s economic future. No party was able to form a coalition government after the vote earlier this month, and there is no guarantee that the elections set for June 17 will result in political stability either. Greeks set election date amid fears Meanwhile, the idea that Greece might leave the euro, the single currency used by 17 nations, is gaining traction despite the latest vows of support from European leaders, and the Greek people continue to suffer under painful austerity measures. Alex Tsompanidis, a 20-year-old medical student from Athens, told CNN that the current crisis is affecting every aspect of life, even people\u2019s friendships. \u201cI can honestly say that the fragile political situation in Greece has scared almost everyone I know,\u201d he said.  \u201cPeople have been considering withdrawing their bank deposits, if they haven\u2019t done this already. Most importantly, however, this recent political turmoil \u2013 and the elections to follow \u2013 has put a burden on everyone\u2019s interactions and everyday life,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople in Greece are now divided. I keep arguing with my friends concerning our voting preferences. Misinformation is rampant, and everyone is critical of everybody else.\u201d Greek President Karolos Papoulias raised the specter of a run on banks Tuesday after the central bank reported that Greeks pulled about 800 million euros out of the banking system on Monday. \u201cThere is, of course, no panic, but there is fear that could develop into panic,\u201d Papoulias said, describing what the central bank governor told him.  English language newspaper Athens News said its reporters had been out to banks in the past two days and seen no signs that a \u201crush\u201d was on. Journalist Thanasis Trompoukis, based in Athens, also rejected the idea that his fellow citizens are panicking, but he said many fear for the future. Woman \u2018sacrificed for a future that never came\u2019 Part of the problem is confusion over whether Greece really risks being kicked out of the euro zone if it does not abide by stringent European bailout terms because every politician gives a different answer, he said. \u201cWe hear so many things and we don\u2019t know where the truth lies,\u201d Trompoukis said. \u201cNow we wait for new elections and, for sure, people think that neither PASOK nor New Democracy, the two major parties, can help the country. And we are sure that the measures that Europe asks us to take will not solve the problems for Greece (either).\u201d Those austerity measures include the tax increases and painful cuts to wages, services and pensions that have angered many voters and sent them flocking to back parties such as the leftist Syriza coalition, rather than the more moderate PASOK and New Democracy. The ensuing political deadlock is leading to fears that Greece will not have a government in place when it needs to make critical debt payments, which could in turn jeopardize its place in the euro zone. Business leaders prepare for \u2018Grexit\u2019 At the same time, its people ask how much hardship they can be expected to take. \u201cHere in Greece many people are really poor right now,\u201d said Trompoukis, pointing out that for many workers salaries have dropped by more than a third over the past year, but costs have not. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the money to cover their basic needs, such as to buy food or pay for their utilities or their phones, and every day more and more (people) get in that situation. So if you don\u2019t have money to buy food, you\u2019re not worried about the European future of the country \u2013 you are worried about your survival.\u201d Greek media reports reflect the pain many people are feeling, as well as the sense that they are being unfairly asked to pay for a crisis not of their making. \u201cThe country will once again test its endurance limits, as going back to the polls is unavoidable,\u201d the daily Kathimerini newspaper said Wednesday, as the date for a new election was announced. I Avgi, a daily left-leaning newspaper published in Athens, suggested the international community is trying to shock the Greek people into electing a government that will stick to the bailout deal despite the painful austerity measures attached. \u201cThe bailout forces and troika create hell for 30 days in order \u2018to correct\u2019 the vote of the people,\u201d are the opening words of one its main stories. Turnout was much lower than usual in the May 6 election, said Marios Efthymiopoulos, president of the Thessaloniki-based think tank Strategy International, likely reflecting people\u2019s disillusionment with the system. He says his country is in urgent need of a stable, credible government to restore confidence and let investors know that Greece is \u201copen for business.\u201d Greeks will consider themselves European whether they are in the euro zone or not, said Efthymiopoulos, a former visiting scholar at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. But most people do not want Greece to leave the euro zone, despite the huge debt it must carry to stay in the club. \u201cThe problem is, how will you repay that debt? How will you emerge as a winner from that debt? That\u2019s not easy to do,\u201d Efthymiopoulos said. He also warns that if Greece were to quit the euro and return to a national currency, such as the drachma, the move would result in years of turmoil and cost money the nation does not have. Efthymiopoulos wants to see more young people in politics, bringing fresh ideas and a more outward-looking perspective. Reform of the country\u2019s laws and electoral system is also needed, he said, if long-term stability is to be achieved. In the meantime, no one will listen to the interim prime minister sworn in Wednesday, he warns, and Greece will continue to flounder until a government is convincingly elected that can win the trust of its own people and build alliances abroad. \u201cWe have no allies whatsoever,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not credible and nobody trusts us \u2013 and that is unfortunate because some of us are trustworthy, and now we need to prove that.\u201d Melina Grigoriadou, whose job with an export firm means she often travels outside Greece, said she is frustrated by the unflattering views of her country she hears elsewhere. \u201cWe are not a nation of lazy people or thieves or crooks,\u201d she said. \u201cAs in all the countries around the world, there are people who work hard (for low wages), or people who beg for a job to feed their family, or people that fear about the unknown future.\u201d The fault lies with the corrupt system presided over by PASOK and New Democracy for decades, Grigoriadou said, not the ordinary people who are  suffering as a result of politicians\u2019 self-interest. \u201cGreeks didn\u2019t vote thinking of their EU future, but it was a vote of anger against our political system, our politicians who behaved to us all these years like we are their \u2018clients,\u2019\u201d she said. Looking ahead to the elections on June 17, the mother of two says Greeks need to keep their country set on a European course. \u201cI can\u2019t say that I am optimistic for what is going to happen, but I know that to the extent that I can, I will try to influence those of my friends who voted angrily the previous time now to give (it) a second thought,\u201d she said. \u201cI am a European; I want to continue being in the EU. I want the euro currency, and I will vote now in new elections.\u201d Tsompanidis, studying medicine at the University of Athens, says many people struggle to know what to make of German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s comments on Greece, or the speeches of their own politicians. But, he said, \u201ctwo things are certain: Nobody wants Greece to exit the euro, and everyone can see that the financial situation in Greece has deteriorated rapidly with no light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d Tsompanidis said he has taken part in some of the many anti-austerity protests that have filled the capital\u2019s streets in recent years. Many people\u2019s anger is fueled by the fact that the country\u2019s huge debt is a result of government overspending and corruption rather than private debt, he said. Meanwhile, those who do pay taxes, in a country where tax evasion is a big problem, have to shoulder even more of the burden. Like many students of his generation, Tsompanidis anticipates that after graduation he will have to leave Greece \u2013 where more than half of those under age 25 were unemployed as of January, according to European Commission figures \u2013 to seek work elsewhere. Journalist Trompoukis, 32, said four of his friends have left Greece to find work in recent months. \u201cIf you asked me two years ago, I would never believe that so many young people would leave Greece and go to London or Germany or other European countries,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad.\u201d Tsompanidis believes that while the tough austerity measures imposed on his country may have kept the banks and lenders afloat, it has not help restore investor confidence in Greece, \u201cinstead plunging the country in internal bankruptcy and misery.\u201d And he is also upset by the increasingly negative view of Greece that many overseas seem to hold. \u201cI am very distraught that the world believes Greeks are lazy and useless. I am very disappointed to watch everyone lose faith in Greece and mistake our inadequate political establishment with everyone else in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want our European \u2018partners\u2019 to help us restore growth and the prospects of the economy, but nobody is willing anymore, and that is a disheartening realization.\u201d"

        "content": "UEFA president Michel Platini is confident German Chancellor Angela Merkel would attend the final of Euro 2012 in Ukraine \u2013 if Germany reach the tournament\u2019s showpiece in Kiev on July 1. Together with European Union commissioners and several other Western politicians, Merkel has threatened to boycott the month-long tournament, which Ukraine is co-hosting with Poland next month, in sympathy with jailed Ukrainian opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about the situation,\u201d Platini told CNN in an exclusive interview ahead of Saturday\u2019s Champions League final between Bayern Munich and Chelsea in the German city. \u201cThe politicians they are in their role and the Ukrainians they are in their role. I\u2019m in my role and that is not to do politics, it\u2019s not to do religion and not to interfere in everything. \u201cThat means they can say what they want \u2013 we continue to organize the Euro. If Germany is in final of the Euro I would be sure that Madame Merkel would come to the final.\u201d Such a scenario \u2013 and it is very possible given Germany are one of the tournament favorites \u2013 would represent something of a u-turn for Merkel given earlier this month she told the Bundestag, the lower house of the German Parliament, that in Ukraine and Belarus \u201cpeople are still suffering under dictatorship and repression.\u201d No regrets While admitting UEFA had taken a risk in giving Euro 2012 to Poland and Ukraine, Platini insisted he had no regrets about the European governing body\u2019s decision to award the tournament to the two Eastern European neighbors. \u201cFour years ago when all the slides were red, red, red, red, red \u2013 stadium, roads, accommodation was red, red, red, red it was not easy. OK we took the risk but I say it was a good risk.\u201d As well as dealing with the political fall-out from Ukraine\u2019s strained relationship with the West, UEFA is implementing a set of financial regulations \u2013 Financial Fair Play (FFP) - that are designed to compel most teams to live within their means. The FFP rules apply now but will come fully into force in 2014. But this new stringent financial regime has raised the question as to whether UEFA would prevent a big-spending team like Manchester City, which has incurred large debts after spending up to $1.5B on winning the English Premier League (EPL) for the first time this season, from competing in the Champions League. \u201cI\u2019m happy for them,\u201d said Platini, as he congratulated City on their title success. \u201cBut they will know what we will do. And if they are in the Financial Fair Play they will play our competition but we will look at them like we will look at everyone else. \u201cWe prepare everything with the clubs \u2013 we gave them four years to prepare something for the future,\u201d added Platini. \u201cWe will never go back.\u201d Technology opposed The former Nancy and Juventus midfielder and French captain, who led France when they won the European Championships in 1984, remains equally resolute in his opposition to FIFA\u2019s likely introduction of goal-line technology in the summer. The EPL wants to introduce goal-line technology as early as next season if football\u2019s rule-makers \u2013 The International Football Association Board (IFAB) \u2013 sanction its use in July. \u201cI\u2019m against the technology,\u201d said Platini. \u201cIf you say OK to goal-line technology, then it is offside technology, then penalty area technology, and we stop the football. I want human people \u2013 it\u2019s easy. I understand the fans because they want justice but with an additional referee we have the same justice.\u201d FIFA president Sepp Blatter has indicated he is in favor of goal-line technology and would like to see it in place for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, but Platini has not given up all hope that the Swiss may still change his mind. \u201cI am football, he is political.\u201d said Platini. \u201cHe changes his mind. He said last year in the IFAB never technology, never. This year he changed, he\u2019s says let\u2019s go technology. I hope next year he will say no technology.\u201d Looking ahead to Saturday\u2019s showpiece event between Chelsea and Bayern, Platini insisted that that best two teams had reached the final, despite the widely held view that their respective semifinal opponents \u2013 Barcelona and Real Madrid \u2013 are Europe\u2019s strongest teams. \u201cCould be, but the result is there \u2013 it\u2019s Bayern Munich against Chelsea. I didn\u2019t see Barcelona be better than Chelsea and I didn\u2019t see Real Madrid be better than Bayern in these games,\u201d said the UEFA  president. Surprising season \u201cEverything was surprising \u2013 the non-qualification of some of the English teams to the second round, the fact that Chelsea and Bayern were not favorites for the semifinals and they beat Barcelona and Real Madrid. It has been incredible year for the legend of the cup.\u201d Next season will be the 20th anniversary of the Champions League, which was formerly known as the European Cup. Asked to single out his favorite finals, Platini picked Liverpool\u2019s win over AC Milan 2005 and Barcelona\u2019s triumph in 2011. \u201cIstanbul, was an incredible game for Liverpool against Milan and last year\u2019s final between Barcelona and Manchester United was a great, great game with a great atmosphere at the stadium.\u201d   "

        "content": "Former England defender Sol Campbell has told CNN World Sport he is baffled by England coach Roy Hodgson\u2019s decision to omit Rio Ferdinand from the forthcoming Euro 2012 tournament. Hodgson insisted he had decided to exclude the 33-year-old Manchester United center-back from his 23-man squad for purely footballing reasons. But Campbell, who won 73 caps and played in three World Cup campaigns for his England, thinks Hodgson\u2019s call has more to do with off-field concerns. Former England captain John Terry has been included in the squad, despite awaiting trial on charges he racially abused Rio\u2019s brother Anton during an English Premier League match in October. Terry denies the allegations. Did Manchester City win the title \u2013 or did United lose it? Terry was stripped of the captaincy over the affair, leading to the resignation of Fabio Capello, and Campbell is convinced the ongoing court case involving the Chelsea player was a factor in Hodgson\u2019s decision. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s gone on,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t know the conversation Roy Hodgson has had with John Terry or Rio Ferdinand.  That\u2019s going to probably be kept quiet.   \u201cBut I think it did play a small, or a big part in it, because you\u2019re away for four to six weeks together, (Roy is) probably thinking, maybe something might happen at the camp. \u201cBut you can\u2019t say for football reasons Rio Ferdinand shouldn\u2019t be going because he\u2019s experienced, he knows how to play football, he\u2019s an excellent defender, he\u2019s been fantastic for his club and country, especially in the last three months.\u201d Hodgson said his conversations with both players would remain private though he did reveal Ferdinand was gracious and wished England well for the competition. Of Terry Hodgson, the former Liverpool manager, said: \u201cI realized that when I selected him there would be people who would raise eyebrows but that\u2019s the decision that I\u2019ve made, that\u2019s the decision I shall live with.\u201d  Manchester City sorry for Tevez\u2019s \u2018Fergie R.I.P.\u2019 banner Ferdinand took to social networking site Twitter to express his disappointment at missing out, saying: \u201cAbsolutely loved playing for England. To say I\u2019m gutted is an understatement of the highest order.\u201d Campbell believes Ferdinand\u2019s vast experience on the international stage will prove a big miss for Hodgson\u2019s side. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cHe\u2019s played the last 10, 12 games for Manchester United, he\u2019s played excellently, he\u2019s fit as a fiddle. \u201cYou need all your experienced players in a tournament like this. If you want younger players who are coming in and learning their way around international football, start with them in a campaign, at the beginning of your qualifying.   \u201cStart not at the end, when you need the most experienced players at the tournament.

        "content": "They say a week is a long time in politics. In today\u2019s febrile world of finance, it\u2019s a lifetime.  Europe\u2019s leaders may soon learn that lesson the hard way if they continue to dodge the question on everyone\u2019s lips: What to do if Greece is pushed out of the eurozone? No stranger to unfortunate soubriquets herself, Angela Merkel has repeatedly refused to address the matter of a Greek exit \u2013 or \u201cGrexit,\u201d as it has been dubbed.  This week, she cited \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d as her logic for skirting the issue.  Either way, the bosses of some of the eurozone\u2019s biggest companies have decided they can\u2019t afford the luxury of being caught short. With a staff of more than 90,000 to consider and operations in more than 80 countries to oversee, Shell CEO Peter Voser has admitted that he must plan for what the markets say is an increasingly plausible outcome to a tragedy well into its third year. Speaking on CNN\u2019s \u201cWorld Business Today,\u201d Voser said that \u201cone obviously has made provisions\u201d at this stage. \u201cI still see it as a low likelihood scenario, but we have done our work over the last few months to prepare ourselves,\u201d he said. As high as the stakes are for one of the world\u2019s biggest oil companies, the stakes for heads of government, like Merkel, are even higher. About 320 million people use the euro daily, and as the German chancellor knows, the integrity of the union is crucial for confidence in its economy \u2013 an economy that just flatlined in the first quarter.  This invites the question: If it\u2019s so obvious to business leaders, why do Europe\u2019s elected leaders still shy away from the subject?  Charles Proctor, partner at the law firm Edwards Wildman, thinks he knows the answer.  Having spent the past two years pondering the possibility of a eurozone member dropping out, Proctor says the existing legal framework doesn\u2019t offer a formal escape route.  The European Union treaty does give Greece the extreme option of backing out of the EU but not out of its monetary system in itself. This means any negotiations would have to be kept quiet.  \u201cOne assumes that a certain amount of contingency work has been done,\u201d Proctor said, \u201cjust that it has been kept secret against the political backdrop that the eurozone must hold together.\u201d Greeks set election date amid possibility of bank panic That view is echoed by former EU Commissioner and one-time UK Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson. \u201cI think it would be better to discuss this behind closed doors. Otherwise, it would create yet more uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cIn theory you might say: \u2018Its face doesn\u2019t fit, it\u2019s not performing in the way that others need it to do, its politics are falling apart, its people are miserable \u2026 so why not let it go out?\u2019 But the consequences of that would shake Greece for many, many years to come.\u201d Since Greece went to the polls May 6, as many as six rate-setters from the European Central Bank have openly debated the pros and cons of a common currency minus one troublesome member.  The word \u201cGrexit\u201d has made the front page of tabloids and broadsheets in non-eurozone nations like Britain for two straight days. But bookmaker Paddy Power has cut the odds it is offering on Greece being the first out of the eurozone to 1-in-10 from 1-in-8. Lex van Dam, co-founder of Hampstead Capital, says it\u2019s a \u201creally tough call.\u201d He says Greece\u2019s chances of keeping the euro are 50-50 and hinge less on political goodwill than financial support from the European Central Bank.  \u201cSaving Greece means throwing good money after bad, but not saving Greece means possible huge and fatal capital outflows from the periphery as well,\u201d he said.  If that\u2019s the case, van Dam said, the losses incurred by the central bank could threaten the very institutions set up to safeguard the euro. Which means keeping Greece inside the eurozone could mean a \u201cno euros zone\u201d for its neighbors further down the line. So can the tide be turned?  Proctor reckons the dam has burst.  \u201cFor many years it used to be taboo, but so many people are talking about it, it\u2019s not a possibility that can be ignored anymore,\u201d he said. Either way, lawyers, hedge fund managers and chief executives are discussing the euro area\u2019s monetary fate, even if those in charge of its member nations are not. "

        "content": "Roger Federer\u2019s late decision to compete at the Rome Masters paid dividends as he breezed past Carlos Berlocq on Wednesday. The 16-time grand slam champion moved up to number two in the world above Spain\u2019s Rafael Nadal after winning the Madrid Open on Sunday and only opted to play in Italy on the morning of his second round match. But the Swiss duly dispatched his Argentinean opponent 6-4 6-3 in his latest bid to claim a first Rome crown, having been beaten in the 2003 and 2006 finals. He will play Juan Carlos Ferrero next. \u201cI have a good win under my belt and I might be No. 3 next week, but that doesn\u2019t matter for me and Rafa,\u201d Federer told the ATP Tour\u2019s official website.  \u201cI know it is an interesting time right now and that there is a lot to talk about rankings. I know that I have a shot until the U.S. Open with the rankings and we will see.\u201d With a busy schedule that includes the French Open, Wimbledon, the Olympics and the U.S. Open fast approaching, Federer said he was close to giving this week\u2019s event a miss. But after capturing his 74th career ATP title in Madrid, Federer told reporters a two-day break after Sunday\u2019s final afforded him sufficient time to recover. \u201cI only decided today after practice this morning,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to see how I felt and that nothing major was bothering me. I\u2019m happy I felt good out there, but I\u2019m going round-by-round. \u201cWe are ahead of a long summer, this is the start of many events in a row and potentially a lot of five-setters. I needed to make sure that I took a good  decision.\u201d Nadal bounced back from his third round exit in Madrid last week with a 6-1 7-5 victory over Germany\u2019s Florian Mayer to set up a clash with fellow Spaniard Marcel Granollers in round three. Elsewhere, the 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro successfully negotiated his way past Russia\u2019s Mikhail Youzhny, winning 6-4 6-2 to set up a clash with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Tomas Berdych, who was beaten by Federer in the Madrid final, enjoyed a comfortable 6-4 6-1 victory over Poland\u2019s Lukasz Kubot. There were also victories for Spain\u2019s Nicolas Almagro, who beat American qualifier Sam Querrey 7-5 6-2, and Argentina\u2019s Juan Monaco, who beat Radek Stepanek, from the Czech Republic, 6-4 6-2. In the women\u2019s draw, No. 3 seed Agnieszka Radwanska, from Poland, was stunned by Czech Petra Cetkovska, who won their encounter 6-4 4-6 6-1. Former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki is also out after she retired during her clash with Spain\u2019s Anabel Medina Garrigues due to breathing difficulties. Serena Williams, who won the Madrid Open last week, defeated Russia\u2019s Nadia Petrova 4-6 6-2 6-3 while No. 5 seed Samantha Stosur edged out Sara Errani, of Italy, 6-3 7-5. There were also victories for China\u2019s Li Na ahead of the defense of her French Open title, and Germany\u2019s Angelique Kerber."

        "content": "We\u2019re at a soup kitchen in a shabby back street in Paris, next to the canal Saint Martin, near the Jaur\u00e8s metro stop. Hundreds of homeless people are queuing up for some hot food and a coffee. Most of them are from Asia; many from Afghanistan and Bangladesh.   Among them are dozens of children, their grimy faces, vacant stares and worn clothes redolent of months on the road. Some have walked hundreds of miles to escape the violence of Afghanistan.  They have been told to get to Jaur\u00e8s metro in Paris and they will be looked after. Often the people-traffickers dump them here, feeling they have fulfilled their part of the bargain: to get them to the West.  We talked to two 14-year-olds who don\u2019t want to go on camera. They had arrived that day from Italy, after traveling through Iran, Turkey and Greece.  The story they told us is typical: Their families paid thousands of dollars to send them to the west in the hands of smugglers. The journey was extremely perilous. They traveled in the backs of trucks, cars and at times walking across mountain ranges; it took them nine months to get to Paris.  Like many of the children we spoke to, they risked frostbite during their dangerous traversing of mountains in Iran and Turkey. They claimed Iranian border guards shot at them as they crossed the frontier. But despite of the risks they kept going \u2013 lured by the promises of lucrative jobs in France.  The reality when they arrive is very different. Most of them are aged between 14 and 18 years old. Theoretically the French state has a duty of care for unaccompanied minors, but these teenagers must prove their age. Often they don\u2019t have the documents necessary to show their age, and so they are left to sleep on the streets.  One charity, France Terre d\u2019Asile (France: Haven) is trying to help, but it is hopelessly overwhelmed.  The group estimates that some 6,000 foreign children arrive illegally in France each year \u2013 most turn up in Paris expecting to be able to work to send money home to their families. That is, of course, illegal, so there are faced with entering the black market or surviving on handouts.  The lucky ones may get a place in a reception center run by a charity. We filmed at one hostel which has just 25 beds. When we were there, 45 children turned up needing somewhere to sleep. It was cold and raining and only the youngest were admitted. The rest were forced to once again sleep on the streets.  Mohammed is typical: He spent three months sleeping in a park before finally getting a hotel room provided by the French state, once he was able to prove he was 16 years old. He was lucky: his sister was able to fax a copy of his birth certificate.  But many of his friends are still sleeping outside, because they can\u2019t prove their age. He tells me about the frequent fights between different ethnics groups \u2013 Tajiks beaten by Hazaras, Pashtuns clashing with Bangladeshis. Muggings, drug abuse and the ever present sex-trade were all daily risks for him.  His story is a microcosm of the problems that have consumed Afghanistan for three decades: He was orphaned by war and disease \u2013 his father was killed by the Taliban, his mother died of tuberculosis. His uncle physically abused him for years until finally his brother-in-law agreed to lend him $6,000 so he could buy his passage to the west, but on arriving in Paris, his dreams of a job and a new life were quickly shattered.  Now he has begun to make a start on improving his life, learning French, and getting his first taste of the internet.  His prospects remain bleak, but at least he has a bed to sleep in each night \u2013 unlike so many of the other Afghan children who are surviving on the streets of Paris. "

        "content": "At the start of the 2012 Formula One season, with a driver pairing that comprised of a virtual rookie and a former world champion who had been out of the sport for two years, little was expected of Lotus. But the combination of 2007 title winner Kimi Raikkonen and Romain Grosjean, whose only previous experience in F1 was seven unspectacular races for the team in 2009, has flourished, collecting 84 points from the season\u2019s opening five races. The highlight of a promising start was a double podium finish for Lotus in Bahrain, a result which contributed to Raikkonen\u2019s current position of fourth in the early-season drivers\u2019 standings, with Grosjean eighth ahead of the next race in Monaco on May 27. The team\u2019s on-track success has been played out against a backdrop of financial upheaval, with owner Genie Capital having terminated a lucrative longterm sponsorship deal with Group Lotus \u2013 owned by the Malaysian car manufacturer Proton. The UK-based outfit will, however, continue to race under one of the most famous names in motorsport. Fire mars Maldonado\u2019s first grand prix win Team principal Eric Boullier insists that there are sufficient sponsorship deals to plug the monetary gap created by Group Lotus\u2019 departure. \u201cWe have not lost our title sponsor \u2013 not in the real sense of the word lost. We have decided to end the contract, or the agreement, we had with them at the middle of last year,\u201d Boullier told the official F1 website.  \u201cWe wanted to change our strategy, and actually we are, if I may say so, wealthier than we were before. We have bigger budgets this year and will keep the name Lotus under a license agreement.  \u201cWe have signed some big names as sponsors. If you look at my shirt, there are two new names on it. We have been able to sign deals with Unilever and Microsoft, which are two really big names.\u201d Boullier said the Bahrain race was a fitting tribute to the work put in by the team \u2013 who previously competed under the Renault name. Latest F1 standings \u201cIt was a fantastic reward. We haven\u2019t performed in that mode since 2006,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe fact is we were expecting to deliver something after the first three races, but we had to come to terms with the little glitches we had. When that was done \u2013 voila \u2013 it finally worked.\u201d Boullier said there was a good relationship building between experienced former Ferrari driver Raikkonen, who is is in his 10th F1 campaign, and Frenchman Grosjean \u2013 a 26-year-old who has yet to complete a full season. \u201cObviously Kimi, with his experience, his character and personality, tends to have a certain degree of leadership. But in fact it is not leadership but probably more attention,\u201d Boullier said.  Ferrari pile pressure on Massa \u201cOn the other hand Romain is digging a little place for himself nicely and is getting a lot of respect every weekend from the team.  \u201cYou must not forget that Kimi has done something in the range of 160 grands prix and Romain has just finished his 12th grand prix this weekend.\u201d Boullier said the 32-year-old Raikkonen, who collected another podium finish at last weekend\u2019s Spanish Grand Prix, has adapted well to life at Lotus\u2019 Enstone headquarters. \u201cKimi doesn\u2019t like PR, doesn\u2019t like media. So why should we bother him with it? Sure we need a balance between his demands and the requests from our sponsors,\u201d Boullier said.  \u201cBut he knows that we care very much about his schedule and try to minimize his obligations. That\u2019s it. He is a racer so he races for winning and hardly cares about the rest!  \u201cKimi is like a wild animal and you have to let him run the way he wants to go. We don\u2019t have to tell him what he has to do because he is a professional and we want him to deliver on track first.\u201d"

        "content": "Greece will hold new elections on June 17, state media reported Wednesday, amid a political and economic crisis that could have effects far beyond the country\u2019s borders. News of the election date came as Greeks pulled hundreds of millions of euros out of the banking system amid fears that the country will not be able to stay in the European Union\u2019s single currency. Just 10 days ago, Greeks voters punished the major parties for harsh budget cuts, leaving no party able to form a government. A caretaker administration led by a senior judge will run the country until the new vote.  Interim Prime Minister Panagiotis Pikrammenos was sworn in Wednesday. The president\u2019s office said Cabinet ministers will take their oaths of office Thursday morning. The political deadlock is leading to fears that Greece will not have a government in place when it needs to make critical debt payments, which could in turn jeopardize its place in the eurozone, the group of 17 European Union countries that use the euro currency. And a Greek crisis could spread, one analyst warned. \u201cIf Greece exits the euro it won\u2019t be alone. Others will exit,\u201d said Paul Donovan, a global economist with UBS bank.  \u201cThere would be bank runs across multiple countries,\u201d he predicted. \u201cCitigroup, for example, may not be exposed to Greece, but it may be exposed to Portugal, Spain, France. \u2026 It may be exposed to a company that\u2019s exposed to France, or exposed to exports to EU.\u201d  In a worst-case scenario, he said, \u201cyou\u2019re talking about widespread defaults in the corporate sector as well as the sovereign sector. It becomes very problematic.\u201d Even so, most major European stock markets ended the day Wednesday virtually unchanged. European leaders were united Wednesday in saying they want to help Greece stay in the euro. As Greek politicians met Wednesday to set the new election date, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she regrets the suffering of the Greek people in the face of harsh government budget cuts. \u201cIt\u2019s very bitter, obviously,\u201d she said of the austerity measures that have left some Greeks struggling to pay for food or utilities. But, she said, \u201cSacrifices had to be made. \u2026 I think these are necessary measures that had to be taken.\u201d Merkel, a champion of forcing governments to balance their budgets in order to promote stable economic growth in Europe, did offer possible assistance to Greece. \u201cEurope needs to show solidarity and help, particularly with growth, unemployment and development,\u201d she said. The head of the European Union\u2019s executive body, the European Commission, said Wednesday that Greece is \u201cpart of our family,\u201d and that the EU will do what it can to keep Greece in the euro and the union. But the final decision has to come from the Greek people, Jose Manuel Barroso said. \u201cWe are fully aware that the present situation is asking a lot of the Greek people, with many sacrifices. But this is a result of policies made in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cThe program for Greece is the least difficult of all the difficult alternatives. The problems it addresses are real,\u201d he warned. Merkel and Barroso spoke after Greeks withdrew hundreds of millions of euros from banks, prompting the president of Greece\u2019s central bank to warn that panic is possible, but is not taking place. Greeks pulled about 800 million euros out of the banking system Monday, President Karolos Papoulias said. He said he had spoken to Central Bank Governor George Provopoulos about it. \u201cThere is, of course, no panic, but there is fear that could develop into panic,\u201d Papoulias said, describing what the bank governor told him. \u201cHe also said that the strength of banks is very weak at the moment.\u201d The Greek debt crisis threatens the stability of the European Union\u2019s single currency. Europe is worried that Greece could fail to make debt payments as early as next month, which could force the country out of the euro. Merkel said she is working to keep Greece in the eurozone, but she refused to be drawn into talk about what would happen if Greece did not meet its debt obligations. The head of the European Central Bank echoed Merkel\u2019s remarks. \u201cI want to state that our strong preference is that Greece will continue to stay in the euro area,\u201d Mario Draghi said in a speech in Frankfurt on Wednesday. The European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund have been pumping money into Greece to keep the country in the euro, but they have demanded that the Greek government slash spending to get the funds.  Radical leftist leader Alexis Tsipras, whose Syriza party reaped the benefits of voter frustration with the austerity measures, urged Greeks on Tuesday to continue resisting \u201cthe parties of the bailout.\u201d \u201cThey asked us to leave the country without any hope,\u201d he said, arguing that the May 6 election had made the terms of the bailout \u201cnull and void.\u201d New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras, meanwhile, said his party will \u201ckeep fighting for a developing Greece within Europe\u201d and \u201cagainst those who say they want to get Greece out of Europe.\u201d  His party narrowly came in first in the May 6 elections, but opinion polls since then have suggested that Syriza would finish in first place in a new election."

        "content": "Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb army commander who went on trial Wednesday for crimes against humanity, is a notorious name synonymous with the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the Balkan wars of the 1990s and the bloody assaults on Sarajevo and Srebrenica. During the five-day orgy of slaughter at Srebrenica, which Mladic is accused of being directly involved in, up to 8,000 Muslims were exterminated in what was described by the U.N. war crimes tribunal as \u201cthe triumph of evil.\u201d A judge at The Hague tribunal described what happened there in July 1995 as \u201ctruly scenes from hell written on the darkest pages of human history.\u201d Born in Kalnovik, Bosnia-Herzegovina, during the height of World War II, the 70-year-old was a career soldier who served in Yugoslavia\u2019s military before that nation dissolved in the early 1990s.  Mladic was shaped by the war when his father was killed by Croat Nazis when he was two years old. In 1965 he graduated from a military academy and joined the Communist Party in Yugoslavia, an ethnic stew of six states \u2013 Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia, Slovenia, Croatia, and Montenegro. Over the following three decades he rose rapidly through the ranks of the Yugoslav army. By the time he took Bosnia\u2019s battlefields he had become a hero to many Serbs, seen as defender of their dwindling fortunes.. In May 1992, Bosnia\u2019s Serbian political leaders picked him to head their forces and lead the assault on their enemies. Bosnia\u2019s Muslim leaders wanted independence while the Serbs wanted to remain part of Yugoslavia \u2013 and the ethnic majority. Mladic wasted no time galvanizing his heavily armed forces to besiege Sarajevo, cutting the city off from the outside world by shelling and sniping at its poorly prepared civilian population in the valley below them. More than 10,000 people, most of them civilians, were killed. Over the course of the three-year war that raged across the whole country more than a quarter million people died, making the conflict the bloodiest in Europe since World War II. A French policeman who collected evidence from Bosnian Muslims, Jean-Rene Ruez, told The Hague tribunal in 1996 that Bosnian Serb forces killed and tortured refugees in Srebrenica at will. Streets were littered with corpses, he said, and rivers were red with blood. Many people committed suicide to avoid having their noses, lips and ears chopped off, he said. Among other lurid accounts of mass murder, Ruez cited cases of adults being forced to kill their children or watching as soldiers ended the young lives. \u201cOne soldier approached a woman in the middle of a crowd,\u201d he said. \u201cHer child was crying. The soldier asked why the child was crying and she explained that he was hungry. The soldier made a comment like, \u2018He won\u2019t be hungry anymore.\u2019 He slit the child\u2019s throat in front of everybody.\u201d As the war ended in the fall of 1995, Mladic went on the run. Over the years, he eluded authorities while his cohort, Karadzic, was apprehended and is facing various charges at the court in The Hague. Their mentor, former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, died in jail in 2006 during his trial at The Hague. Eventually, more than 16 years later, he was captured an hour\u2019s drive from the Serbian capital living on a farm with a cousin. World leaders and human rights groups described the arrest as \u201chistoric\u201d and \u201can important step forward.\u201d Key dates in hunt for Mladic U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called it a \u201chistoric day for international justice. This arrest marks an important step in our collective fight against impunity.\u201d Interpol called Mladic \u201cEurope\u2019s most wanted war crimes suspect\u201d while Amnesty International\u2019s law chief Widney Brown said \u201cat last the people who suffered have hope he will be brought to justice.\u201d The arrest meant a major hurdle that once stood between Serbia and its long-awaited entrance into the European Union was overcome, but the trial could also usher in political backlash from the country\u2019s electorate, some of whom consider Mladic a hero. Speaking to a Serbian Radical Party demonstration outside Belgrade\u2019s parliament building immediate after the arrest, Darko Mladic described his father as \u201ca freedom fighter.\u201d The elder Mladic \u201cdefended his own nation, defended his people, which was his job,\u201d his son said. Robertson: Bosnia\u2019s future is tied to justice His family and lawyer have tried to use his poor health to prevent his extradition to the International Criminal Tribunal on the Former Yugoslavia in the Netherlands, but they failed. In the court room at The Hague last year Mladic appeared to have lost none of his visceral dislike of his enemies. CNN\u2019s Nic Robertson said he saw the defendant drawing his finger across his throat, \u201ca gesture aimed directly at at some of the Srebrenica widows sitting in front of me, whose husbands he is accused of killing.\u201d"

United\u2019s legendary Scottish manager Alex Ferguson was also honored, having like Giggs been part of all 12 title triumphs.   \u201cBeing named as the best player in the 20 seasons of the Premier League is a tremendous honor for me,\u201d Giggs, 38, told the league\u2019s official website, \u201cand very humbling when you consider some of the brilliant players who were nominated alongside me.\u201d There was also an award for the Old Trafford team\u2019s star striker Wayne Rooney, who received the \u201cGoal of 20 Seasons\u201d gong for his stunning overhead kick against archrivals Manchester City in February 2011. United\u2019s 4-3 defeat of neighbors City in September 2009, which included a winning goal from striker Michael Owen in stoppage time, was voted the finest Premier League match. But despite United\u2019s dominance, Arsenal\u2019s championship-winning side of the 2003-04 season took home the Best Team prize. Known as \u201cThe Invincibles,\u201d the London club is the only team to remain unbeaten throughout an entire Premier League campaign. The full list of award winners feature in the gallery above.

        "content": "Kenny Dalglish\u2019s name is synonymous with Liverpool, one of England\u2019s most successful football teams, but after a disappointing second spell in charge as manager he has been sacked by the club\u2019s American owners. Liverpool confirmed Wednesday Dalglish has been relieved of his duties by Fenway Sports Group, headed by John W. Henry, who also owns baseball\u2019s Boston Red Sox. Dalglish won the English League Cup in February but despite huge outlay on players before the start of this season, his side struggled in the Premier League, finishing in eighth place \u2013 their worst return for 18 years. A statement on the club\u2019s official website read: \u201cFenway Sports Group (FSG) and Liverpool Football Club announced that Kenny Dalglish is to leave his post today as manager after having his contract terminated. CNN blog: Why Liverpool must sack Kenny Dalglish \u201cAfter a careful and deliberative review of the season, the club came to the decision that a change was appropriate. It is not a decision that was reached lightly or hastily. \u201cThe search for a new manager will begin immediately.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s 2011-12 campaign was punctuated by controversy. Striker Luis Suarez was handed an eight-game ban by the English Football Association for racially abusing Manchester United\u2019s French defender Patrice Evra.  Dalglish and Liverpool\u2019s players wore t-shirts in support of the Uruguayan, who maintained his innocence, but the club were forced to apologize when the striker refused to shake Evra\u2019s hand before Liverpool\u2019s game at Old Trafford in February. The Scot\u2019s relationship with the media became increasingly fractious and he walked out of several post-match interviews towards the end of the season. Liverpool narrowly failed to secure a cup double earlier this month, losing 2-1 in the FA Cup final at Wembley by Chelsea, and then lost the final game of the season at Swansea. Despite his sacking, Dalglish said it had been an \u201chonor and a privilege\u201d to manage the club again. He said: \u201cOf course I am disappointed with results in the league, but I would not have swapped the Carling Cup win for anything as I know how much it meant to our fans and the club to be back winning trophies. FA Cup success primes Chelsea for Champions League final \u201cWhilst I am obviously disappointed to be leaving the football club, I can say that the matter has been handled by the owners and all concerned in an honorable, respectful and dignified way and reflects on the quality of the people involved and their continued desire to move the football club forward in the same way as when they arrived here. \u201cI would like to thank all of the staff at the club for their effort and loyalty. I said when first approached about coming back as manager that I would always be of help if I can at any time and that offer remains the same. \u201cFinally, I want to put on record my heartfelt gratitude to Liverpool\u2019s fans, who have always given me and the club their unwavering support. Without them neither the club nor I would have achieved anything.\u201d Dalglish first joined Liverpool as a player in 1977, winning six league titles and three European Cups. He became player manager in 1985 and led the club to a league and FA Cup double in his first season. Two more league championships followed before he resigned in 1991, two years after the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 Liverpool fans were killed at an FA Cup semifinal. He returned as an ambassador in 2009 and helped coach Liverpool\u2019s young players. He was appointed manager for the second time when the club removed Roy Hodgson, now the England manager, in January 2011. Dalglish oversaw an sharp upturn in fortunes as he led Liverpool away from the lower reaches of the Premier League, eventually finishing sixth, having spent big on striker Andy Carroll in January. Several more players arrived in expensive deals over the summer but have failed to make their mark at Anfield.  Winger Stewart Downing, signed for a reported $31 million, failed to score or provide an assist in 36 Premier League games \u2013 but has still been named in England\u2019s squad for Euro 2012. Liverpool\u2019s owner John Henry said: \u201cKenny will always be more than a championship-winning manager, more than a championship-winning star player.  \u201cHe is in many ways the heart and soul of the club. He personifies everything that is good about Liverpool Football Club. He has always put the club and its supporters first. Kenny will always be a part of the family at Anfield. \u201cOur job now is to identify and recruit the right person to take this club forward and build on the strong foundations put in place during the last 18 months.\u201d"

        "content": "Ratko Mladic, who is accused of orchestrating a horrific campaign of ethnic cleansing during the bloody civil war that ripped apart Yugoslavia, showed no remorse as his war crimes trial opened Wednesday, at one point even appearing to threaten victims in the court. The former general drew his hand across his neck as if cutting a throat while staring at victims of the war that introduced the phrase \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d  At other times, the man accused of being \u201cthe Butcher of Bosnia\u201d stared at them, fire in his eyes, and he once growled at the survivors. The 70-year-old former Bosnian Serb general has been indicted on 11 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in the 1992-95 war.  His trial is taking place at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague, Netherlands, a special court established to try those responsible for atrocities during the war.  Prosecutors say Mladic\u2019s campaign included the massacre of 8,000 Muslims in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica. On Wednesday, prosecutor Dermot Groome laid out details of the case against Mladic, saying that ethnic cleansing was not a byproduct of the war, but a specific aim of the Bosnian Serb leadership. He will set out to show that Mladic was directly responsible for atrocities carried out by his forces, who were fighting for control of land in ethnically mixed Bosnia. Sexual violence was a weapon of war, Groome said, describing a woman who said she had been raped more than 50 times, and women who were forced by Bosnian Serb forces to perform sex acts on members of their own families. Prosecutors will use survivor testimonies and video clips to make their case at a trial that is likely to last for months or years. Among those in the courtroom were the families of Srebrenica victims. \u201cVictims have waited nearly two decades to see Ratko Mladic in the dock,\u201d Param-Preet Singh, senior counsel in the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch, said ahead of the trial. \u201cHis trial should lay to rest the notion that those accused of atrocity crimes can run out the clock on justice.\u201d 2011: Ratko Mladic captured Mladic\u2019s trial begins after a landmark war crimes ruling last month, when another international tribunal found former Liberian President Charles Taylor guilty of aiding and abetting war crimes in neighboring Sierra Leone\u2019s notoriously brutal civil war. Taylor got a final chance to address his court Wednesday as Mladic\u2019s trial opened, and he said he was \u201csaddened\u201d by a verdict that he portrayed as unfair. \u201cBoth trials are evidence of the growing international trend to hold perpetrators of atrocities to account, no matter how senior their position,\u201d Human Rights Watch said. Mladic eluded authorities for nearly 16 years until his capture in May 2011, when police burst into the garden of a small house in northern Serbia.  Europe\u2019s highest-ranking war crimes suspect was discovered standing against a wall in a utility room normally used for storing farm equipment, according to a government minister. Though he was carrying two handguns, he surrendered without a fight. He was extradited for trial in the Netherlands. But from day one in custody, he has exhibited defiance and appears not to have relinquished his visceral antagonism toward his enemies. Before the trial that started Wednesday, he also drew a finger across his throat in court, a gesture aimed at some of the Srebrenica widows. At other times, he disrupted proceedings by putting on a hat in the courtroom and refusing to enter a plea. He has sought delays in his trial and said he is in failing health. In July 1995, Mladic was in command of the Bosnian Serb army and led his soldiers into the town of Srebrenica. In the days that followed, the soldiers systematically slaughtered nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys. Bosnia peace negotiator Richard Holbrooke once described Mladic as \u201cone of those lethal combinations that history thrusts up occasionally \u2013 a charismatic murderer.\u201d  In the three decades leading up to the violent splintering of Yugoslavia, Mladic rose rapidly through the ranks of the Yugoslav army. In 1991, he served as a front-line commander spearheading Serb forces in a yearlong war with Croatia. By the time he took to Bosnia\u2019s battlefields, he had become a hero to many Serbs, seen as a defender of their dwindling fortunes. In May 1992, Bosnia\u2019s Serbian political leaders picked him to lead the assault on their Muslim enemies who clamored for independence. Robertson: Bosnia\u2019s future is tied to justice Mladic wasted no time galvanizing his heavily armed forces in a siege of Sarajevo, cutting the city off from the outside world. Serb forces pounded the city every day from higher ground positions, trapping Sarajevo\u2019s ill-prepared residents in the valley below. More than 10,000 people, mostly civilians, perished. Some observers conjured images of Sarajevo in describing Syrian attacks on the besieged city of Homs earlier this year. As the war ended in the fall of 1995, Mladic went on the run.  Shortly after Mladic was sent to The Hague last year, authorities nabbed former Croatian Serb rebel leader Goran Hadzic. He was the last Yugoslav war crimes suspect at large. Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic was arrested in 2008. And Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was arrested in 2001 but died before his trial could be completed."

        "content": "From high above the earth, an astronaut launched the latest report card on the health of the planet which once again paints an alarming image of over-consumption and exploitation. In a recorded message, Andre Kuipers, an astronaut with the European Space Agency on his second mission to the International Space Station, said he had a unique view of the earth which he orbits 16 times a day. \u201cFrom space, you see the forest fires, you see the air pollution, you see erosion,\u201d he said, launching the World Wildlife Fund\u2019s Living Planet Report for 2012. The biennial survey shows the world is still consuming far more than the Earth can replenish, along with a widening and \u201cpotentially catastrophic\u201d gap between the ecological footprints of rich and poor nations. \u201cThe report is clear that we\u2019re still going downhill, that our ecological footprint, the pressure we put on the earth\u2019s resources, continues to rise so we\u2019re now using 50% more resources that the earth can replenish and biodiversity continues to decline,\u201d said Jim Leape, Director General of WWF International. The report includes a list of the world\u2019s top 10 polluting countries topped by Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East. They\u2019re followed by Denmark, Belgium and the United States. Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Ireland make up the remainder. Countries are ranked on their consumption of renewable resources versus their biocapacity, or ability to produce renewable resources and absorb CO2 emissions. Dominating the list are high-income countries, whose average ecological footprint is now five times that of low-income nations. And the gap is increasing. Between 1970 and 2008, the ecological footprint of high-income nations rose seven percent, the report said. Over that period, the same index for poor countries tumbled 60%. The disparity indicates richer nations are buying resources from poorer countries which have natural resources available to exploit, the report said.  \u201cWhat one of the things that we as a global community have been slow to realize is that even in an industrialized economy will still demand very directly on the health of natural systems to provide the water we drink and to keep the climate stable,\u201d Leape said. \u201cAs you see forest loss continue, as you see the depletion of rivers, you are undercutting the foundation for economic development in those countries,\u201d he said. Leape said there are signs some large business and governments are taking steps to reduce their burden on the environment. Denmark, for example, number four on the list of worst polluters, has pledged to double the nation\u2019s windpower and to wean itself off fossil fuels by 2050. \u201cWhat you see now is companies and governments who are on the vanguard beginning to make shifts but those shifts have to be driven down into entire markets and across all governments. We\u2019re not yet getting to the scale required to begin to bend the curves,\u201d Leape said. The impact of rich nations worldwide is clear in figures showing that the steepest drop in biodiversity over the past 40 years has occurred in poorer countries. The decline, the report said, demonstrates \u201chow the poorest and most vulnerable nations are subsidizing the lifestyles of wealthier nations.\u201d \u201cGrowing external resource dependencies are putting countries at significant risk,\u201d said Mathis Wackernagel, President of Global Footprint Network, which collaborated with the WWF and the Zoological Society of London on the report.  \u201cUsing ever more nature, while having less is a dangerous strategy, yet most countries continue to pursue this path,\u201d he said. The main feature of the Living Planet Report is the Living Planet Index which tracks the health of the world\u2019s ecosystems by monitoring 9,000 populations of more than 2,600 species. It shows a near 30% drop in biodiversity since 1970, and an even faster decline in the tropics of 60%. However, the index for temperate regions rose 31%, as some species showed signs of recovery after huge biodiversity losses the previous century. \u201cThe read down on the temperate zone masks much more precipitous declines in other parts of the world. You see a huge loss of biodiversity across the tropics and in the poorest countries and I think that\u2019s the most alarming fact in those indices,\u201d Leape said. The report was released just five weeks before the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro, otherwise known as Rio +20. \u201cWe need to see real leadership from the governments of the world coming together to commit themselves to step up to this challenge,\u201d Leape said. \u201cThey can take some decisions in Rio that really would make a difference in terms of setting a new course for the global economy.\u201d"

        "content": "While Fernando Alonso has overcome the shortcomings of his 2012 Ferrari to be an early title contender, the two-time world champion\u2019s teammate Felipe Massa is facing an uncertain future after a disappointing start to the Formula One season. Massa was again well off the pace at the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday, despite improvements to the vehicle which helped Alonso finish second and move level on points with championship leader Sebastian Vettel. The Brazilian suffered the embarrassment of being lapped by Alonso and Williams\u2019 race winner Pastor Maldonado, coming in 15th to leave him with just two points from the opening five rounds. Ferrari\u2019s team principal Stefano Domenicali publicly backed the under-performing 31-year-old in March, but Massa has now been told better results will be expected when the championship resumes in Monaco on May 27. \u201cFelipe was very unlucky, both in the race and in qualifying,\u201d read a statement on Ferrari\u2019s official website.  \u201cBut everyone, he more than anyone, is expecting a change of gear starting right away with the Monaco Grand Prix, his second home race, given that he lives just a few hundred meters from what, as from next Sunday, will be transformed into the paddock for the sixth round of the 2012 championship. \u201c Massa\u2019s most successful year in the elite division of motorsport was in 2008, when he was denied a first world championship crown by McLaren\u2019s Lewis Hamilton on the final corner of the final race. But the former Sauber driver has struggled to reach those heights since, partly due to a freak accident at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix which left him with a fractured skull. His form has also spiraled since being told to let Alonso pass him while leading a race in Germany in 2010.  The last time the first five races were won by five different drivers was in 1983, and Domenicali believes Ferrari can be true contenders despite a lack of early-season pace. \u201cIt takes very little to change the hierarchy among the teams and this rule is even more true when the differences are just a few tenths or even hundredths,\u201d he said.  \u201cThis year, the winner will be whoever manages to bring the best technical updates to the track in the shortest time possible: staying still for just a handful of races could mean finishing out of the points, given that so many teams have proved capable of fighting for the top places.  \u201cWe achieved our goal of making a step forward in Spain, but we must continue down this path, especially as the gap to the time that gave Hamilton his pole position is still too big.\u201d  Meanwhile, F1 chiefs are still investigating the fire that cast a shadow over Williams\u2019 first grand prix victory since 2004 and the first race victory by a Venezuelan driver. The blaze in the British team\u2019s garage left seven people in hospital, but a statement released by Williams on Monday confirmed that all but one of those injured have now been released. \u201cOne member of the team remains in hospital in Spain having suffered burns in the incident,\u201d read the statement. \u201cHe is stable and will return to the UK within the next 48 hours to receive further medical care.  \u201cHis family are in constant communication and he is in good spirits. Investigations into the cause of the fire are ongoing in collaboration with the FIA and local authorities.  \u201cThe team would like to thank everyone for their good wishes and support over the past 24 hours.\u201d Team principal Frank Williams thanked the other teams for their help and support following the incident. \u201cWhile the incident was unexpected and definitely most undesirable, it has demonstrated the genuine cohesiveness, camaraderie and spirit of co-operation that exists within the Formula One paddock,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe astonishing response from the teams and other paddock personnel was immediate, unconditional and overwhelming.\u201d "

        "content": "Defending champions Novak Djokovic and Maria Sharapova came through second round matches at the joint ATP/WTA tournament in Rome Tuesday with straight sets victories. Djokovic was in blistering form under the lights at the Foro Italico and saw off Australian teenager Bernard Tomic 6-3 6-3 in an entertaining encounter. The world number one was coming off a shock defeat to compatriot Janko Tipsarevic in Madrid last week on the notorious blue clay, but an upset never looked likely against Tomic. Djokovic quickly moved two breaks ahead in the opener before Tomic made a spirited recovery to achieve a break of his own. It only delayed the inevitable as Djokovic broke him again to close out the first set. A single break of service decided the second set with the Serbian always in command as he wrapped up victory in 68 minutes. Their match had followed a classic encounter between fourth seed Andy Murray and Argentina veteran David Nalbandian. Murray,  who missed Madrid through injury, breezed through opener 6-1 but Nalbandian hit back to level by taking the second set 6-4. When he broke Murray in the decider an upset looked on the cards, but the Scot rallied and pulled ahead at 6-5 courtesy of a fortunate net cord. Nalbandian forced two break points as Murray served for the match, but both were saved and the Murray, on his 25th birthday, clinched a hard-fought victory after two hours 38 minutes. Earlier, Sharapova, the second seed on the red clay in the Italian capital, had fought off a tenacious challenge from American Christina McHale. She won 7-5 7-5 but trailed in both sets, including coming from 4-1 down in the opener. She finally prevailed after two hours 12 minutes to keep the defense of her title on track. \u201cI made too many unforced errors in the first part of the match and she was playing extremely consistently,\u201d the Russian told the WTA Tour website.  \u201cMaybe I was trying to hit too many winners then. But I was fortunate enough to win that first set and get back into it in the second set.\u201d Improving on the surface, Sharapova has won 17 of her last 19 matches on the surface, taking the title at Stuttgart earlier this year. Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova also progressed to the third round, but like Sharapova, was pushed over two sets against Russia\u2019s Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova before winning 7-5 6-4. The pair had shared their previous four meetings, but fourth seed Kvitova showed she is adapting better to clay to go through after retrieving early deficits in both sets. The Williams sisters also progressed, with Madrid champion Serena next facing Russia\u2019s Nadia Petrova in the second round on Wednesday. The America, seeded ninth, won the tournament 10 years ago. Her older sibling Venus beat Romania\u2019s Simona Halep in the first round for the second tournament in a row, and the 1999 Rome champion will take on Russia\u2019s Ekaterina Makarova as she seeks to improve on her second-round defeat on the blue clay last week.

The 36-year-old American is stalled on 14 major titles \u2013 four short of the all-time record held by Jack Nicklaus \u2013 since his U.S. Open triumph in 2008. His career has been interrupted by injury and well publicized problems in his personal life, but this year Woods returned to top form with victory in the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill. But disappointing showings at Quail Hollow, where he missed the cut, and the U.S. Masters and Players Championship have taken the shine off that win as he heads into the big tournaments this summer. Woods announced on his official website that he will play in the Greenbrier Classic for the first time before heading for the British Open at Royal Lytham in July. His arch-rival Phil Mickelson will also tee it up on the Old White TPC course which saw Australian Stuart Appleby shoot a remarkable 59 in 2010 to win the tournament. Woods, who has won 72 times on the PGA Tour, has previously built his preparation for majors around a restricted schedule of select tournaments, but earlier this season he sprang another surprise by playing in the Honda Classic for the first time since his teenage years. \u201cI\u2019m excited about my schedule and looking forward to competing,\u201d said Woods, who will next head for the Memorial Tournament, hosted by Jack Nicklaus, which starts on May 31.

His preparation events for the British Open will be the AT&T National at Congressional before heading to the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia."

        "content": "The body of a mobster buried among cardinals and bishops on a Vatican property has been exhumed in an investigation into a teenage girl\u2019s disappearance. Investigators at the church of Sant\u2019Apollinare in central Rome opened the tomb of Enrico \u201cRenatino\u201d De Pedis on Monday in the search for clues about what happened to Emanuela Orlandi, the daughter of a prominent Vatican employee. The 15-year-old vanished without a trace after leaving her Vatican apartment for music lessons on the afternoon of June 22, 1983. The mystery has captivated people throughout Italy and triggered numerous conspiracy theories. In the crypt, in addition to De Pedis\u2019 body, investigators found dozens of boxes of human bones, which they are testing. At the time of Emanuela\u2019s disappearance nearly 30 years ago, a witness reported seeing a girl who fit her description getting into a dark green BMW near the music school, which was adjacent to the Sant\u2019Apollinare church. That lead was never corroborated.    In 1981, two years before the girl\u2019s disappearance, Turkish national Mehmet Ali Agca shot Pope John Paul II.   In the days after Emanuela disappeared, her parents received anonymous phone calls from someone promising the safe return of their daughter if the Vatican released Agca. Meanwhile, an anonymous caller told police that Emanuela was kidnapped to keep her father, Ercole Orlandi, quiet.  That caller said Ercole Orlandi had stumbled upon sensitive documents that tied banker Roberto Calvi to an organized crime syndicate.  Calvi was known as \u201cGod\u2019s banker\u201d for his close association with both the Holy See and its primary banking facility, Banco Ambrosiano. Orlandi worked in the Vatican\u2019s special events office that organizes papal functions and Catholic celebrations.    Calvi was found hanged in London in 1982.  Speculation turned from suicide to homicide in that case.  The tipster to police in Italy said Orlandi\u2019s daughter was nabbed to ensure her father\u2019s silence. Ercole Orlandi died in 2004. In 2005, another anonymous call to an Italian detective said Emanuela was kidnapped on the orders of the then-vicar of Rome, Cardinal Ugo Poletti, and that \u201cthe secret to the mystery lies in a tomb in Sant\u2019Apollinare basilica\u201d \u2013 specifically De Pedis\u2019 tomb. De Pedis was gunned down in Rome in 1990 and his body was moved to the basilica some time before 1997, presumably either as part of a secret deal for a massive loan De Pedis made to the Vatican or to protect his tomb from being desecrated by rival gang members. In 2008, De Pedis\u2019 mistress said he was involved in Emanuela\u2019s kidnapping and that the girl was buried under the foundation of a house outside of Rome.  Investigators searched that house but found that the concrete foundation was poured the year before the girl\u2019s disappearance and could not have been connected to the crime. The Vatican has distanced itself from the Orlandi controversy.  In a three-page letter broadcast on RAI television, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said he asked Vatican cardinals whether the Vatican\u2019s failure to collaborate in the original kidnapping probe was \u201cnormal and justifiable affirmation of Vatican sovereignty, or if in fact circumstances were withheld that might have helped clear something up.\u201d  The Vatican cooperated immediately with the exhumation. After opening the tomb Monday, investigators found De Pedis\u2019 body so well preserved that scientific police were able to confirm his identity through fingerprints.  Also inside the crypt were the boxes of bones, according to investigators on the scene. The church has been used for burials for two centuries.  Still, all of the bones will be tested to determine whether they are tied to De Pedis or to Emanuela\u2019s disappearance. De Pedis will not be reburied in the church, the Vatican said. De Pedis family lawyer Lorenzo Radogna said the remains will either be cremated or reinterred in a public cemetery in Rome."

        "content": "A Jewish group in Greece has condemned the leader of the extreme-right Golden Dawn party over comments he made about the Holocaust in a TV interview. Nikos Michaloliakos told Greece\u2019s Mega TV channel in an interview shown Sunday that \u201cthere were no gas chambers and ovens [crematoria] in Auschwitz,\u201d said the Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece, or KIS. The politician\u2019s remarks come amid growing concern about the apparent rise of the far right in Greece. Golden Dawn won 21 seats in the country\u2019s May 6 parliamentary elections, after winning almost 7% of the vote. Two years ago, it commanded only 0.28% support. Some members of the ultranationalist party, which proposes harsh measures to combat illegal immigration, have been linked with street violence and neo-Nazism.  In a statement, KIS urged the Greek government to \u201ccondemn and isolate the forces seeking the revival of the darkest ideology of the European history,\u201d saying Michaloliakos\u2019 position was an affront to the Greek people. \u201cIt is an insult to the historical memory, the memory of the 6 million Jews, our brethren, amongst whom there where 70,000 Greek Jews, who perished in the death camps of Auschwitz, Dachau, Treblinka and the other sites of the extermination factory founded by Adolf Hitler,\u201d KIS said in a statement. \u201cIt is an insult toward the survivors, who are still alive to bear witness of this atrocity. It is an insult toward all those who fought against the Nazis. It is an insult to the history of Greece, the sacrifices of the Greek people and the struggle to defend the principles of freedom, democracy and humanism.\u201d Greek government spokesman Pantelis Kapsis condemned Michaloliakos\u2019 remarks in a statement Monday as \u201ca distortion of history and a fierce insult to the memory of the millions of Holocaust victims.\u201d Greece has been in a state of political turmoil since the elections, which saw voters fleeing the moderate parties blamed for backing harsh austerity measures for parties to the far left and far right of the political spectrum.  The country faces fresh elections after repeated attempts to form a coalition government ended in failure Tuesday. The political instability has raised the possibility that Greece will fail to make debt payments as early as next month, potentially forcing the country out of the euro, the currency used by 17 European Union countries. Matthew Feldman, director of the Radicalism and New Media Research Group at the University of Northampton, in Britain, says far-right groups are seeing a resurgence in parts of Europe. Instead of open racial attacks, they play up a threat to national identity and criticize multiculturalism, particularly as it relates to Islam, he said. However, while Golden Dawn gained strength in the May 6 election, another far-right party, LAOS, lost its small presence in Greece\u2019s 300-seat parliament as voters punished it for its support of Greece\u2019s austerity program."

        "content": "From the day of his capture, Ratko Mladic has been as combative in custody as he was as a battlefield commander during the bloody civil war that ripped apart Yugoslavia two decades ago and saw the worst slaughter in Europe since Nazi rule. Mladic, 70, is accused of orchestrating a horrific campaign of ethnic cleansing that included the massacre of 8,000 Muslims in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica. The former Bosnian Serb general has been indicted on 11 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in the 1992-95 war that killed 200,000 people and displaced another 2.2 million people from their homes. On Monday, his lawyers filed a petition to delay his trial by six months, contending the prosecution failed to share evidence in a timely manner and that the presiding Dutch judge was biased because of his role in other trials of Serbs. The court, however, said the trial is set to open as scheduled on Wednesday morning. Mladic will face his accusers at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague, Netherlands. Among those in the courtroom will be the families of Srebrenica victims. \u201cVictims have waited nearly two decades to see Ratko Mladic in the dock,\u201d said Param-Preet Singh, senior counsel in the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch. \u201cHis trial should lay to rest the notion that those accused of atrocity crimes can run out the clock on justice.\u201d 2001: Ratko Mladic captured Mladic\u2019s trial begins after a landmark war crimes ruling last month, when another international tribunal found former Liberian President Charles Taylor guilty of aiding and abetting war crimes in neighboring Sierra Leone\u2019s notoriously brutal civil war. \u201cBoth trials are evidence of the growing international trend to hold perpetrators of atrocities to account, no matter how senior their position,\u201d Human Rights Watch said. Mladic eluded authorities for nearly 16 years until his capture last May, when police burst into the garden of a small house in northern Serbia. Europe\u2019s highest-ranking war crimes suspect was discovered standing against a wall in a utility room normally used for storing farm equipment, according to a government minister. Though he was carrying two handguns, he surrendered without a fight. He was extradited for trial in the Netherlands. But from day one in custody, he has exhibited defiance and appears not to have relinquished his visceral antagonism toward his enemies. He drew a finger across his throat in court, a gesture aimed at some of the Srebrenica widows. At other times, he disrupted proceedings by putting on a hat in the courtroom and refusing to enter a plea. He has sought delays in his trial and said he is in failing health. But come Wednesday, Mladic\u2019s long-awaited trial is set to start. In July 1995, Mladic was in command of the Bosnian Serb Army and led his soldiers into the town of Srebrenica. In the days that followed, the soldiers systematically slaughtered nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys. Mladic was dubbed the \u201cButcher of Bosnia.\u201d Bosnia peace negotiator Richard Holbrooke once described Mladic as \u201cone of those lethal combinations that history thrusts up occasionally \u2013 a charismatic murderer.\u201d  In the three decades leading up to the violent splintering of Yugoslavia, Mladic rose rapidly through the ranks of the Yugoslav army. In 1991, he served as a front-line commander spearheading Serb forces in a yearlong war with Croatia. By the time he took to Bosnia\u2019s battlefields, he had become a hero to many Serbs, seen as a defender of their dwindling fortunes. In May 1992, Bosnia\u2019s Serbian political leaders picked him to lead the assault on their Muslim enemies who clamored for independence.  Mladic wasted no time galvanizing his heavily armed forces in a siege of Sarajevo, cutting the city off from the outside world. Serb forces pounded the city every day from higher ground positions, trapping Sarajevo\u2019s ill-prepared citizens in the valley below. More than 10,000 people, mostly civilians, perished. Some observers conjured images of Sarajevo in describing Syrian attacks on the besieged city of Homs earlier this year. As the war ended in the fall of 1995, Mladic went on the run.  Shortly after Mladic was sent to The Hague last year, authorities nabbed former Croatian Serb rebel leader Goran Hadzic. He was the last Yugoslav war crimes suspect at large. Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic was arrested in 2008. And Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was arrested in 2001 but died before his trial could be completed."

        "content": "France\u2019s freshly inaugurated Socialist president plunged Tuesday into the economic mess that has perplexed policymakers and threatened governments by calling for policies that would spur growth in the ailing eurozone. \u201cI said that my wish is that growth is not an empty phrase, that it is something which, in reality, is happening,\u201d Francois Hollande told reporters in a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin. \u201cBecause, without growth, we can\u2019t do whatever we want, we won\u2019t reach the goals which we want to \u2013 and to reduce the debt and deficit.\u201d He said the best solution would be to \u201cput everything on the table\u201d on May 23, when the region\u2019s leaders plan to meet next. Hollande said he hopes Greece \u2013 whose economy is teetering and whose populace is fed up with the  austerity demands imposed by the country\u2019s international lenders \u2013 will remain in the eurozone, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to make it possible for Greece to find solutions.\u201d But he said it is up to the Greeks themselves to make their own decisions about what is best for the country. \u201cWhatever happens, I will respect the decision of Greece,\u201d he said. For her part, Merkel acknowledged after their hour-long meeting that \u201cthere is going to be, maybe, differences, but also lots of togetherness.\u201d She noted that Hollande\u2019s plane was struck by lightning as it flew from Paris. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s a good omen, a sign for our cooperation,\u201d said Merkel, who has championed austerity measures. France\u2019s first Socialist president since Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand left office in 1995 won in an election this month against incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy. Opinion: What Hollande\u2019s victory means for Europe\u2019s economy Hollande named Jean-Marc Ayrault, a senior party member and mayor of Nantes, as prime minister and asked him to form the new government, his office said. At an investiture ceremony at the Elysee Palace in Paris, Hollande said he wants to balance the need to reduce the debts of European governments with efforts to stimulate growth. He said he wants to discourage \u201cexorbitant\u201d incomes. \u201cIt\u2019s time to put production ahead of speculation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe challenge of this five-year term is recovery,\u201d he said at the Hotel de Ville in Paris, prior to departing for Berlin. \u201cWe have big plans. France will rise again and build on the strength and the energy of its creators, of its engineers, its researchers, those who make it live.\u201d Hollande has unsettled investors with his criticism of the austerity policies central to European bailout deals for troubled economies like those of Greece and Ireland. Greeted by flag-waving crowds on the street, a steady stream of prominent French figures arrived at the Elysee ahead of Tuesday\u2019s inauguration ceremony and walked on a red carpet through the palace\u2019s sun-filled courtyard. They included the Socialist Party leader Martine Aubry and Bertand Delanoe, the mayor of Paris. Inside the palace, they gathered under chandeliers to witness the transfer of power. The president-elect\u2019s car traveled along the tree-lined streets and avenues of Paris, carrying him over the River Seine and past the Grand Palais before pulling up inside the courtyard. Hollande made his way up the carpet to be met by Sarkozy. The two men, who had fought an at-times bitter campaign, shook hands before entering the palace for a private meeting. Afterward, Sarkozy and his wife, Carla Bruni, left the palace, waving from a car as they were driven off, and Hollande was sworn in as the seventh president of France\u2019s Fifth Republic. Ayrault, his newly appointed prime minister, has served as president of the Socialists in the National Assembly since 1997. In the same year, Ayrault was given a six-month suspended sentence and fined 30,000 francs for political favoritism. Born in 1950 to working-class parents, he worked as a German teacher before entering politics. He has served as mayor of Nantes since 1989 and had been widely expected to be Hollande\u2019s pick for prime minister. Hollande\u2019s election coincided with the vote in Greece that spawned the current political chaos in Athens and moved Greece closer to the possibility of abandoning the euro, the currency used by it and 16 other European Union countries. Hollande\u2019s professed doubts about the fiscal austerity advocated by Merkel, whose party suffered defeat in a vote Sunday in Germany\u2019s largest state, have raised questions about whether Paris and Berlin will read from the same script. Hollande has wasted no time addressing the matter. Upcoming events include a Group of Eight meeting and NATO summit this month, followed by a G-20 gathering and a European Council meeting in June. His approach is expected to affect policy in Afghanistan as well as Turkey and the Middle East. With Sarkozy, the United States enjoyed support for its positions on Syria, Iran and Afghanistan. Sarkozy also was a proponent of the NATO air campaign in Libya. Hollande, meanwhile, has yet to stake out all of his foreign policy positions. During the election campaign, he pledged to withdraw all French combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of the year. He can expect NATO leaders to urge him to soften his position when he attends the summit in Chicago this month, the focus of which will be Afghanistan. Relations between Turkey and France have been tense because of Sarkozy\u2019s apparent opposition to Turkey becoming a member of the European Union. Legislation passed during his presidency that made the denial of the Armenian genocide a crime also raised hackles in Ankara. Some observers expect Hollande to show more flexibility on Turkey. Domestically, Hollande has to prove to the French public that he is capable of acting on his promise to bring people together after Sarkozy\u2019s presidency, which often polarized opinion. Voting in the first round of the presidential election showed large numbers of voters turning to parties on the far left and right of the political spectrum.  That scenario could be repeated in legislative elections to be held next month, where Hollande\u2019s Socialist Party can secure a majority in parliament that would allow him to push through his agenda."

        "content": " A man set himself on fire Tuesday outside the court in Norway\u2019s capital, Oslo, where Anders Behring Breivik is on trial over terrorist attacks last summer that killed 77 people. \u201cWe don\u2019t know much about his motives, but he set himself alight outside the courthouse. Police were quick to put the fire out, and he has now been taken to hospital,\u201d Unni Groendal, head of media for Oslo police, told CNN. Police said in a statement released later Tuesday that the man was a Norwegian citizen from a foreign background. He has severe injuries, but they are not life-threatening, the statement said. He is expected to have surgery early Wednesday. \u201cIt is still unclear what the motive was for his action. He can currently not be questioned by police,\u201d the statement reads. A police spokesman earlier dismissed reports that the man had tried to force his way through the cordon outside the district courthouse. Norwegian daily newspaper VG reported that several court employees ran out with water bottles to pour water over the man. Video posted on the VG website shows the man running toward the court building with his hat and jacket on fire. Police officers then pull off his clothing and try to extinguish the flames as he lies on the ground. He was given first aid treatment on site. The incident happened about 1:45 p.m. local time (7:45 a.m. ET), according to Norwegian TV channel TV2.  Breivik is on trial on charges of voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror in the July 22 attacks. He admits carrying out an attack on a youth camp on Utoya Island and a bombing in Oslo that killed eight people. He boasts of being an ultranationalist who killed his victims to fight multiculturalism in Norway. Experts\u2019 assessment of Breivik\u2019s sanity will be a factor in determining what punishment he receives if convicted. Sentencing options could include imprisonment or confining him to a mental facility. Friday\u2019s court session was disrupted when the brother of one of those killed threw a shoe toward Breivik, hitting one of his defense lawyers. This week, the court is hearing testimony from some of those injured during Breivik\u2019s gun rampage on Utoya Island."

        "content": "Former News International chief Rebekah Brooks blasted British prosecutors Tuesday for charging her with obstructing the investigation into phone hacking at media mogul Rupert Murdoch\u2019s British newspapers, calling the case \u201can expensive sideshow.\u201d Brooks, whose husband, driver and personal assistant also face charges, said she is \u201cbaffled\u201d and angered by the decision to charge \u201cthose closest to me.\u201d \u201cOne day the details of this case will emerge, and people will see today as nothing more than an expensive sideshow \u2013 a waste of public money as a result of an unjust and weak decision,\u201d she told reporters outside her lawyer\u2019s office.  Her husband, Charles, said his wife is the victim of a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d and that the charges against him and others are \u201can attempt to use me and others as scapegoats, the effect of which is to ratchet up the pressure on my wife.\u201d \u201cI am confident that the lack of evidence against me will be borne out in court,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I have grave doubts that my wife will ever get a fair trial, given the volume of biased commentary which she has been subject to.\u201d Brooks, her husband and a total of four employees are accused of plotting to remove seven boxes of documents from News International offices and hide computers and documents from police. They are charged in connection with British police investigations into phone hacking and police bribery, which have been going on for more than a year. In addition to her driver and assistant, the charges include one of her security guards and the head of security for News International, the News Corp. subsidiary that publishes Murdoch\u2019s British newspapers. Brooks faces three counts of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, while the other four suspects face two counts each of the same charge. The maximum sentence for the charges they face is life in prison, the Crown Prosecution Service said, but a British lawyer said a more likely sentence is four to 18 months. Lawyer James Lofthouse said the longest sentence he could recall was 42 months. Separately, police announced they had arrested two more people Tuesday in connection with the bribery investigation. The man and woman were arrested at their home in London, police said. The arrests were based on information provided by News Corp., police said. Brooks became chief executive of News International after editing two Murdoch tabloids, the News of the World and the Sun. She resigned last summer and was arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice in March.  Alison Levitt of the Crown Prosecution Service said Tuesday that prosecutors felt there was \u201ca realistic prospect of conviction\u201d of the six suspects. Police gave prosecutors files on seven suspects in March. Levitt said prosecutors had decided not to press charges against one of them. Police opened investigations into phone hacking, computer hacking and bribery of public officials last year and have arrested dozens of people.  Following Tuesday\u2019s announcement, 40 others are waiting for police to decide whether to recommend that prosecutors press charges for phone hacking or corruption.  In addition to the man told by prosecutors Tuesday that they would not press charges against him, three other people have been arrested and released, with police saying they will take no further action. Also on Tuesday, the director of communications for former Prime Minister Tony Blair told CNNI\u2019s Christiane Amanpour that Britain\u2019s political elite had developed a too-cozy relationship with the press, and that he hoped \u201csome form of proper regulation\u201d would arise from the hacking and bribery scandal. \u201cI\u2019ve been arguing for some years (that the relationship) got itself into a very, very bad place and I hope it can lead to change,\u201d Alastair Campbell said in an interview aired on \u201cAmanpour.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just about Rupert Murdoch,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of newspapers in a geographically fairly small country. \u2026 And I think any political leader has to take account of the role they play in the political debate.\u201d In her testimony before the inquiry, Brooks detailed her many messages and meetings, even her yachting, with current Prime Minister David Cameron.   Said Campbell, \u201cI think David Cameron is on the record as saying that he got too close and he says that all politicians at times got too close.\u201d Amanpour also noted that Campbell\u2019s ex-boss last year became godfather to one of Murdoch\u2019s young daughters. \u201cThat happened after Tony Blair ceased being prime minister,\u201d Campbell said, but he added: \u201cI accept that it shows a closeness.\u201d He said Blair and the Labour Party sought and received endorsements from Murdoch\u2019s papers for the three elections they won. \u201cThe truth is, when we were in opposition, we\u2019d been out of power for a long time, the Labour Party that I worked for had really bad relations with the Murdoch press,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cAnd when Tony took over, we did decide we were going to try a different approach.\u201d He said he believed the Murdoch press \u201cbacked us because they knew we were going to win.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t win because they backed us, but it doesn\u2019t harm you.\u201d"

        "content": "As Manchester City\u2019s delirious fans spilled onto the pitch to revel in their team\u2019s remarkable English title win on Sunday, the celebrations also kicked off thousands of miles away in Abu Dhabi. In one cafe in the United Arab Emirates capital, some fans stood and danced, one even leaped onto a table, while others simply smiled contentedly as they puffed on their shisha pipes. City\u2019s dramatic 3-2 win over Queens Park Rangers was beamed to an estimated global audience of 4.7 billion in a powerful advert for just why Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan splashed out $320 million to buy the English Premier League club in 2008. The title was won at the Etihad Stadium. The players wore shirts emblazoned with the Etihad Airways logo \u2013 the Abu Dhabi-based airline. The title-clinching goal was scored by record $62 million signing Sergio Aguero in the dying seconds of the game. It was, in short, the brightest indicator yet of the Middle East\u2019s growing influence within European football. \u201cFor a lot of the people here, they say that they didn\u2019t even follow the Premier League until Manchester City was bought by the Abu Dhabi group,\u201d reported CNN\u2019s Leone Lakhani in Abu Dhabi, \u201cso you can imagine they\u2019ve been extremely happy with the results the entire year. \u201cIt elevates the country\u2019s emergence as a major sporting power.\u201d Owner Sheikh Mansour, a member of the country\u2019s ruling family, wasn\u2019t at the stadium on Sunday \u2013 he has been to only one match at the Etihad \u2013 and hasn\u2019t yet commented on the club\u2019s first title win in 44 years. But it was Sheikh Mansour who invested more than $600 million on players like Aguero, Yaya Toure and Carlos Tevez, and helped the perennial underachievers beat neighbors Manchester United to the title on goal difference. The incredible images on Sunday delivered the message on his behalf. Etihad Airways, which carried a message of congratulations to City on its website on Monday, reportedly paid more than $600 million for stadium naming rights and shirt sponsorship over 10 years, but the benefits are huge. \u201cWhen you win national and international titles, the exposure to a very, very relevant target audience for us couldn\u2019t be better,\u201d Peter Baumgartner, chief commercial officer of the airline, told CNN. While so many European countries are in financial difficulties, it isn\u2019t just Abu Dhabi taking advantage of football\u2019s global appeal. Dubai airline Emirates has a high-profile stadium and shirt sponsorship deal with Arsenal, and the Dubai-based Royal Emirates Group took over La Liga club Getafe last year. Getafe managed an 11th-place finish in Spain, seven places behind the league\u2019s other Middle Eastern-owned club, Malaga. Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nassar Al-Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family, bought out Malaga in 2010 when the modest club had never finished higher than seventh in the top flight. Veteran Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy helped the club to a fourth-place finish this season and a place in the Champions League qualifiers. Emboldened by the country\u2019s shock winning bid to host the 2022 World Cup, Qatar has since worked on spreading its influence across Europe. Qatar Sports Investment (QSI) reportedly paid $220 million over five years to put the Qatar Foundation name on Barcelona\u2019s shirt , but it is in France where the tiny natural gas-rich nation is really making its presence felt. QSI took over Paris Saint-Germain last summer, hoping not just to awake a sleeping giant of the French game but to create a new European powerhouse. \u201cThis is our strategy to bring PSG on long term to be one of the biggest in the world,\u201d club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi told CNN in March. To that end, PSG brought Brazilian Leonardo on board as sporting director, paid a French record $56 million to sign Javier Pastore and hired Carlo Ancelotti as coach. PSG might miss out on the league title \u2013 trailing Montpellier by three points with one game remaining \u2013 but the potentially exciting end to the season at least justifies al-Jazeera\u2019s investment in the Ligue Un domestic television rights at a reported \u20ac510 million a year until 2016. Al-Jazeera also has the international rights to the league, as well as most of the UEFA Champions League rights in France from 2012, and there are even suggestions that the broadcaster could make a bid for the UK rights for the English Premier League. It is all designed to establish Qatar as a global sporting power, which the country hopes will be confirmed in 2022 when it hosts the biggest single-event sporting competition in the world. The growing appeal of Qatar\u2019s domestic league has also been highlighted in recent times, with former Spain and Real Madrid striker Raul swapping German Bundesliga side Schalke for  Al-Sadd in the Qatar Stars League. For now, though, it is Abu Dhabi in the spotlight as it joins the blue half of the city of Manchester in joyous celebration."

        "content": "Greece will hold new elections in response to a political stalemate that left the debt-racked country unable to form a government, the office of President Karolos Papoulias said Tuesday. The announcement comes as the Greek debt crisis threatens the stability of the European Union\u2019s single currency. Papoulias has called for all parties to meet with him Wednesday to set up a caretaker government that will conduct the new vote, his office said. Greece has been in a political deadlock since elections nine days ago left no party with a majority. The leaders of three different parties have tried to cobble together a workable coalition, but all have failed. That leaves Greece facing another vote, probably in mid-June. Meanwhile, the rest of Europe has watched with a nervous eye, fearing Greece could fail to make debt payments as early as next month. And that could force the country out of the euro, the currency used by 17 European Union countries. Markets across Europe fell slightly on the news of political talks breaking up Tuesday. The Dow was flat in New York in morning trading. The collapse of Greek talks came as France\u2019s new president, Francois Hollande, met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel hours after his inauguration, and as European finance ministers met in Brussels, Belgium. What if Greece exits the eurozone? The European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund have been pumping money into Greece to keep the country in the euro, but they have demanded that the Greek government slash spending to get the funds. When angry voters went to the polls on May 6, they punished politicians who imposed the austerity measures, greatly reducing the number of seats held by the center-right New Democracy party and the Socialist PASOK party. Radical leftist leader Alexis Tsipras, whose Syriza party reaped the benefits of voter frustration with austerity, urged Greeks on Tuesday to continue resisting \u201cthe parties of the bailout.\u201d \u201cThey asked us to leave the country without any hope,\u201d he said, arguing that the May 6 election had left the terms of the bailout \u201cnull and void.\u201d New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras, meanwhile, said his party would \u201ckeep fighting for a developing Greece within Europe\u201d and \u201cagainst those who say they want to get Greece out of Europe.\u201d  His party narrowly came in first in the May 6 elections, but opinion polls since then have suggested that Syriza would finish in first place in a new election. Analysts have warned that Greece must not remain without a government for long. \u201cIf no government is in place before June when the next installment (of loan money) from the European Union and International Monetary Fund is due, we estimate that Greece will run out of money sometime between the end of June and beginning of July, at which point a return to the drachma would seem inevitable,\u201d Bank of America/Merrill Lynch wrote in a report released Friday."

        "content": "Sunday saw the curtain fall on Europe\u2019s biggest domestic football leagues, with scenes of triumph and despair across the continent as teams battled for glory or survival. After a weekend which saw records broken and nerves shredded, CNN rounds up the final sets of fixtures in Spain, England, Italy and Germany and details the winners and the losers. For many of Europe\u2019s leading players, the focus will now switch from club to country at Euro 2012 in Ukraine and Poland next month. Spain Real Madrid had already secured a 32nd Spanish title ahead of Sunday\u2019s final round of fixtures, but Jose Mourinho\u2019s team thrashed Real Mallorca 4-1 to finish the season on 100 points, a La Liga record.  The victory meant Real finished nine points ahead of archrivals Barcelona in second, who said farewell to departing coach Pep Guardiola with a 2-2 draw at Real Betis Saturday. Valencia finished third in the table for the third season in a row, while big-spending Malaga, owned by Qatari Abdullah bin Nasser bin Abdullah Al Ahmed Al Thani, clinched the fourth and final European Champions League qualifying spot. Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy announced his retirement following Malaga\u2019s 1-0 over Sporting Gijon, after a career which has seen the prolific former Netherlands striker star at Manchester United and Real Madrid. There was a shock at the bottom of the table, as 2006 Champions League semifinalists Villarreal slipped out of the top division for the first time in 12 years after losing 1-0 to Europa League winners Atletico Madrid. Villarreal, who finished fourth last season, will be joined in the second tier by Sporting Gijon and Racing Santander, who placed 19th and 20th respectively. Top goalscorer: Lionel Messi, Barcelona - 50 England Manchester City scored two goals in stoppage time to beat Queens Park Rangers 3-2 and pip neighbors Manchester United to the English Premier League title on goal difference. United looked to have done enough to clinch a 20th title after Wayne Rooney\u2019s header gave them a 1-0 win at Sunderland.  Did City win the title - or did United lose it? But in a dramatic finale Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero scored in the 92nd and 94th minutes to hand Roberto Mancini\u2019s City a first championship in 44 years. QPR were battling against relegation, but their top-flight status was secured after Bolton Wanderers could only draw 2-2 with Stoke City. Bolton needed to win to remain in the division, but the draw meant they were demoted alongside Blackburn Rovers and Wolverhampton Wanderers. Behind City and United, Arsenal beat West Bromwich Albion 3-2 to secure the third and final automatic qualification berth for next season\u2019s Champions League. Tottenham Hotspur finished fourth and Harry Redknapp\u2019s team will play in Europe\u2019s elite club competition next season if Chelsea, who placed sixth, lose to Bayern Munich in Saturday\u2019s Champions League final. Top goalscorer: Robin van Persie, Arsenal - 30 Italy Champions Juventus finished with a 3-1 victory over Atalanta, a win which meant the Turin club were undefeated throughout the entire 38-game Serie A season. The match was marked by a goal from the club\u2019s all-time leading goalscorer Alessandro del Piero, the 37-year-old striker who is leaving Juventus at the end of the season after 19 years with the Bianconeri. Filippo Inzaghi was another Italian legend to sign off with a goal, as the 38-year-old found the net on his final appearance for second-placed  AC Milan in a 2-1 win against relegated Novara. Udinese\u2019s fourth straight victory, a 2-0 triumph at Catania, was enough for them to finish third and claim the last Champions League spot. Lecce needed a win to have any hope of staying in the top flight, but a 1-0 loss to Chievo condemned them to Serie B football next season, alongside 19th-placed Novara and bottom club Cesena. Top goalscorer: Zlatan Ibrahimovic, AC Milan - 28 Germany Borussia Dortmund went into the final weekend of German domestic action having already sealed a second consecutive Bundesliga crown, and completed the double Saturday by winning the German Cup with a 5-2 victory over arch-rivals Bayern Munich. Jurgen Klopp\u2019s team finished eight points ahead of Bayern, who will face Chelsea at their own Allianz Arena home in the Champions League final. Schalke will join Dortmund and Bayern in next season\u2019s Champions League after cementing third place, while Borussia Monchengladbach will enter the qualifying rounds of the competition after finishing fourth. Four-time German champions Kaiserlautern endured a miserable campaign, finishing bottom. Cologne will join them in Bundesliga 2 next season after finishing 17th. Hertha Berlin were the third and final team to be relegated. The club from the German capital were beaten 4-3 on aggregate by Fortuna Dusseldorf, who finished third in Bundesliga 2, in a two-legged playoff. It means Fortuna will return to the top division next season for the first time in 15 years. Top goalscorer: Klaas Jan Huntelaar, Schalke - 29"

        "content": "Ana Ivanovic won a battle of former French Open champions as she dispatched Russia\u2019s Svetlana Kuznetsova in straight sets at the WTA tournament in Rome Monday. Ivanovic claimed her only grand slam win at Roland Garros in 2008 and boosted her preparation for another tilt at the title in Paris later this month with a 6-4 6-3 victory. Windy conditions at the Foro Italico hindered both players during a 73-minute match, but it was Serbia\u2019s Ivanovic who adapted the better. \u201cIt was hard to play, especially on the service because of the strong gusts of wind,\u201d she told the official tournament website. \u201cI\u2019m achieving a good level thanks to the work I\u2019m doing with my coach,\u201d she added. Ivanovic took all five of her break point opportunities against Kuznetsova, who succeeded her as French Open champion in 2009. Two breaks of service in the opener gave Ivanovic the advantage and she broke through three more times in a second set, including to love in the final game as she wrapped up victory. She faces either Alberta Brianti of Italy or Spaniard Silvia Soler in the second round and a potential last 16 clash against Russian star Maria Sharapova awaits the 13th seed. The joint ATP/WTA tournament has attracted a stellar field, with the men\u2019s event boasting the top four in the world, led by defending champion Novak Djokovic. He beat the \u2018king of clay\u2019 Rafael Nadal in the 2011 final, but both exited early at last week\u2019s Madrid Masters on the controversial blue surface. Roger Federer took advantage to leapfrog Nadal for second spot in the rankings with his 20th Masters Series title. But Nadal told the official tournament website that this did not concern him. \u201cTo be number two or three isn\u2019t going to change my game.   \u201cI am here in Rome and it is one of my favorite tournaments. I am motivated to play my best,\u201d he added. Women\u2019s world number one Victoria Azarenka will also be in action later in the week, coming off her final defeat in Madrid to a rejuvenated Serena Williams, who is also in the draw in Italy\u2019s premier tennis tournament.

Merkel\u2019s conservative Christian Democratic Union had claimed about 26% of the vote in the state of Northrhein-Westphalia, which includes the cities of Cologne, Bonn and Dusseldorf, according to returns aired by the German broadcasters ZDF and ARD. The center-left Social Democrats were leading with 39%, while their expected coalition partners the Greens were running at 11%. The results are likely to be seen as a blow to Merkel\u2019s leadership, although the vote won\u2019t affect the balance of power in Germany\u2019s federal parliament.  Environment Minister Nortbert Roettgen, who had sought the state governorship on behalf of the Christian Democrats, took responsibility for what commentators were calling the worst loss for the party in the state\u2019s history. \u201cThis defeat is bitter. It is clear and it really hurts,\u201d Roettgen told ARD. \u201cI lost this election. It was my campaign, and my topics.\u201d  Northrhein-Westphalia is a longtime Social Democrat stronghold, and it was a 2005 win by the CDU that spurred the early elections that brought Merkel to office later that year. Sunday\u2019s vote came a week after the CDU suffered losses in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, and after anger at German-backed European austerity policies contributed to the ouster of French President Nicolas Sarkozy and the Greek government. Greek government talks turn ugly But Josef Joffe, editor of the German weekly Die Zeit, said he expected Merkel to win a new mandate in the country\u2019s next federal elections, expected in 2013.  \u201cThere is no revolt the way you had a revolt on the left in France or the kind of revolt you had on the kind of neo-Nazi right and ultra left in Greece,\u201d Joffe told CNN\u2019s \u201cFareed Zakaria GPS.\u201d"

        "content": "It was Manchester City\u2019s big moment, a chance to show how far the \u201cnoisy neighbors\u201d from the blue half of town have come from under the shadows of their big rivals \u2013 but the day of wild celebrations ended with a humble apology to one of football\u2019s most iconic names. When Carlos Tevez lifted a banner proclaiming \u201cR.I.P. Fergie\u201d during a victory parade marking a 44-year wait for an English league title, it brought into sharp focus comments by Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson back in 2009. \u201cNot in my lifetime,\u201d the Scot said when asked if his team would ever be underdogs against City. United may not have been underdogs this season, but certainly had to play second fiddle as City won both league derby clashes and snatched the Premier League crown from Ferguson\u2019s team in the final minutes of the campaign, if only by the narrowest of margins. Arabian dreams: Abu Dhabi celebrates title success City officials, to their credit, moved quickly to say sorry. \u201cThe creation of the tasteless material is in itself reprehensible and in  accepting and brandishing it, Carlos has made a significant error of  judgment,\u201d said a club spokeswoman. \u201cThe club wishes to express its sincerest apologies to Sir Alex Ferguson  and Manchester United Football Club for any offense or distress caused.\u201d Tevez, who has history with Ferguson after his acrimonious departure from Old Trafford to join City in 2009, was also contrite.  \u201cI got carried away in the excitement of the moment and I certainly didn\u2019t  mean any disrespect to Sir Alex Ferguson, who I admire as a man and a manager,\u201d  said the Argentina international, who was given the banner by a supporter. Did City win the title - or did United throw it away? The incident took some of the gloss off an event that saw more than 100,000 people line the streets of Manchester to celebrate City\u2019s triumph. However, chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak was at pains to emphasize that the club\u2019s first title since the Premier League began 20 years ago is only a small step in the plans of City\u2019s Abu Dhabi owners, especially in context of United\u2019s 12 championships in that period.  \u201cManchester United set the benchmark for success for every club,\u201d Khaldoon said in an interview with City\u2019s website.  \u201cI have the highest respect for Manchester United and Sir Alex Ferguson. To get 89 points and not win the league is unbelievable.  \u201cWe are trying to accomplish just some of what Manchester United have been able to do in the past. We look at teams like United, Barcelona, Real Madrid, AC Milan and Bayern Munich and what they mean to their cities.  \u201cThis is one step in that direction but there is a long way to go yet.\u201d City\u2019s success has come, in large part, due to a spending spree of hundreds of millions of dollars on star players such as Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure, Tevez, Samir Nasri, Mario Balotelli and David Silva, and there has been widespread speculation that Arsenal\u2019s Premier League-leading scorer Robin van Persie will be the next big-money buy. But Khaldoon said the future emphasis would be on developing a new training and academy facility to nurture talent to comply with UEFA\u2019s new financial fair play rules. \u201cWe have a championship-winning team. We are not starting from the same point as in other preseasons,\u201d Khaldoon said.  \u201cWe have had to improve in a very dramatic manner. Now we have a nucleus of players who have won the FA Cup and the Premier League. To improve further we have to harness that nucleus and to improve in a tactical way. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see any major changes. There will be improvements but it will be in a very manageable way.  \u201cWhen you look at financial fair play, when you look at what the academy does for the community, how do we manage the evolution of this club over the next 10 years, it is fundamental to our growth strategy to have a continually successful program that produces young talent into the first team.  \u201cAlready today there are some wonderful young players in the academy and the reserve team, players who I think will be future superstars.\u201d Khaldoon said this season\u2019s success will help further City\u2019s goal of becoming one of the world\u2019s biggest clubs. \u201cToday we are a global brand, that wasn\u2019t the case three years ago. We go to the United States, Malaysia, China, Argentina \u2026 Manchester City has become an important club with a growing fan base,\u201d he said.  \u201cIf we are not there already, we are very close to being the most popular club in the Middle East. Asia is a huge market with a lot of potential and as Premier League champions that gives us a lot of benefits, the same with North and South America.\u201d Manager Mancini and his squad paraded the trophy on an open-top bus tour of the northern city on Monday.  To continuous chants of \u201cchampione\u201d there was a massive roar when the team first emerged on a raised stage in front of the historic town hall. Mancini and captain Vincent Kompany received the biggest applause when they came out last, carrying the EPL trophy they had snatched from city rivals and defending champions Manchester United in the dramatic finale. City beat QPR 3-2 Sunday with two goals in stoppage time from Edin Dzeko and Aguero to edge out United, 1-0 winners at Sunderland, on goal difference. Belgian star Kompany told the gathered fans: \u201cI want to say thank you, you guys have been amazing.\u201d Mancini added: \u201cI think that you should be proud of these players. They did everything for you. They wanted to win this championship for you.\u201d For United fans, there was also some consolation late Monday when the club announced that veteran midfielder Paul Scholes would play on for another season. The 37-year-old former England international midfielder came out of retirement midway through the campaign and  starred for the former champions in several matches.   However, Ferguson was not complimentary to City\u2019s spending policy when he talked about his postseason plans, with both clubs having been linked to young Belgian star Eden Hazard \u2013 who is expected to leave French club Lille. \u201cWe know City are going to spend fortunes, pay stupid money and silly salaries. We know that happens. We can\u2019t do anything about that,\u201d Ferguson told United\u2019s television channel.  \u201cWe are not like other clubs who can spend fortunes on proven goods. We invest in players who will be with the club for a long time, who will create the character of the club and the excitement for our fans. We are good at that and we are going to continue that way.\u201d Meanwhile, controversial QPR midfielder Joey Barton, who was sent off at the Etihad for elbowing Tevez in an off-the-ball incident, has been hit with two charges of violent conduct by the English Football Association. Barton, who departed early in the second half to leave his team with 10 men, clashed with both Aguero and Kompany on his way off the pitch. And while City celebrated their title success, Aston Villa manager Alex McLeish paid the price for a poor season which saw them narrowly avoid relegation. Villa, among the founding members of the English football league, announced in a statement Monday that McLeish had been sacked after just under a year in charge. The club\u2019s American owner Randy Lerner gave his reasons in a statement on their official website. \u201cWe need to be clear and candid with ourselves and with supporters about what we have lacked in recent years.  \u201cCompelling play and results that instil a sense of confidence that Villa is on the right track have been plainly absent.\u201d Paul Lambert, manager of Norwich City who beat Villa 2-0 on the last day of the season, is the early favorite to succeed fellow Scot McLeish.

Williams took just over an hour to take the 41st WTA singles title of her career in a 6-1 6-3 win over the world No. 1. The in-form Williams, who has won all 13 of her matches on clay this year, set the tone for a dominant performance by winning the first four games against an opponent that had lost just one set in the tournament before the final. Williams hit 26 winners past the Belorussian, taking four of her five break-point chances and denying  Azarenka\u2019s single break-point opportunity. \u201cI think Victoria is the player to beat,\u201d said Williams. \u201cShe has won I don\u2019t know how many tournaments this year alone. That\u2019s an amazing amount. So if you look at the stats, you just have to put her up there as the player to beat. \u201cI actually love the clay but my results haven\u2019t been stellar. I have won the French Open and lots of clay-court tournaments, though. It\u2019s really a myth about me not liking clay. I like it more than grass, which is weird.

        "content": "Efforts to form a unity government in Greece failed Monday, moving the country closer to a eurozone exit as the president called for another meeting Tuesday to seek a solution. Talks between Greek President Karolos Papoulias and the leaders of three main parties ended Monday night without a resolution, the president\u2019s office said. Papoulias then called a meeting for Tuesday to discuss the possibility of a government run by technocrats with support from political parties, according to the leader of the socialist PASOK party, which attended Monday\u2019s talks. \u201cWe have no choice\u201d but to support the idea of a technocracy, PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos said. Papoulias had invited the leaders of the New Democracy, PASOK, Syriza and Democratic Left parties to Monday night\u2019s meeting. Syriza was the only one not to attend; the party\u2019s leader, Alexis Tsipras, said he wanted to talk with all parties or with just the president, and not with a selected group. The far-left Syriza came in second in parliamentary elections on May 6, and polling since then has suggested it would come in first if the politicians call new elections because they cannot form a government. The debt-wracked country has until Thursday to either form a government or call new elections. Absent a government, Greece could run out of money to pay its debts and might crash out of the euro, the currency used by it and 16 other European Union countries. \u201cIf no government is in place before June when the next installment (of loan money) from the European Union and International Monetary Fund is due, we estimate that Greece will run out of money sometime between the end of June and beginning of July, at which point a return to the drachma would seem inevitable,\u201d Bank of America/Merrill Lynch wrote in a report released Friday. Syriza campaigned against the wildly unpopular government austerity measures that Greece \u2013 under the now-ousted coalition of New Democracy and PASOK \u2013 agreed to in exchange for loans by international lenders. The Syriza party\u2019s goal, Tsipras said Monday, is to remain in the eurozone without those \u201ccatastrophic\u201d measures. But although his party rode high in opinion polls immediately after the election, survey results released Monday suggested that many voters blame Tsipras for the current political deadlock. About two in five people say he is most at fault, according to the Rass opinion poll of 1,002 people conducted by telephone on May 10-11. About one in five people blamed all political leaders equally. About one in three people said Tsipras had taken the worst position during talks on forming a new government. The meeting called by Papoulias came a week after angry voters punished mainstream parties by backing a range of fringe groups and parties opposed to the government bailout. Seven parties won seats in parliament, but none captured more than 19% of the vote. That led to three failed attempts to form a new government. Democratic Left leader Fotis Kouvelis held his own meeting with Papoulias late Sunday. So did Nikolaos Michaloliakos, the head of the far-right Golden Dawn party.Michaloliakos emerged from those talks saying that any new government would need a premier with the international clout to reject the bailout package the previous government had signed, calling the deal \u201ca crime against our country.\u201d Venizelos said his PASOK party would do everything possible to form a national unity government, but it was ready for new elections, if necessary. The Communist party, meanwhile, called for new elections, saying it will not participate in a coalition government. The gravity of the situation was underscored Sunday by Tsipras, who told leaders, \u201cI am concerned that if we carry on with implementation of the bailout conditions in Greece, then Greece is at risk of facing a humanitarian crisis.\u201d His remarks were made in a private meeting, a transcript of which was released Monday. In the meeting, Papoulias said the New Democracy party, which has supported him, had two conditions: to ensure that the country remains in the euro and to renegotiate conditions of the bailout. In a poll published Saturday by the newspaper Kathimerini, four of five voters said they would vote the same way in a new election.  In a separate poll published Sunday by the newspaper Vima, seven of 10 people said they wanted the parties to form a coalition government. Syriza would come in first if new elections were held, the Vima poll suggested, after coming in second behind New Democracy a week ago with 16.8% of the vote. But the results would still lead to a deeply divided parliament, the poll suggested, with no party getting more than 21% of the vote. In the same poll, six of 10 voters said Syriza\u2019s plans against austerity are not realistic. Syriza is opposed to the terms of the bailout agreed to with the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund. The country\u2019s lenders have said that if Greece does not comply with the bailout terms, payments will stop.  The stakes are potentially huge, with concern stirring that the lack of leadership could jeopardize Greece\u2019s bailout agreement. That could lead to a disorderly default by Greece and force the nation out of the eurozone. A default by Greece also could drag down other troubled governments such as Spain and Portugal. Any financial shock of such a magnitude could plunge the region into a deep recession, with ripples being felt across the world."

        "content": "Matt Kuchar took home $1.7 million, the biggest prize in golf, for winning the Players Championship. It lifted him to a career-high fifth in the world rankings, but most importantly his family was there to see it. The American\u2019s wife and two young sons raced onto the green after he clinched his fourth PGA Tour victory, and biggest by far. Also at TPC Sawgrass on Sunday were his dad and mom, who live nearby in Ponte Vedra Beach.  \u201cIt\u2019s such an amazing feeling \u2013 playing amongst the game\u2019s best, to come out on top, to do it on Mother\u2019s Day, staying here with Mom and Dad, with my wife and two kids here \u2026 it really is magical,\u201d Kuchar said on the PGA Tour website. Kuchar, a top amateur who has never exploded on the professional scene, is known as one of golf\u2019s nice guys, a Mr. Consistent who has made the halfway cut in his past 17 starts and tied for third at the Masters in April. It didn\u2019t even bother him that his final-round partner was Kevin Na, the third-round leader who was battling inner demons and heckling from the crowd as he struggled to get around the course in his allotted time. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m so lucky to be doing what I do. I\u2019m out there, I\u2019m enjoying myself, having a good time. The smile is there because I\u2019m having a good time, because I\u2019m loving playing golf,\u201d Kuchar rold reporters. \u201cKevin knows that he\u2019s fighting some demons with pulling the trigger, and in trying to help himself, he walks really fast. So he tries to offset his difficulty in actually hitting the ball by walking fast, getting up to his ball and trying to keep a similar pace of play.\u201d South Korea-born Na, who is a naturalized American, collapsed with a closing 76 to finish tied for seventh \u2013 five shots behind Kuchar. \u201cI deserve it,\u201d Na said of the booing. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m being honest. But is it fair? No. You put an average guy in between those ropes, trust me, they won\u2019t even pull it back.\u201d Na had little sympathy from Tiger Woods, who suggested penalty strokes for slow players. \u201cStrokes is money. What people don\u2019t realize is that one shot is so valuable out here,\u201d the 2001 Players champion said after finishing tied for 40th, having closed with 73.  TPC Sawgrass is one of the toughest courses on the circuit, and even leading players such as Rory McIlroy struggle there. The U.S. Open champion missed the halfway cut for the third time at the $9.5 million tournament, but retained the No. 1 ranking after Luke Donald finished only sixth despite a closing 66. The Englishman was two shots behind a group of four tied for second, including last weekend\u2019s Quail Hollow winner Rickie Fowler, Texas Open champion Ben Curtis, 2007 Masters victor Zach Johnson and Scotland\u2019s Martin Laird. But the spoils went to Kuchar, who claimed his first win since The Barclays in 2010 and can now take his place among some legendary names to have triumphed at the Players. \u201cI think one of the things that strikes me is walking every day through the champions\u2019 tunnel,\u201d he said.  \u201cEvery player does it. And for me, I can\u2019t help but stop and gaze at all the photos going through champions tunnel, and to think I\u2019m going to be a part of that with Jack Nicklaus and Lee Trevino and Raymond Floyd and Phil Mickelson and David Duval and Tiger Woods, it\u2019s all the best of the best. \u201cTo feel like I\u2019m going to see my picture up there next year is pretty cool.\u201d"

        "content": "Roger Federer came from behind to beat Tomas Berdych to win his third Madrid title and equal Rafael Nadal\u2019s record of 20 Masters titles. Federer won 3-6 7-5 7-5 to continue a rich vein of form that has seen him lose just three times in 48 matches over the last eight months and ensure the Swiss will take Nadal\u2019s No. 2 ranking on Monday. The 16-time grand slam champion\u2019s ranking rise is significant because Federer could avoid playing No. 1 Novak Djokovic and Nadal until the final of the French Open \u2013 the second major tournament of the tennis season, which starts on May 28. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great spell and I couldn\u2019t be more happy right now coming off a break winning right away,\u201d Federer following his first ATP Tour tournament after a third-round exit in Miami in March.  The Swiss star struggled in his opening match before beating big-serving Milos Raonic in three sets, and grew in confidence on the controversial blue clay while Nadal and Djokovic fell by the wayside. Serena thrashes No. 1 Azarenka in Madrid final \u201cI was worried about getting through the first round and was not even thinking about who was going to be my second round opponent,\u201d Federer said after claiming his fourth title this year and 74th overall.  \u201cI was very realistic coming into this event. Confidence is coming back. I was away and it didn\u2019t take much for me to get my confidence back, especially now that I\u2019ve been playing so well for the past nine months.\u201d Berdych got off to the best possible start in Sunday\u2019s final, breaking Federer straight away for a 2-0 lead.  The Czech had a chance to secure the first set when Federer was serving, before Berdych closed it out on his own serve in the ninth game. However Berdych\u2019s service let him down at a key point in the second set\u2019s 12th game when he double-faulted, allowing Federer to pull level. Berdych squandered two break points at the start of the third set, and Federer sealed victory on his fourth match point after two hours and 38 minutes. Federer has now lost just four times to Berdych in 15 meetings, though the Czech player had won three of their past five matches, including a win in the 2010 Wimbledon quarterfinals. The tennis circuit shifts to Rome next week and a return to the reddish clay for the rest of the clay court season. That is likely to be a welcome relief for Nadal and Djokovic, who had been vocal in their criticism of Madrid\u2019s blue clay surface, particularly after their shock exits at the hands of Fernando Verdasco and Janko Tipsarevic respectively.

City had led the table on goal difference at the start of Sunday and Pablo Zabaleta\u2019s first-half goal suggested Roberto Mancini\u2019s side would comfortably win their first title since 1968. But a mistake by Joleon Lescott allowed Djibril Cisse to level and following a red card for QPR midfielder Joey Barton, Jamie Mackie popped up to head in the visitors\u2019 second goal to give United fans hope that their team might yet snatch the title from their city rivals. City bombarded the QPR penalty area and in stoppage time Edin Dzeko headed home to give their fans hope, before Sergio Aguero scored a stunning individual winner in a finale that no script writer would have dared pen. It was a goal that ensured City won the title on goal difference in the Premier League\u2019s 20th season, arguably the most dramatic finish in its history given it was decided in the last three minutes. \u201cTo win it like this is incredible,\u201d Mancini, who at times during the second half gave the impression he could barely believe his side appeared to be doing all they could to throw away the title, told Sky Sports. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a finale like this. \u201cWe didn\u2019t deserve to lose, we had a lot of chances and we deserved to win the game and championship. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic for the club and the supporters after 44 years. It\u2019s been a crazy season and a crazy last minute.\u201d In 1999 United won the Champions League final with two stoppage-time goals against Bayern Munich in Barcelona and Sunday\u2019s epic events bore parallel, though this time the Red Devils manager Sir Alex Ferguson had to suffer as victory was snatched away from him in those heart-palpitating final moments. \u201cI would like to say on behalf of Manchester United congratulations to our neighbors,\u201d said Ferguson. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic achievement to win the Premier League. It\u2019s the hardest league in the world and anyone who wins it deserves it.\u201d The rollercoaster game at the Eithad Stadium that wrung every ounce of emotion out of both City and QPR fans had consequences at the other end of the table given a Rangers defeat would have condemned them to relegation if Bolton Wanderers had beaten Stoke City away \u2013 and at one stage Owen Coyle\u2019s side led 2-1 at the Britannia Stadium. But a 77th-minute Jonathan Walters goal earned Stoke a 2-2 draw to relegate Bolton to the Championship and allow QPR \u2013 managed by former Manchester City manager Mark Hughes \u2013 to stay up in the Premier League. Arsenal finished third after a 3-2 win at West Brom to secure their Champions League place, while north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur beat Fulham 2-0 to take fourth. Spurs will join Arsenal in the Champions League only if Chelsea lose to Bayern Munich in the European Cup final on May 19. Newcastle\u2019s hopes of a Champions League place evaporated after a 3-1 defeat at Everton, though Alan Pardew\u2019s team have the consolation of a Europa League place. It is estimated that Manchester City\u2019s owner Sheikh Mansour from the ruling family of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates has invested close to $1.6 billion in securing this Premier League title. The title gives City\u2019s owners huge kudos, though not necessarily immediate financial benefits. \u201cIt should be remembered that there is a price of success, namely bonus payments to players and managers,\u201d financial blogger Kieron O\u2019Connor, who writes the Swiss Ramble blog, told CNN. \u201cIn fact, it is entirely possible that the net financial result might be negative for a direct comparison between finishing first or second, though it might be different if the comparison is against coming, say, sixth the previous season.\u201d It is a title that City probably should have wrapped up a long time ago. At one stage in December after their barnstorming start to the season \u2013 notably a 6-1 win over the defending champions at Old Trafford \u2013 City were eight points of United after beating Norwich 5-1. However, a combination of  Carlos Tevez going AWOL after falling out with Mancini, Yaya Toure\u2019s absence as he played for the Ivory Coast at the African Cup of Nations, David Silva\u2019s dip in form and Mario Balotelli\u2019s ill-disciplined antics allowed the defending champions to claw back that deficit and go eight points clear. But a disastrous April for United \u2013 including a 1-0 defeat by City at the Eithad Stadium \u2013 enabled Mancini\u2019s team to move top on goal difference going into the final round of matches. Sunday\u2019s games were broadcast to 211 countries around the world  \u2013 testament to the Premier League\u2019s global appeal. The remarkable end to the season could not have come at a better time for the league given it has recently announced the new tender for its next three-year broadcasting rights starting from the 2013-14 season. \u201cGames going down to the last game of the season will certainly increase interest and may in turn show the league as more valuable because of the unresolved title, Champions League and relegation issues,\u201d said lawyer Daniel Geey of Field Fisher Waterhouse. Sunday\u2019s 10 games also ensured this was the most prolific Premier League season ever with 1,066 goals, beating last season\u2019s record total of 1,063."

        "content": "Pastor Maldonado grabbed his first Formula One victory as the Venezuelan impressively held off Ferrari\u2019s Fernando Alonso to win Sunday\u2019s Spanish Grand Prix, but his celebrations were muted by a fire in his team\u2019s pit-lane garage. In only his second Formula One season, Maldonado secured Williams\u2019 first win since 2004 despite losing the early advantage of his pole position, thanks to some timely pit stops after Alonso raced away from him at the start. Maldonado\u2019s second pit stop proved key to his victory and Alonso then had to work hard to hold off Lotus\u2019 Kimi Raikkonen, with the Finn\u2019s teammate Romain Grosjean finishing fourth, while Kamui Kobayashi of Sauber was fifth and Red Bull\u2019s Sebastian Vettel sixth. Alonso and defending champion Vettel are tied on points in the 2012 standings after a race that produced the season\u2019s fifth winner in five races, though the German driver stays ahead on count back. Maldonado had started on pole after McLaren\u2019s Lewis Hamilton was relegated to the back of the grid on Saturday because of a technical fuel breach, which resulted in the exclusion of all the Briton\u2019s qualifying times by the race stewards. Hamilton fought up from the back of the grid to eighth, with teammate Jenson Button taking ninth. \u201cI think it\u2019s a wonderful day, not just for me but for all the team,\u201d said Maldonado. \u201cWe have been pushing so hard since last year to try to improve race by race and here we are.\u201d Spaniard Alonso added: \u201cSecond place at home feels fantastic and thanks to the people that came here and the people at home and hopefully a step forward in terms of championship possibilities.\u201d However Williams\u2019 celebrations at Maldonado\u2019s win were marred after a fire broke out in the team\u2019s garage just over an hour after the race finished as the Barcelona pit lane was engulfed in thick smoke. A number of personnel from the Williams, Force India and Caterham teams were taken to the medical center, though no serious injuries have been confirmed. Of the 31 people taken to the medical center, 24 were released and the remaining seven were transferred to local hospitals for treatment. \u201cAll the team\u2019s employees have been accounted for and four people have been taken to the circuit medical center for examination; one with a minor hand injury and three with respiratory issues,\u201d said Caterham. Formula One\u2019s governing body the FIA and the Spanish authorities have opened an investigation into the fire. Meanwhile, Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher\u2019s collision with Williams\u2019 Bruno Senna on lap 12 proved costly for Germany\u2019s seven-time world champion, who was handed a five-place grid penalty for the Monaco Grand Prix later this month. Race stewards decided Schumacher was at fault in the incident which forced the retirement of both drivers. "

        "content": "British businessman Charles Green has agreed a deal to take over Scottish Premier League side Glasgow Rangers, the club\u2019s administrators said on Sunday.  The former Sheffield United chief executive is leading a global consortium made up of 20 investors from the Middle East, Asia and the Far East. \u201cWe are very pleased to announce that we have accepted an offer from a consortium headed by Mr. Charles Green for the purchase of Rangers,\u201d said David Whitehouse of administrators Duff and Phelps. \u201cMr. Green has secured, via a substantial financial commitment, a period of exclusivity to complete the purchase of the club and this is expected to be finalized at a creditors\u2019 meeting on June 6.\u201d Neither Rangers, who have been Scottish champions 54 times, nor the administrators disclosed financial details of the offer from Green\u2019s consortium, but reportedly the deal is worth \u00a3$13.6 million. \u201cMr. Green, through a corporate vehicle, has entered into a binding commitment to inject funds into the Rangers Football Club plc so that the administrators can propose a Company Voluntary Arrangement which, if approved by creditors, will result in their claims being compromised for specific amounts and the company exiting administration free of the historic debt and with new owners.  \u201cIf the creditors do not approve the Company Voluntary Arrangement, the agreement obliges Charles Green\u2019s purchasing vehicle to acquire the business and assets of the club on agreed terms, through a newco structure. It is Mr. Green\u2019s strong preference to achieve a CVA.\u201d The Glasgow team\u2019s slide into administration in February was related to an unpaid tax bill of $14 million, incurred after businessman Craig Whyte bought the club in June 2010, but the UK government is also seeking $118 million allegedly owed in back taxes. \u201cI can assure you that there will not be any investor who owns more than 15%. I don\u2019t believe that any one person should own a football club,\u201d Green said. \u201cI think when we look around at certain clubs where one individual is in control there is no contingency and things are driven by their ability to sign a check.\u201d After entering administration, Rangers had 10 points deducted and will suffer a further points deduction if the club does not emerge from administration by the time the 2012-2013 season kicks off.

        "content": "Greek politicians traded insults and accusations following new talks with President Karolos Papoulias to broker a coalition government, an effort that will resume Monday.  Papoulias called together the leaders of the three biggest parties Sunday, a week after indecisive elections and three failed attempts to form a government raised the possibility of new elections in the debt-stricken country. His office announced late Sunday that those talks would continue Monday morning.  After the meeting, the leader of the radical leftist Syriza coalition said other parties wanted Syriza to be their \u201cpartners in crime,\u201d adding: \u201cWe can\u2019t do that.\u201d Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras suggested the two other largest parties, New Democracy and PASOK, were going to form a coalition with a smaller group, the Democratic Left. But the Democratic Left issued a statement calling Tsipras\u2019s remarks \u201ca disgrace,\u201d and accusing him of lying and slandering the smaller party.  Europe is keeping a nervous eye on Greece, fearing that the political chaos there could lead to defaults on debt that could threaten the future of the euro. Greek failure \u2013 or refusal \u2013 to make debt payments could hurt banks across Europe. The talks with Papoulias came a week after elections in which angry voters punished mainstream parties by backing a range of fringe groups. Democratic Left leader Fotis Kouvelis held his own meeting with Papoulias late Sunday. So did Nikolaos Michaloliakos, the head of the far-right Golden Dawn party. Michaloliakos emerged from talks saying any new government would need an internationally respected premier with the clout to reject the bailout package the previous government signed, calling the deal \u201ca crime against our country.\u201d If no government can be cobbled together by May 17, new elections must be called.  They would take place next month. Papoulias said he hoped he could help form a unity government, adding that \u201cthings in Greece are quite difficult\u201d \u2013 but things only looked more difficult after Sunday\u2019s talks.  Tsipras, whose party came in second last week on a platform of rejecting the conditions that international lenders have placed on the country, said that New Democracy, PASOK and the Democratic Left could form a majority government without the backing of his party. Polls suggest that Syriza, which came second in voting last week, would come first if another round of elections is held. \u201cThe three parties have 168 seats together. They can go ahead with that. They are pressuring us to participate, and that is an irrational and unprecedented request. They want us to give a fake sense of  legalization,\u201d he said. But the Democratic Left said it had not agreed to back a coalition without Syriza, and said of Tsipras: \u201cHis obvious inability to justify his stance should not lead him to slander and lie. This is an unethical political act on his part.\u201d Evangelos Venizelos, leader of the Socialist party PASOK, said after the meeting that his party would do everything possible to form a national unity government, but that they were ready for new elections if necessary. Venizelos had gone to Papoulias on Saturday to admit he could not form a government, making him the third politician in a week to fail to form a coalition. Antonis Samaras, the leader of the center-right New Democracy party, said before the meeting on Sunday that the voters had called for collaboration, change, and staying within the eurozone, the group of 17 European countries that use a common currency. Papoulias met Samaras, Venizelos and Tsipras together on Sunday.  The president will hold talks with the leaders of smaller parties later in the day. Independent Greek Party leader Panos Kammenos complained about the way Papoulias was organizing the meetings, saying all party leaders should meet together. The Communist party, meanwhile, called for new elections, saying they will not participate in a coalition government. Four out of five voters said they would vote the same way in a new election, according to a poll published Saturday by the newspaper Kathimerini. Three out of five said they believed new elections would be held soon, and just over half said they were not happy with the results of the vote on May 6. In a separate poll published Sunday by the newspaper Vima, seven out of 10 people said they wanted the parties to form a coalition government. Syriza would come top if new elections were held, the Vima poll suggested, after coming in second behind New Democracy a week ago. But the results would still lead to a deeply divided parliament, the poll suggested, with no party getting more than 21% of the vote. In the same poll, six out of 10 voters said Syriza\u2019s plans were not realistic. Party leader Tsipras made a radical speech last week against austerity. The Vima poll appeared to show a fall in support for Syriza since mid-week, when a survey put them first with 28% of the vote. In Sunday\u2019s poll they had the support of 20.5% of respondents. A poll by Metron analysis published on Saturday gave them 20.2%. Syriza came in second in last week\u2019s election with 16.8%. The party is opposed to the terms of the bailout agreed with the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund.  The country\u2019s lenders have said that if Greece does not comply with the bailout terms then payments will stop.  Deep uncertainty surrounds the political situation in Greece after large numbers of voters in last Sunday\u2019s election backed parties opposed to the country\u2019s bailout deal. Severe austerity measures are required under the terms of the bailout, agreed to by the outgoing coalition government of PASOK and New Democracy.  Headlines in Saturday\u2019s papers talk about \u201cElections on the Titanic\u201d and \u201cOpening the door to an exit from the euro.\u201d Greece has been forced to impose punishing austerity measures to get international loans that have kept it from defaulting on debts so far. But last week\u2019s election results were widely seen as a message to politicians to back away from the economic measures, which include policies to cut spending and raise taxes to reduce public debts. Seven parties won seats in parliament, but none captured more than 19% of the vote, leading to a week of political turmoil.  The stakes are potentially huge for the rest of the eurozone, the group of 17 European countries that use the euro as single currency. There is concern that the lack of leadership could jeopardize Greece\u2019s bailout agreement. That could lead to a disorderly default by Greece, which would force the nation out of the eurozone. A default by Greece also could drag down other troubled governments such as Spain and Portugal. The eurozone economy is fragile, and any financial shock could plunge the region into a deep recession, a development that would ripple across the globe. "

        "content": "Rickie Fowler rode the momentum from his first PGA Tour win to storm into contention at the Players Championship on Saturday with a 6-under 66 in the third round. The 23-year-old holed seven birdies with the only blemish coming on the 18th where he missed a 4-foot par putt to leave him 9 under for the tournament, three shots behind leader Kevin Na. Fowler won a playoff against world No. 1 Rory McIlroy at Quail Hollow last Sunday to win his first PGA Tour title after three runner-up finishes. The in-form American will be back in his familiar orange outfit for the final round on Sunday as he looks for back-to-back wins. He would be the first player to do that in consecutive weeks on the PGA Tour since Tiger Woods in 2009. \u201cI had some fun out there today,\u201d Fowler said after the shooting the lowest round of the day. \u201cI mean, other than bogeying the last, I\u2019d have to say it was a fairly perfect round.\u201d Fowler wasn\u2019t the only player to have problems on the tricky par par-4 18th. Charlie Wi and Adam Scott both double-bogeyed there to ruin promising rounds. Australian Scott is on 4-under, with Wi a shot better off. Na, though, ensured he took the outright lead heading into the final round by holing a 16-foot birdie putt at the last. The 28-year-old American had appeared nervy at times, taking numerous practice strokes before some of his shots and severely testing the patience of the timekeepers, but he enjoyed a bogey-free round of 68 to put him on 12 under. \u201cI\u2019m fighting with my balance over the ball. There\u2019s a lot going on and it\u2019s really hard for me to feel comfortable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating for me too. All I can do is try my best and do what is best for me to play well.\u201d Na\u2019s nerves will be further tested on Sunday when he targets the $1.7m on offer to the winner at Sawgrass. Matt Kuchar, who had shared the overnight lead with Zach Johnson and Na on 8-under, is one shot further back after mixing four bogeys with seven birdies for a 69. Harris English slumped out of contention with a 7-over 79. The 22-year-old rookie began the day a shot off the lead but hit a spectator on the head with his tee shot at the first and the shock seemed to unsettle him. He triple-bogeyed the next hole, double-bogeyed the fifth and had four other bogeys in a disastrous round. Woods had found some encouraging form in the second round with a run of four straight birdies moving him up the leaderboard but the former No. 1 didn\u2019t back it up on Saturday, an even-par 72 leaving him on 2-under for the tournament. \u201cI played well today and didn\u2019t get anything out of that round,\u201d Woods said. \u201cIt was probably the most solid I\u2019ve hit the golf ball all year actually. Even though I hit a couple off-line, they were just hit dead-flush. I just got nothing out of the round.\u201d English pair Luke Donald and Lee Westwood, both vying to replace McIlroy as world No. 1, failed to shine. Donald\u2019s level-par 72 left him on 3 under, while Westwood is another shot back after a 2-over 74. McIlroy missed the cut at Sawgrass for the third straight year."

Dortmund maintained their dominance over their Munich rivals with a fifth straight win. They won the German league title by eight points from Bayern.  \u201cThat was a cup final which no one from Dortmund could have better  imagined,\u201d Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp said. \u201cWe were ice cool in our finishing and scored great goals. It\u2019s hard to put  into words what has happened to us.\u201d For Bayern, it was the worst possible preparation for next Saturday\u2019s Champions League final against Chelsea, which will be played at their Allianz Arena ground. \u201cWe cannot complain. Our entire defensive play was a catastrophe,\u201d Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes said. \u201cWe have to take the blame and we did not deserve to win. \u201cWe still have a  major goal in mind and I think we will have all recovered from the shock by the Champions League final. That will be a completely different game.\u201d Bayern started shakily when a mistake by Luiz Gustavo allowed Jakub Blaszczykowski to set up Japanese forward Shinji Kagawa for the first goal after three minutes. The stage looked set for a close contest though when Arjen Robben made it 1-1 from the penalty spot on 25 minutes after Dortmund goalkeeper  Roman Weidenfeller tripped Mario Gomez. But Dortmund were 3-1 in front by half time thanks to a penalty by Germany defender Mats Hummels after Jerome Boateng\u2019s foul on Blaszczykowski and Lewandowski\u2019s first from a perfect Kagawa pass. Dormund all but wrapped up the win when Lewandowski scored his second in the 58th minute and though Ribery pulled one back in the 75th, Lewandowski pounced on an error by goalkeeper Manuel Neuer to head home for his hat-trick with nine minutes remaining. In La Liga, Pep Guardiola\u2019s final league game as Barcelona coach ended in a 2-2 draw at Real Betis. Daniel Martin scored two goals in three second-half minutes to put Betis 2-1 up but Seydou Keita salvaged a point for Guardiola\u2019s side with an injury-time goal shortly after Lionel Messi had hit the post. Dani Alves was sent off in the 53rd minute after receiving a second yellow card after Sergio Busquets had put Barca ahead in the ninth minute. Guardiola\u2019s final game will be the Copa del Rey final against Athletic Bilbao on May 25. Saturday\u2019s result means champions Real Madrid can win the title by nine points from their Catalan rivals if they win their final game at home to Mallorca on Sunday. Third-place Valencia lost to 1-0 at Real Sociedad to finish 30 points behind Barcelona in second. In Turkey, Galatasaray won the league title for the second year in a row after a tense 0-0 draw against Fenerbahce, who needed to win to deny their bitter rivals. The trophy presentation at Fenerbahce\u2019s stadium was delayed for several hours after angry home fans invaded the pitch and clashed with police. By the time the trophy was finally handed over, only about 200 fans remained in the stadium. Fenerbahce have endured a torrid season. Their chairman Aziz Yildirim is in jail awaiting a trial for match-fixing and the club were thrown out of the Champions League for their involvement in a scandal that allegedly affected 22 matches. However, the country\u2019s football federation recently cleared Fenerbahce and several other clubs of match-fixing following an investigation."

        "content": "While Rafael Nadal enjoys a fishing trip in his native Mallorca, Roger Federer is closing on his Spanish rival\u2019s No. 2 ranking and his Masters titles record after reaching the final in Madrid. Nadal, like Novak Djokovic, couldn\u2019t wait to get away from the controversial blue clay at the Caja Magica but Federer has made the best of the situation and thrashed Janko Tipsarevic 6-2, 6-3 on Saturday in a one-sided semifinal. Waiting in the final is Tomas Berdych, who beat a tetchy Juan Martin del Potro 7-6 (5), 7-6 (6) earlier in the day. Federer will move above Nadal in the rankings if he wins his third Madrid title, and will also equal the Spaniard\u2019s record of 20 Masters titles. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know actually about the No. 2 ranking,\u201d Federer said. \u201cI\u2019m focused on what I am doing here this week, trying to play well and get on a bit of a roll and I have played better and better as the tournament went on.\u201d Tipsarevic had knocked out fellow Serb Djokovic a day earlier, taking advantage of his compatriot\u2019s dislike of the blue clay surface. But in a match watched by Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo, Tipsarevic was no match for Federer, who hit 25 winners to take his head-to-head record over the Serb to 5-0. Federer\u2019s possible rise to No. 2 in the rankings is even more significant with the French Open looming. It means the 16-time Grand Slam champion could avoid playing Djokovic or Nadal until the final. The victory also took Federer past the $70m mark in career prize money. Federer will play in his 33rd Masters final on Sunday, while Berdych competes in his third. The Czech sixth seed took advantage of several lapses by Del Potro, who was broken while serving for the first set and then disputed a series of line calls in the second set. \u201cHe was my toughest match of the week,\u201d Berdych said. Del Potro refused to shake hands with the umpire after the match but said later: \u201cI lost because Berdych played better, and that\u2019s the only reason.\u201d Berdych trails Federer 4-10 in head-to-heads byt has won three of their last five meetings. Meanwhile, the ATP has confirmed that Australian journeyman player Sam Groth served a 263kph (163 mph) ace that broke the record for the fastest recorded serve. Groth, ranked No. 340, delivered the serve at a Challenger tournament in South Korea to smash the previous record held by Ivo Karlovic at 251 kph (156 mph). Federer described Groth\u2019s effort as an \u201cincredible number.\u201d"

        "content": "AS Roma hired Luis Enrique hoping a little Barcelona magic might rub off on the Serie A club, but the experiment came to a forlorn end on Saturday when the coach confirmed he was quitting after less than a year in charge. Roma boldly appointed the Spaniard last June, despite the fact that the 42-year-old had never played outside Spain and his only coaching experience was a three-year spell with Barcelona\u2019s B team. Ahead of the final round of the season, Roma are seventh in Serie A and may not qualify for Europe. They have been beaten 14 times. Amid increasing rumors about the coach\u2019s future, Roma general director Franco Baldini insisted the club wanted Luis Enrique to stay but the Spaniard has confirmed he will step down after Sunday\u2019s final game of the season. \u201cI\u2019m leaving because I feel very tired and drained,\u201d Luis Enrique said in a statement posted on the Roma website. \u201cI\u2019ve given everything this season. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to recover my energy over the summer \u2013 not the energy needed to motivate a group. I definitely won\u2019t be coaching next season, though I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d even have had any offers.\u201d Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola also cited fatigue when he announced he would quit the Catalan club at the end of this season. Luis Enrique will become the 20th coaching change in Serie A this season. He arrived at Roma in the wake of a takeover by a group of American investors led by Thomas DiBenedetto last April. On announcing the appointment, Roma\u2019s sporting director Walter Sabatini said: \u201cLuis Enrique represents an idea of football that we would like to follow, which imposes itself today through Spain and Barcelona. \u201cI was looking for someone outside of Italian football. Uncontaminated.\u201d Luis Enrique was charged with overhauling an aging squad and bringing flair to the team in a notoriously defense-minded league. The 35-year-old club icon Francesco Totti was left on the bench for some games, while Barcelona attacker Bojan Krkic was brought in, but failed to sparkle. \u201cI still believe you can play attractive football in Italy and I think the best way to do that is with attacking football,\u201d Luis Enrique said. \u201cI know that I have to improve defensive aspects and I will, don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d Baldini said Luis Enrique\u2019s departure wouldn\u2019t spell the end of the club\u2019s new philosophy. \u201cThe project hasn\u2019t failed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to carry on playing a certain type of football, and from league statistics Roma is the team that has had more possession than any other, and is third behind Juve and Milan for territorial dominance and pass completion. \u201cThis says a lot about the quality of play. The failure has been how our league campaign went, but the style of play was want we wanted from the beginning.\u201d Luis Enrique said he planned to stay in the Italian capital for several months to get to know the city better and that he would never regret his decision to try coaching in Italy. However, he said he wouldn\u2019t miss the local media. \u201cNearly everything that\u2019s been written was lies,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re still hearing them now.\u201d"

        "content": "Chanting \u201cthey don\u2019t represent us,\u201d tens of thousands in Madrid railed early Sunday against Spain\u2019s government and austerity cuts \u2013 venting their anger on the first anniversary of the so-called May 15 protest movement. Many ignored a government deadline to disperse by Saturday night from the central Puerta del Sol plaza, prompting police to clear the square by 5 a.m. on Sunday (11 p.m. on Saturday ET), the interior ministry said. About 30,000 attended the Madrid protest, and 18 were detained for resisting arrest or disorderly conduct, the ministry said. In the early hours of Sunday morning, demonstrators were a loud and vibrant presence in the square \u2013 as a large number of police, stationed at a nearby government building and along side streets, looked on and let them be. Throngs of like-minded demonstrators also gathered over the weekend in Barcelona and about 80 other cities around Spain.  Barcelona saw about 22,000 protesters, while Valencia had 8,000 and Seville had 2,000, authorities said. All the demonstrations were cleared by Sunday morning, the interior ministry said. The coordinated events marked the return of the \u201cindignados\u201d \u2013 or the outraged, as the protesters became known \u2013 who led Europe\u2019s first serious and significant grassroots movement against austerity and government budget cuts.  Similar demonstrations decrying governments\u2019 attempts to get their budgets in order, sometimes by slashing public funding, later emerged elsewhere around Europe.  In Madrid this weekend, marchers from the north, south, east and west descended on Puerta del Sol plaza on Saturday evening.  For hours, demonstrators shouted, jumped, sang and waved white handkerchiefs. Their most dramatic moment, though, may have been their quietest: when they held their hands aloft, silently, in a \u201csilent shout\u201d before erupting in cheers. The crowd is expected to return. The government has approved three more days of protests in Madrid, meaning similar scenes could play out into the middle of the week. The number of demonstrators in Madrid over the weekend appeared to be slightly fewer than those who had gathered in the same spot \u2013 in what\u2019s known as ground zero of the movement \u2013 a year earlier. Back then, protesters encamped in Madrid and other cities made their voices heard. The tens of thousands of people who turned out in the initial days grew to an estimated 6 million protesters over the following months, in a nation of 46 million people. Since then, Occupy camps around the world have come and gone. The new protests organized by the May 15 movement are different in at least one key respect: a new conservative government is now in control, having taken over in December.  Spain\u2019s economic crisis also has worsened since last year. The nation has slipped back into a recession, the unemployment rate has risen to 24% overall and more than 50% for those under age 25, and the government has enacted billions of dollars in austerity cuts, along with some tax hikes, to reduce the budget deficit. \u201cWe are really tired of this situation,\u201d said Madrid protester Paola Alvarado, a purchasing agent. \u201cAnd the new government is the same. They steal our money and give it to the banks.\u201d  Spain\u2019s austerity protests have been largely peaceful to date, with only occasional clashes between protesters and police, and some arrests in cities like Barcelona and Valencia. And prior the latest protests, the new government \u2013 which has vowed to maintain order and prevent a repetition of encampments in Madrid and beyond \u2013 urged police commanders to use \u201ccommon sense\u201d as to how they dealt with the latest round of public dissent. In recent months, Spanish trade unions, traditionally the protest leaders, have been at the forefront of demonstrations against the austerity cuts and labor market reforms, with the May 15 movement barely visible. \u201cMaybe the most important thing is it awakened a consciousness, beyond concrete changes, to make historic change possible,\u201d said Jon Aguirre Such, who was a movement spokesman a year ago but now spends more time on his architectural cooperative for urban planning.  \u201cI think everyone who took part in the May 15 movement made history. They can take away from us many things, but not our memory and our dream,\u201d Aguirre said. The original May 15 movement is credited with helping stop dozens of housing evictions. Activists pressured bank and court officials to delay or stop foreclosures on delinquent mortgages. But Ignacio Urquiza, a sociologist who has studied the movement for the left-leaning Fundacion Alternativas, said there has been little big-picture change as to government policies and operations. \u201cThe demonstrations didn\u2019t do more than expose \u2013 for a brief time \u2013 some issues. But Spain\u2019s economic crisis and political system have not changed. They are the same as last year,\u201d he said."

        "content": "Greek President Karolos Papoulias is to hold talks in the next day with party leaders in a bid to create a national unity government, his office said Saturday.  Evangelos Venizelos, leader of the country\u2019s socialist party, PASOK, met with the president Saturday after it became the third party to fail to form a coalition, a week after parliamentary elections gave no one a majority. Speaking after the meeting, Venizelos said PASOK, New Democracy and the Democratic Left have said they would be willing to go into a grand coalition on the condition of remaining in the euro, offering a possible way out of the impasse. But this could still be problematic as the Democratic Left has previously said it will only join a coalition if the party which placed second in Sunday\u2019s election, the Coalition of the Radical Left, or Syriza, also joined. Papoulias described this as a \u201cgrain of hope.\u201d  He said he hoped he could help form a unity government, adding that \u201cthings in Greece are quite difficult.\u201d Papoulias is expected to meet with the leaders of PASOK, New Democracy and Syriza at noon Sunday, his office said. He will meet with other party leaders later. If the president\u2019s bid to form a unity government does not succeed by May 17, fresh elections must be called. They would take place next month. Deep uncertainty surrounds the political situation in Greece after large numbers of voters in last Sunday\u2019s election backed parties opposed to the country\u2019s bailout deal. Severe austerity measures are required under the terms of the bailout, agreed by the outgoing coalition government of PASOK and New Democracy.  Headlines in Saturday\u2019s papers talk about \u201cElections on the Titanic\u201d and \u201cOpening the door to an exit from the euro.\u201d A poll earlier this week suggested that if new elections are held, Syriza would come first with 28% of the vote, although without achieving a majority. Syriza came in second in Sunday\u2019s election with 16.8%. The party is opposed to the terms of the bailout agreed with the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, and has even suggested implementing a moratorium on part of the repayments.  The country\u2019s lenders have said that if Greece does not comply with the bailout terms then payments will stop.  Greece has been forced to impose punishing austerity measures to get international loans that have kept it from defaulting on debts so far. But this week\u2019s election results were widely seen as a message to politicians to back away from the economic measures, which include policies to cut spending and raise taxes to reduce public debts. Seven parties won seats in parliament, but none captured more than 19% of the vote, leading to a week of political turmoil.  The stakes are potentially huge for the rest of the eurozone, the group of 17 European countries that use the euro as single currency. There is concern that the lack of leadership could jeopardize Greece\u2019s bailout agreement. That could lead to a disorderly default by Greece, which would force the nation out of the eurozone. A default by Greece also could drag down other troubled governments such as Spain and Portugal. The eurozone economy is fragile, and any financial shock could plunge the region into a deep recession, a development that would ripple across the globe. "

        "content": "Tiger Woods flirted with danger at the Players Championship on Friday before a run of four straight birdies helped him surge up the leaderboard and avoid missing the cut at a second straight tournament. But world No. 1 Rory McIlroy couldn\u2019t halt his run of poor form at Sawgrass, missing out on the final weekend for the third time in three visits after a 4-over 76 in the second round. American trio Zach Johnson, Kevin Na and Matt Kuchar are the joint leaders on 8 under, a stroke clear of another American, Harris English. Johnson had a 6-under round of 66 to join the leaders. Australia\u2019s Adam Scott is among a group of five players sitting another shot back on 6 under. Woods is on 2 under, six shots adrift of the leaders, but looked much more like his usual confident self on Friday after an opening 74. Woods was forced to sit out the weekend action at Quail Hollow last time out and had never missed back-to-back cuts in his professional career. A bogey at the par-4 fifth put the misfiring American at 2 over for the tournament and below the projected cut mark but he holed an eight-foot birdie putt at the testing par-3 eighth and that put him on a roll. Woods just missed with a 10-foot birdie putt on the 12th to end his run but he birdied the 16th to cancel out a bogey at the 14th and ended with a 4-under 68. The 23-year-old McIlroy followed his opening 72 with a disastrous 76 to leave him 4 over for the tournament and well short of making the weekend. He is still yet to break par at the tournament. \u201cI mean, hopefully, I\u2019m coming back here for another 20 years. If I don\u2019t figure it out on my 20th go, there\u2019s something wrong,\u201d McIlroy smiled.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a course that you have to figure out and it\u2019s taken me a while. I\u2019ll come back next year, my fourth attempt, and try to make it to the weekend.\u201d McIlroy\u2019s failure gives Luke Donald a chance to reclaim the No. 1 ranking as they continue their to-and-fro battle for the top spot. Donald is at three under, five shots adrift of the leaders. Defending champion K.J. Choi of South Korea also missed the cut after a second-round 76 left him 7 over for the tournament. Overnight leaders Martin Laird and Ian Poulter both slipped back into the pack. Poulter made an awful start was 5 over after two double bogeys and a bogey in his first six holes but recovered to record a 4-over 76, leaving him 3 under for the tournament. Laird is two shots off the pace after a 1-over 73."

        "content": "Lewis Hamilton only had a few hours to celebrate his third pole position of the season before the news filtered through that he had been relegated to the back of the grid for the Spanish Grand Prix because of a technical breach. Race stewards said McLaren had not put enough fuel in the Englishman\u2019s car and excluded all his qualifying times \u2013 meaning Venezuela\u2019s Pastor Maldonado will start on pole for Williams. Hamilton\u2019s dazzling final lap put him 0.578 seconds clear of Maldonado, but his team told him to stop his car on the track as he returned to the pits. McLaren tried to argue that Hamilton\u2019s low fuel was a \u201cforce majeure,\u201d but their protests fell on deaf ears. \u201cAs the amount of fuel put into the car is under the complete control of the competitor, the stewards cannot accept this as a case of force majeure,\u201d said the ruling. Formula One rules say that at the end of qualifying, drivers must have enough fuel on board to return their cars to the pits and provide at least one liter of fuel. \u201cWe accept that the stewards did not agree with our interpretation of force majeure,\u201d a McLaren statement said: \u201cOur aim is now to maximise the points we can score.\u201d McLaren chief Martin Whitmarsh conceded after the qualifying session that Hamilton could be penalized, although he argued that the Englishman\u2019s margin of superiority was so great that the low fuel would have made no difference. \u201cLewis and his team did a great job so it was a massive margin, by the situation within F1 at the moment, so undoubtedly he deserves to be there,\u201d he said. Hamilton had been in high spirits after what he described as one of his best ever qualifying sessions, but his demotion made it an awful day for McLaren. Hamilton\u2019s teammate Jenson Button will start 10th after failing even to make the top-10 shootout because of handling difficulties. Spanish eyes will be on Fernando Alonso, who will now start alongside Maldonado on the front row. The Lotus pair of Romain Grosjean and Kimi Raikkonen are on the second row. Red Bull had a far from perfect day. Mark Webber will start down in 11th after he was told by his team to come back to the pits in the second session believing the Australian had gone quick enough to qualify for the top-10 shootout. In the end, Webber, last year\u2019s pole-sitter in Barcelona, was nudged out. Double world champion Sebastian Vettel did make it through but didn\u2019t push for pole, preferring to save his tires for a race which is expected to be decided by tire strategy. Michael Schumacher opted to do the same and will start ninth in his Mercedes, just behind Vettel\u2019s Red Bull.  \u201cThere is nothing is wrong,\u201d Vettel said. \u201cWe decided to abort the lap to have a free choice of tires for the race. If I had set a lap, we would have to start the race on soft tires. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how it goes for tomorrow. We were a bit surprised how much of a step the others could do, but I\u2019m quite confident for race. We always have a  good race car. We have a couple of new sets which has proved successful for others in previous races this year.\u201d Button had been quickest in Friday practice but couldn\u2019t rediscover that pace a day later. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it went wrong. All day I\u2019ve struggled with balance,\u201d the Englishman said. \u201cI thought we would be reasonably competitive and at least get into Q3 but that\u2019s not the case. I haven\u2019t changed that much but struggled with the balance.\u201d Maldonado was quickest in Q2 and ended up on the front row for the first time in his career, far outqualifying teammate Bruno Senna who will start 18th. \u201cWe have been working so hard trying to understand these tires and to develop our car around these tires,\u201d the Venezuelan said. \u201cWe did a very good step forward for this race.\u201d Tire strategy is likely to be the decisive factor at the Circuit de Catalunya. Pirelli\u2019s tires have been under scrutiny all week, with former world champions Schumacher and Jackie Stewart saying they are dangerous. However, Pirelli claim they have only followed orders to help improve racing and make Formula One less predictable, and Vettel is among those to support the Italian company\u2019s efforts. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner believes they could be in good shape for Sunday\u2019s race, despite a less than spectacular qualifying session. \u201cGoing into the race with four new sets of tires is an advantage,\u201d Horner said. \u201cMark (Webber) has four sets of new tires and Seb has used one more set effectively so F1 is a strategic game.\u201d"

        "content": "Two dolphins who were rescued from a filthy pool at a Turkish tourism resort were released back into the wild this week after years in captivity. So far, the male dolphins have exceeded their trainers\u2019 expectations: Within 48 hours, satellite transmitters showed that Tom and Misha had traveled more than 100 miles, and they were observed hunting fish as a team and interacting with other wild dolphins. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable to see them travel this hard and fast,\u201d said Jeff Foster, a Seattle-based sea mammal expert who oversaw the dolphins\u2019 rehabilitation and preparation for release into the wild.             \u201cThe assumption is they\u2019re going back to the area that they were a pod in. They\u2019re definitely on a mission,\u201d Foster said. Foster spoke to CNN by telephone from a sailboat in the Aegean Sea, where he and his team have been tracking the animals\u2019 progress with the help of transmitters attached to the dolphins\u2019 dorsal fins.  Because of bad weather, the team hasn\u2019t been able to keep direct contact with the dolphins since their release Wednesday, although they are still able to track them via satellite. Foster suspects the dolphins are racing back to the waters around the Turkish city of Izmir where they were initially believed to be captured years ago. Tom and Misha are part of an expensive, ambitious and risky program sponsored by the UK-based Born Free Foundation, which is aiming to prove that captive dolphins can be reintroduced to the wild. For more than a year, Foster and his team worked in a quiet cove on the Aegean, teaching the two dolphins how to catch their own food.  He said the intensive training was necessary to get the dolphins ready to fend for themselves. \u201cIt would be like taking your dog and releasing it into the woods,\u201d Foster said.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t prepare your dog for that, it would never happen.\u201d When Foster first met these dolphins more than a year ago, he said they would eat only if humans placed dead fish directly in their mouths.   \u201cWe had literally thousands of fish in the pen, and they just wouldn\u2019t look at them,\u201d Foster said.  \u201cThey had just been so used to being hand-fed in a captive situation that they did not recognize fish as a food source.\u201d Foster has prior experience with another high-profile release program that ultimately ended in failure. He worked in Iceland more than 10 years ago as part of a multimillion-dollar effort to prepare the killer whale Keiko from the movie \u201cFree Willy\u201d for release back into the wild.   Less than a year after his release, Keiko died off the coast of Norway. But Foster said he believes Tom and Misha stand a much better chance of survival. \u201cThese animals haven\u2019t been in captivity as long as Keiko.  Keiko was held in captivity for more than 20 years.  He was held as a solitary animal for many of those years,\u201d Foster said.  Tom and Misha are each estimated to be around 12 years old, after initially being caught in the Aegean Sea five or six years ago.  \u201cThey\u2019ve probably spent the majority of their life out in the wild,\u201d Foster said.  \u201cBecause we\u2019re dealing with two males, you can develop competition feeding with them \u2026 they\u2019re ideal candidates for reintroduction back into the wild.\u201d Tom and Misha first attracted the attention of wildlife conservation activists in 2010.  At the time, they were being kept at a Turkish resort where tourists paid to swim with the dolphins in a shallow, filthy swimming pool. \u201cThe pool in Hisaronu, Turkey, where Tom and Misha had spent the summer months of 2010 had such a high bacterial count \u2026 that it was a significant health hazard to the dolphins and for the unsuspecting tourists who paid to swim with them,\u201d wrote Shirley Galligan, a representative of the Born Free Foundation, in an e-mail to CNN.  \u201cThe water was filthy with feces and dead fish and a layer of \u2018sludge\u2019 at the bottom.\u201d   According to Born Free, a nonprofit conservation group based in the United Kingdom, the dolphins were underweight and listless and would not have survived much longer in the pool, which \u201chaving been hastily constructed, was in danger of collapse from subsidence.\u201d A coalition of environmental groups successfully campaigned to rescue the animals and transport them in the back of a truck to a sea pen in the Aegean. In the final days before their release, Foster and his team attached specially designed transmitters to Tom and Misha. The tags, which are about the size of a cell phone, broadcast the dolphins\u2019 location via satellite and VHF radio. The sponsors of the program admit there is no guarantee of success. \u201cThere have only been a handful of reintroduction programmes with mixed results,\u201d Galligan wrote.  \u201cReturning any captive wild animal to the wild is never without risk.\u201d One of the few successful cetacean reintroductions on record involved an orphaned female orca named Springer.  Foster was a member of the team that helped rehabilitate the emaciated animal and eventually reintroduce her to a pod of related killer whales off of Canada\u2019s Pacific Coast a decade ago.  She has reportedly survived and thrived in those waters ever since. Michael Moore, a marine mammal expert at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, predicted major challenges for Tom and Misha. \u201cCan they break the bond with humans, and can they create a bond with other [wild] dolphins?\u201d he asked, in a phone interview with CNN. \u201cThe irony is that if these animals do get released into the wild, it\u2019s a big, bad world out there and they will have to learn how not to get entangled in fishing gear.\u201d According to Moore, Tom and Misha\u2019s release will have virtually no impact on the world\u2019s wild dolphin population, which faces an onslaught from industrial fishing nets, decimated fish stocks and polluted seas. But he and other dolphin experts say successful reintroduction could increase biodiversity awareness in Turkey and set an important example for the multibillion-dollar captive marine mammal entertainment industry. There has been a rapid increase in the number of \u201cdolphinariums\u201d and \u201cswim-with-dolphin\u201d programs cropping up across Turkey over the last decade.  \u201cTurkey, being a very popular and beautiful holiday destination, is sadly responding to the public demand for that \u2018dolphin experience\u2019 by providing more captive dolphin facilities than anywhere else in Europe,\u201d wrote Born Free\u2019s Galligan. \u201cConditions in general are very poor.\u201d Born Free did not publicly announce the day of Tom and Misha\u2019s release in order to protect them from curious onlookers. On Wednesday, after divers peeled away the last barrier separating the dolphins from freedom, the pair initially hesitated. \u201cThey sat in the pen for 15 to 20 minutes after we opened the gate.  These guys are cautious animals,\u201d Foster said.  Eventually, trainers gave them a hand cue to leave. Underwater video filmed by scuba divers shows Tom slowly turning and leaving the sea pen.  Misha then sped off after him. Within hours, the Born Free team photographed Misha flipping large local fish called mullet out of the water.  And then, they witnessed strange behavior from a dolphin rolling on the surface.  It took some time to identify the animal by its dorsal fin. \u201cIt was totally completely different dolphin!\u201d Foster said. \u201cA single dolphin that was interacting with Misha. Within the first four or five hours after we let them out, they were pursuing fish and interacting with wild dolphins.  It was everything and more than we expected.\u201d Despite initial encouraging behavior, Born Free is not yet celebrating. \u201cWe must remain cautious,\u201d the organization announced on its website. \u201cThere is still a way to go before we know 100 per cent that Tom and Misha have readapted fully to life back in the wild.\u201d"

        "content": "A day after Rafael Nadal exited the Madrid Masters and vowed never to return while the clay is still blue, a similarly disgruntled Novak Djokovic suffered a shock 7-6 (2), 6-3 loss to fellow Serb Janko Tipsarevic. The world No. 1 said he would join Nadal in boycotting the Madrid tournament next year if organizers did not restore standard red clay to the courts. \u201cI want to forget this week as soon as possible and move on to the real clay courts,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cIt took me at least a week to try to get used to this surface and somehow find a way to win matches and play a decent level of tennis. \u201cThere is no discussion in my eyes, it\u2019s very simple. No blue clay for me.\u201d Nadal lost to fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco on Thursday for his earliest exit in a clay-court tournament in eight years. Verdasco was routed 6-1, 6-2 by Tomas Berdych in Friday\u2019s quarterfinals. The blue clay is the brainchild of tournament owner Ion Tiriac, who claims it helps fans see the ball and creates a better viewing experience. And while Djokovic and Nadal have crashed out, Roger Federer has thrived at the tournament, beating David Ferrer 6-4, 6-4 on Friday to advance to the semifinals. The 16-time Grand Slam champion, president of the ATP Players\u2019 Council, said he sympathized with Nadal and Djokovic. \u201cYes of course, I said it from the start. It\u2019s not something we actually wanted,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand their frustrations. It\u2019s a bit tricky for everyone and we definitely have to look into things for next year.\u201d Federer will replace Nadal at No. 2 in the rankings if he wins the tournament, thereby increasing his chances of being seeded second for the French Open. Federer, who didn\u2019t face a single break point against Ferrer, will play Tipsarevic in the semifinals, while Juan Martin del Potro meets Berdych in the other after a comfortable 6-3, 6-4 win over Alexandr Dolgopolov. Serena Williams, too, has been in blistering form in Madrid and won a battle of former No. 1s in typically ruthless style, thrashing Maria Sharapova 6-1, 6-3 . Both players were unbeaten on clay coming into the match, but Williams extended her winning streak over the Russian to seven while winning her 10th straight match. Williams said the clay was \u201cextremely slippery\u201d but she wouldn\u2019t join the top men\u2019s stars in skipping Madrid next year. \u201cIf I\u2019m not here next year, it won\u2019t be because of the clay,\u201d said the 13-time Grand Slam champion. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any improvement in the courts over the week, but every clay court is different. \u201cThis is not the best court \u2013 definitely not  what they play like at Roland Garros \u2013 but it\u2019s what they use at Madrid.\u201d Williams will face Lucie Hradecka for a place in the final after the Czech qualifier upset  fifth-seeded Sam Stosur 7-6 (8), 7-6 (6). World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka avoided another upset when she recovered to beat French Open champion Li Na 3-6, 6-3, 6-3. She will play Agnieszka Radwanska for the sixth time this year in Saturday\u2019s semifinals, and said any complaints about the courts would have to wait. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of this court, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to sit here and complain about it. \u201cNothing is going to change this year. We can talk after the tournament about possible changes.\u201d"

The sculpture, created by artist Anish Kapoor and designer Cecil Balmond, has become a common sight on televisions across the globe in recent days, snaking up through the sky alongside the Olympic Stadium. But while many visitors to the park have been happy to study the swirling structure from the ground, or to ride to the top and enjoy the sweeping views it offers across London, others aren\u2019t so sure. \u201cI think it\u2019s amazing, it looks like a roller coaster,\u201d Raven, an 11-year-old local schoolgirl, told CNN on her first visit to the tower. \u201cIt\u2019s so ugly it becomes interesting,\u201d another Olympics fan said this week after visiting the sculpture. Earlier this year when the Orbit was first unveiled, London\u2019s mayor claimed it was better than the Eiffel Tower. Boris Johnson said the artwork, which rises up next to the Olympic Stadium at Stratford in the city\u2019s East End was \u201ca masterpiece of design and engineering.\u201d \u201cIt endlessly repays the viewer, it is a very rewarding thing to look at. The Eiffel Tower is very simple, the Shard, behind me, is a piece of cake \u2013 any child of two could do that \u2013 this is much more elaborate, more sophisticated, more intriguing and complex,\u201d he told CNN. The tower stands 114.5 meters (375 feet) tall, making it Britain\u2019s biggest sculpture, more than twice the height of Nelson\u2019s Column, almost six times the height of the Angel of the North, and 22 meters taller than the Statue of Liberty.  Visitors climb 455 steps \u2013 or ride one of two elevators \u2013 to two observation decks offering expansive vistas across London. Johnson and Lakshmi Mittal, CEO of steelmaker ArcelorMittal, joined forces to champion the creation of a large-scale sculpture at the Olympic Park \u2013 after meeting in a cloakroom at Davos. \u201cIt started as a small project, a casual discussion.\u201d Mittal told CNN in May. \u201cIt was just a scribble on a piece of paper. But it expanded and expanded into this exciting project.\u201d Mittal\u2019s company stumped up more than \u00a319 million ($30 million) of the \u00a324 million cost of the structure, providing steel from their plants across the globe. \u201cThe Olympics are a global games \u2013 the whole world participates, 202 countries. ArcelorMittal has businesses in so many countries around the world and so I wanted every one to participate,\u201d he said. Kapoor and Balmond won a competition to design the piece, and have watched it rise from the one-time wasteland, as the Olympic venues around it have also taken shape. Kapoor said the initial brief called for a tower on the Olympic site, \u201c100 meters tall, or more, and we\u2019ve done more,\u201d explaining that the work \u201cquestions the concept of what towers can be.\u201d \u201cAs you walk up, around and through it, it\u2019s as if the object is happening around you,\u201d he said when the sculpture was completed, adding that the Orbit \u201cdemands, requires, needs public participation.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all about being here, being involved,\u201d he told CNN. The artist conceded that the \u00a315 entry fee (\u00a37 for children) was high, but said it had been an expensive project, and that he hoped it would eventually be free, allowing more people to visit. Designer Balmond said the pair intended the sculpture to last far longer than the few weeks of the Olympic Games. \u201cWe hope it will be a monument for London, that will stand for 50 years \u2013 though it might need a paint job by then \u2013 and that it will be a beacon, drawing people to the area.\u201d Kapoor said he was ready for criticism: \u201cWhen you add such a big edifice to London\u2019s skyline, necessarily, people will scrutinize it, and some will be critical, and that\u2019s part of the process. We will see\u2026\u201d"

        "content": "It\u2019s the debate that just keeps going round in, well, circles. Are Pirelli\u2019s tires good or bad for Formula One? Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher has already said the tires are like \u201cdriving on raw eggs,\u201d while racing legend Jackie Stewart warns they are a danger. Now double world champion Sebastian Vettel has weighed in. The 24-year-old, who is leading the drivers\u2019 championship after four races, said racing was faster and more furious than ever \u2013 largely thanks to the Italian tire manufacturer. \u201cThe tires do see more degradation. It means we start to slide and then one guy slides more than the other because he puts his tires on two laps earlier,\u201d he said at a news conference ahead of this weekend\u2019s Spanish Grand Prix.  \u201cIt creates a different type of racing, more overtaking. Which I imagine is seen as better quality from the outside, simply because things happen. I think it depends what you really want.\u201d The Red Bull driver said racing had undergone huge changes since refueling was banned in 2010. With cars now carrying more fuel, the toll on the tires has also greatly increased. \u201cI think the races today \u2013 over the last two years since we have changed a couple of things \u2013 have become much better,\u201d he said. His comments are a stark contrast to compatriot Schumacher, who has been an outspoken critic of Pirelli.  When asked whether he thought Schumacher was \u201cjust making excuses for not winning,\u201d Vettel didn\u2019t answer. Mercedes driver Schumacher called on Pirelli to rethink its approach after several drivers struggled with tire degradation during last month\u2019s Bahrain Grand Prix. He was backed by McLaren team boss Martin Whitmarsh, whose drivers Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton both had tire troubles on the Bahrain International Circuit. Racing legend Jackie Stewart went as far as to say the tires were a danger, warning that drivers risked a \u201cmultiple-car accident\u201d unless immediate improvements were made. However Nico Rosberg \u2013 who finished fifth in Bahrain after winning in China the week before \u2013 also saw the unpredictability as a positive. \u201cIt\u2019s so on a knife\u2019s edge with the tires that it\u2019s good and it\u2019s great for racing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great, it\u2019s mixed everything up, lots of overtaking, lots of things happening, fantastic for everybody.\u201d Pirelli replaced Bridgestone as F1\u2019s tire supplier in 2011, winning a three-year contract. Unsurprisingly the Italian company argues it should be congratulated. The manufacturer claimed it was simply responding to calls for more unpredictable racing, with director Paul Hembery saying: \u201cWe are pushing the limits.\u201d When the Spanish Grand Prix takes place on Sunday, as many eyes will be on the tires as the drivers. Vettel missed out on the quickest time in Friday practice by 0.164 seconds to Button. Rosberg was third ahead of Hamilton as McLaren, Red Bull and Mercedes look set to battle it out for the podium places again. Fernando Alonso set Spanish hearts racing in the morning session by topping the time charts in his Ferrari, but was way down in 14th in the afternoon session, 1.201 seconds slower than Button. "

        "content": "It\u2019s been called \u201csomething Smurfs would play on,\u201d labeled a danger to players and derided over a lack of consultation.  Madrid\u2019s new blue clay courts have been the talk of the tennis world for all the wrong reasons. But is the furore justified? After all, isn\u2019t this the same surface \u2013 just a different color? It\u2019s the nature of sports stars to be hyper-sensitive about their office environment. As one British journalist argued, a malfunctioning computer can waste your morning\u2019s work, but a ridge in a tennis court might spell the end of a career.  The sport has undergone some of its most dramatic modernizations in the last two decades. Let\u2019s not forget the uproar when Hawk-Eye, the electronic ball tracking system, was introduced in the 1990s. But if the controversy over the last few weeks has revealed anything about tennis, it\u2019s that this is a game where tradition still looms large. Ion Tiriac\u2019s baby The man behind the blue revolution is Romanian billionaire Ion Tiriac. The former French Open doubles winner and manager to Boris Becker has had a blue bee in his bonnet for a while.  He pioneered the first blue hard courts at his indoor event in Stuttgart \u2013 a lead followed by the Australian and U.S. Opens. Tiriac argues the color increases the visibility of the yellow ball and points to scientific tests proving the contrast is at least 15% better on blue than red. The fact it\u2019s also the color of Madrid\u2019s major sponsor, Spanish insurance giant Mutua Madrilena, has not been lost on his critics. A court by any other name But really, it\u2019s just a color right? According to Tiriac the blue clay court is made exactly the same way as the red, with bricks ground into tiny fragments and spread over the ground in two different layers. However, in Madrid these bricks are stripped of their iron oxide (the chemical that provides the original color) and then treated with dye. Tiriac acknowledges the cost is almost double that of the red clay, but says the extra expense is worth it.  He admits that improving the experience for television viewers watching his $10.6 million tournament was a major factor in the switch. Players see red So what\u2019s all the fuss about? World No. 2 Rafael Nadal\u2019s shock exit in the third round on Thursday has only added fire to players\u2019 complaints that the new surface is too slippery. The \u201cKing of Clay\u201d \u2013 Nadal has won six of his last seven appearances at the French Open \u2013 was beaten in a three-hour epic by fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco. It ended a 22-match winning streak on clay for Nadal that stretched back to 2011, and was his first defeat in 14 meetings with Verdasco. \u201cI never was in control of the match, I didn\u2019t know how to win a point,\u201d Nadal told reporters, before suggesting he will not show up next year unless the controversial blue clay surface is changed. But even before his huge upset, the 25-year-old was critical of the new surface, tweeting: \u201cThe history of clay court was on red. It wasn\u2019t on blue. Only one person wins \u2013 the owner of the tournament.\u201d A slippery slope? World No. 1 Novak Djokovic also threatened not to step on Madrid\u2019s blue clay again after he lost to Janko Tipsarevic. The Serbian beat Nadal in last year\u2019s final, held on red clay, and he expressed his unhappiness with the new surface even after beating Spanish qualifier Daniel Gimeno-Traver 6-2 3-6 6-2 in his opening match on Tuesday. \u201cToday I played my first official match on blue clay and I have to admit I was not very happy. Next time I have to bring skates instead of shoes, it was sooo slippery,\u201d the 24-year-old said on Facebook.  Likewise, Ukrainian player Sergiy Stakhovsky tweeted: \u201cAfter playing a match on blueclay court 6 I can say with full responsibility on my shoulders that it is the worst court of @ATPWorldTour.\u201d In the women\u2019s draw, world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka also complained about the slide, telling reporters: \u201cThe surface is a bit slippery, but it\u2019s the same for all of us.\u201d It\u2019s not just the texture of the surface raising eyebrows \u2013 on the most basic level it just looks different.  \u201cHa! Blue clay.. It looks like something Smurfs would play on,\u201d tweeted player Ivo Karlovic, in what has become a catchphrase of the tournament. But it\u2019s not all blue. American star Serena Williams didn\u2019t see what all the fuss was about. \u201cI haven\u2019t noticed a difference between the blue and the red clay. I think it\u2019s the same, it\u2019s just you don\u2019t get as dirty,\u201d she tweeted. Technically speaking According to experts the lack of traction has nothing to do with the color but the implementation of the clay \u2013 which has been playing much faster than usually expected on such a surface. Alistair McCaw, a performance specialist to tennis stars including Jelena Dokic, has been watching the action close-up in Madrid. \u201cThe problem is not the fact that the color is blue, even though the change from the traditional brown is quite a shock. Let\u2019s not forget the Australian Open changing court color from the green to that bright blue! The players had a lot to say about that too,\u201d he said on his Facebook page. \u201cIt\u2019s that the amount of clay covering the surface is lesser than normal. If you dig your foot into the surface and remove some of the clay, you will notice that the underlying surface is a hard rubber-like mat. When water is sprayed on the surface, it become slippery. This, in my opinion, is what\u2019s causing the main problems.\u201d Former world No. 3 Ivan Ljubicic tested the blue clay at Madrid last year and admitted it did \u201clook a bit slippery.\u201d But the Croatian, who retired last month,  didn\u2019t believe it was a safety issue. Part of being a pro tennis player is adapting to different surfaces, he said.  And besides, the biggest challenge at Madrid isn\u2019t the clay \u2013 it\u2019s the altitude. Balls fly faster through  thinner air and Madrid is 650 meters above sea level.  \u201cI would say that grass courts and even the hard courts are a lot more dangerous than clay \u2013 any clay,\u201d Ljubicic told CNN. \u201cRegarding adaptation, tennis players face different surfaces on a weekly basis, every clay court is a bit different. I would say that the altitude in Madrid creates bigger problems to players than the color of the court.\u201d Eyes on the prize \u2026 no, the other prize The issue isn\u2019t just about Madrid, of course. The tournament is seen as an important buildup to the real clay-court crown \u2013 the French Open.  Players have argued it\u2019s difficult enough adjusting to the conditions in Madrid, without then having to change their game at Roland Garros at the end of the month.  Perhaps most galling for the top players is that they were never consulted over the controversial changes.  \u201cPlayers should be  agreeing to the change \u2013 there should be some value in what they say,\u201d Djokovic told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m not blaming the tournament, it is fighting for its own interests. But the ATP should have done a better job on player rights in protecting what the  players want.\u201d Ljubicic added that even when players did raise objections, they were ignored. \u201cPlayers were asked at the council meeting if they would support the idea of having blue clay courts. They clearly refused the idea \u2013 only to see that the decision was made anyhow that the surface will be blue,\u201d he said. The ATP has granted permission for a one-year trial of the tournament, and says it\u2019ll be taking into account players\u2019 feedback. Judging by the response so far, Tiriac will have a battle on his hands to keep blue in 2013. "

        "content": "For any professional woman, finding the right balance between work and family is never any easy task.  And when your office job is racing Formula One cars for a living, the leap between the daily grind and bouncing baby feels even wider.   It\u2019s a juggling act Maria de Villota will one day tackle \u2013 she\u2019s just got a few things to do on the track first. De Villota became the first female driver in Formula One in 20 years after joining Russian team Marussia in March in a testing role. She now works alongside Marussia\u2019s newly-formed lineup of German veteran Timo Glock and French rookie Charles Pic, and plans to get behind the wheel during the 2012 season. The 32-year-old Spaniard admitted it\u2019s been a hard slog to get there \u2013 and she\u2019s not going to give it up for a baby anytime soon. \u201cMy family is huge and we are all the time together. Of course I would like to have the same thing for me. If you have a baby, I don\u2019t know how my body, my mind, is going to react,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cIf one day I do make that decision I\u2019ll make sure that all my racing goals are achieved. I need to make sure of what I\u2019m thinking  \u2013 which is being competitive and not about a little kid waiting at home for me.\u201d But de Villota is proof that kids and the track can mix, having grown up the daughter of former F1 driver Emilio de Villota. \u201cHe was a driver in the late \u201970s, early \u201880s and I used to go to see him race. I remember the moment when he would tell me, \u2018Please hold my helmet.\u2019 It was really good having that chance being beside him,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he didn\u2019t want me to be a racing driver but in the end I just wanted to be like him.\u201d Considering her racing family, it\u2019s no surprise De Villota took to the track at an early age \u2013 an experience that gave her a taste of her dream job. \u201cMy racing career started in Madrid, where I was born, in a go-kart track,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember it was Christmas time and my brother had a go-kart and I had my first drive that day. I was around five and I just went all the way into the front. \u201cHe was crying and saying, \u2018You\u2019re crazy, I\u2019m not going to share with you anymore.\u2019 \u201c De Villota is the first woman to be part of the elite motorsport since Italy\u2019s Giovanni Amati entered three grands prix for Brabham in 1992, but failed to qualify for a race. Just weeks after De Villota signed with Marussia, 29-year-old Briton Susie Wolff joined Williams as a test driver. Wolff is just the seventh female F1 driver in the 60-year history of the sport and her recruitment, along with De Villota, was seen as an important step forward in the gender divide. It hasn\u2019t been an easy ride, though. \u201cBeing a woman didn\u2019t stop me. I realized I could do it and I could do it good,\u201d De Villota said. \u201cEndurance has been tough because we\u2019re not as strong as men. I had to work really hard in order to make sure I could be strong enough to be driving Formula One.\u201d "

        "content": "Greek politicians have been unable to form a new government in their economically embattled land late Friday, and the president might have to step in to breach the impasse. Socialist PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos met with Antonis Samaras, head of the center-right New Democracy party, and Alexis Tsipras of the leftist Syriza party and failed to forge a deal, the parties reported. Venizelos was the third Greek politician since Sunday tasked with forming a new government. Samaras and Tsipras had tried and already failed to organize a government.  Venizelos is to meet with President Karolos Papoulias and tell him he can\u2019t form a coalition, government officials said. Papoulias will call the party leaders and ask them to try and form a national unity government.  If a unity government can\u2019t be formed by Thursday, Greece must call new elections.  The political wrangling comes after Sunday\u2019s national elections in which seven parties won seats in parliament, but none captured more than 19% of the vote.  Greece has been forced to impose punishing austerity measures to get international loans that have kept it from defaulting on debts. But this week\u2019s election results were widely seen as a message to politicians to back away from the harsh economic austerity measures, policies of cutting spending and raising taxes to reduce public debts. Voters backed parties on the far left and right, withholding support from PASOK and New Democracy, the more moderate parties that made up the coalition that enacted austerity measures. The stakes are potentially huge for the rest of the eurozone, the group of 17 European countries that use a common currency. There is concern that the lack of leadership could jeopardize Greece\u2019s bailout agreement with the European Union and International Monetary Fund. That could lead to a disorderly default by Greece, which would force the nation out of the eurozone. A default by Greece also could drag down other troubled governments such as Spain and Portugal. The eurozone economy is fragile, and any financial shock could plunge the region into a deep recession, a development that would ripple across the globe. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is the most outspoken supporter of fiscal discipline in the eurozone. Other leaders have been ousted by voters frustrated with austerity. France\u2019s President-elect, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, campaigned against austerity and has promised to push through measures to boost economic growth.  Venizelos said Sunday\u2019s fragmented results in the Greek election show voters don\u2019t trust \u201cany party on its own.\u201d But he has said he wants Greece to stay in the eurozone. Samaras said his New Democracy party would be willing to participate in a national unity government \u201cprovided it ensures Greece\u2019s stay in the euro\u201d and a revision of the bailout agreements with the country\u2019s foreign lenders. Earlier, Samaras said it will be tough to form a \u201cviable government,\u201d but he said, \u201cThere is still hope.\u201d Speaking to other members of parliament earlier, Samaras accused the leftist Syriza party, which placed second in the elections, of \u201cpopulism\u201d and a desire to take the country to new elections. Samaras said any new elections would mark a battle \u201cbetween the pro-European parties and the anti-European left.\u201d Tsipras said Greece is no longer bound by austerity promises made in return for rescue loans. Tsipras has also demanded an examination of Greece\u2019s massive debt and a moratorium on part of its repayment.  Tsipras said Venizelos wants a government participating in the policy of the bailout. But Tsipras said \u201cthe refusal to take part is not given by Syriza but by the Greek people.\u201d \u201cVenizelos and Samaras are sticking to the points that they signed in the bailout,\u201d Tsipras said after meeting with Venizelos. \u201cThey want a pro-bailout government with a left alibi.\u201d \u201cNo government has the right to stick to the measures of the bailout,\u201d Tsipras said.  An opinion poll Thursday shows that Syriza would come in first if fresh elections were held, with nearly 28% of the vote, much higher than the 16.8% that landed the party into second place during this week\u2019s elections.  PASOK and New Democracy, the two parties that have been dominating political life in Greece for decades, have seen their popularity plummet as a result of the two bailouts and the austerity measures dictated in the programs. The poll shows that if elections were held New Democracy would slightly increase its position to 20.3%, while Pasok\u2019s popularity would suffer an even steeper decline to 12.6%.  Last year, Greece\u2019s debt threatened to force it to drop Europe\u2019s common currency, the euro, prompting the European Central Bank and other lenders to swoop in with emergency funding. In exchange, they demanded that the government slash spending. The resulting measures have led to tax increases and cuts in jobs, wages, pensions and benefits \u2013 and significant public outcry. The national unemployment rate for January, the latest month for which figures are available, was nearly 22%, prompting widespread protests and leading some young people to leave the country in search of work.  Youth unemployment is even higher than the national average of one in five out of work. For two years, the country\u2019s massive amount of debt has threatened the stability of the eurozone. Greece pushed through a huge debt swap in March to save it from disorderly default and clear the way for it to receive a second bailout from the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, worth \u20ac130 billion ($171.5 billion). The debt restructuring deal gave some breathing space to the eurozone bloc, where fears that Greece might collapse had increased pressure on other debt-laden nations such as Spain and Italy."

        "content": "Many said he only left Barcelona for the money. After all, he reportedly earns more than $300,000 a week in England. Why else would you leave the world\u2019s most successful club? Yaya Toure, however, insists that he came to Manchester City in 2010 for one reason \u2013 to make history. He could be proved right on Sunday, when City\u2019s expensively-assembled squad have the chance to win a first English league title in 44 years. Such a success is but a small part of the dream held by the Premier League club\u2019s Abu Dhabi owners, and Toure \u2013 who last season ended City\u2019s 35-year wait for a trophy by scoring the only goal of the FA Cup final \u2013 is a key figure in their master plan. \u201cWhen City wanted to sign me from Barcelona, they were thinking about bringing a good player to try to add to the club and make history in four years,\u201d the Ivory Coast international told CNN.  \u201cI think this is very interesting for me and for the club because I think they\u2019ve made the right choice. We gained a couple of fantastic players, this year we\u2019re doing fantastically well. We have one more game, a very difficult game against QPR, although we hope we will win this game because it is very important.\u201d \u201cImportant\u201d perhaps does not do justice to Sunday\u2019s home match against a Queens Park Rangers team battling to avoid relegation. City top the table from defending champions and fierce local rivals Manchester United by goal difference alone. If both teams have the same result this weekend then it will be the closest finish to an English season since Arsenal pipped Liverpool to the title in 1989 on number of goals scored. But perhaps even more crucially, it will tip the balance of power away from United \u2013 a club seeking a record-extending 20th league crown. \u201cIf you want to make history you have to win,\u201d Toure said. \u201cLast year we did it when we won the FA Cup, and this year with the signings we have I think we have to win something for this club.  \u201cThe fans were amazing this year, incredible, and they helped us a lot in difficult moments and good moments, so I think we\u2019ve done everything for them. If we can win this title I think it will be for the fans and for the club.\u201d City thrashed United 6-1 at Old Trafford in October as Roberto Mancini\u2019s men led the table by five points, but Alex Ferguson\u2019s side bounced back to move eight points clear at the top with six games to go. City struggled in the wake of Carlos Tevez\u2019s fallout with Mancini, a controversy that saw the club\u2019s former captain and top scorer go missing for three months. Just as crucially, Toure was away for six weeks at the African Nations Cup, depriving City\u2019s midfield of its driving force. Add to that the on and off-field indiscretions of Mario Balotelli, and it appeared that City\u2019s stars were shooting themselves in the foot. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s difficult because when you have an important, quality player like that and they make something wrong, sometimes it\u2019s difficult because football is a game for all the group,\u201d Toure said.  \u201cIt\u2019s 11 players, 45 players who live together, you see each other more than you see your family, and you have to be careful because when one of your teammates is wrong it can affect almost all the other players.  \u201cBut I think this year we dealt with everything. Carlos is a fantastic player who we always hoped would come back because he is a really important player for us. Yeah he made a mistake but he\u2019s apologized to everyone and he\u2019s showed to the fans he\u2019s there to fight for his friends for the title.\u201d Mancini has been criticized for his management methods since coming to England from Italian champions Inter Milan in mid-2009, but Toure credits him for inspiring belief that the title race was not over. \u201cWhen I was coming to City, it was Mancini taking me there. He believes in me \u2026 when I was playing with Monaco he sent someone to look at me because last time he wanted to bring me to Inter because he was there,\u201d Toure said.  \u201cI think the key was when Mancini started making a speech in the dressing room and said, \u2018Guys we don\u2019t have to give up because the Premier League is like that and maybe they can drop some points and we can come back. We have to believe to the end because we\u2019re in the most competitive competition in the world and most importantly we have to keep going, keep winning and maybe we\u2019ll be close to them.\u2019  \u201cI think Mancini was totally right because we never gave up and we continued to fight to the final, and now we have the same points, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d Next season City will play in the Champions League for the second successive time. Their introduction this season will always be remembered for Tevez\u2019s clash with Mancini in Munich, which precipitated a group-stage exit from Europe\u2019s premier club tournament. Toure has already held that trophy aloft, in 2009 when Barcelona completed a treble of trophies also including the Spanish league and cup crowns. \u201cThe Champions League is one of the biggest competitions in the world, it\u2019s very tough and all the best teams in the world play in this competition,\u201d Toure said.  \u201cYes I\u2019ve already won it but I\u2019ve said I came to City to make history and most importantly I have to keep working hard and make me believe I can be part of history at this amazing club. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough but I think we\u2019re on a good way to being a big team.\u201d Bayern Munich won City\u2019s group and went on to reach the May 19 final, which will be held at the German team\u2019s home stadium. England will be represented by Chelsea, who overcame considerable odds to beat defending champions Barca in the semis. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough because Bayern is a fantastic team. Two years ago they lost (the final) against Inter Milan, but I think Chelsea are doing extremely well, they are fighting together,\u201d Toure said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough for them because Bayern Munich have not stopped winning. But I hope an English team can win and the guys can say the Premier League is one of the toughest competitions in the world.\u201d"

        "content": "Rebekah Brooks, a former newspaper editor and News Corp. executive, was grilled Friday about her close relationship with Prime Minister David Cameron and other top politicians at a UK inquiry into media ethics.  Brooks detailed frequent contacts with Cameron in the run-up to the 2010 election and said she had received commiserations from the prime minister when she resigned from News International last summer. She said the message, along the lines of \u201ckeep your head up,\u201d was among a number of \u201cindirect messages\u201d of sympathy that top politicians sent to her. Brooks resigned as chief executive of News International, the British arm of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp., in July amid public outrage over claims of widespread hacking by staff at its News of the World newspaper. The government-appointed Leveson Inquiry, set up in response to the accusations of phone hacking by the News of the World, is examining the links between Britain\u2019s media and politics. Brooks\u2019 testimony about the contacts she had with Britain\u2019s current and former prime ministers could prove embarrassing to them if it reveals too close a relationship. And her evidence surrounding News Corp.\u2019s bid to take over full ownership of British satellite broadcaster BSkyB may prompt further questions. Brooks, who said she had an \u201cinformal role\u201d in lobbying for the bid, told the inquiry she had discussed it with both Cameron and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne. An e-mail from a News Corp. employee to Brooks also suggested Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt had asked him to advise privately on how News International was dealing with the phone hacking allegations, the inquiry heard. The employee is known to have referred to contact with Hunt \u2013 the Cabinet minister who oversees British broadcasting and who was charged with making an impartial decision on the bid \u2013 when he in fact dealt with Hunt\u2019s aide. The aide was forced to resign last month over revelations of apparent back-channel communications between his office and News Corp. over the bid. The controversial bid was eventually abandoned last summer amid the furor over the phone hacking scandal. Brooks said her discussion of the takeover with Cameron was not in depth, and that he made it clear it was not his decision to make. She also argued in favor of the bid to Osborne over dinner, but he was not explicitly supportive of it, Brooks said. It was an appropriate conversation to have, she told inquiry lawyer Robert Jay, as she was entitled to reflect the opposite view to what Osborne had heard from many other news outlets. In the closing minutes of her five hours of testimony \u2013 during which she appeared largely composed but grew more testy as time wore on \u2013 Brooks defended her position as an editor and chief executive. She said \u201cmuch has been made of cozy relationships and informal contacts\u201d between journalists and politicians, but that it came down to individuals to ensure their conduct was professional. The system is not perfect, she told the judge overseeing the inquiry, Lord Justice Leveson, but the current government has taken steps to improve transparency about meetings between the press and politicians. Brooks said the phone hacking scandal increasingly occupied her time in her final months at News International. But she denied being a \u201cgo-between\u201d in an increasingly fraught relationship between Rupert Murdoch and his son James, and she dismissed the suggestion the younger Murdoch had sought to shift the blame to subordinates. Brooks also said she never witnessed any inappropriate dealings with the police. Brooks has been arrested twice and released on bail in connection with police investigations into the scandal. She denies any knowledge of phone hacking on her watch. The ongoing investigations mean questioning on the issue of phone hacking is limited, so as not to prejudice them or any future trial. Questioned over her relationship with Cameron, a family friend of her husband\u2019s, Brooks said she had met him \u201cprobably three or four times\u201d in the five months leading up to the May 2010 election. She said they would exchange text messages once or twice a week but denied reports that there were as many as 12 texts a day. The messages were signed off \u201cDC\u201d in the main, she said. Occasionally he would sign them off \u201d \u2018LOL,\u2019 lots of love, until I told him it meant \u2018laugh out loud,\u2019 when he didn\u2019t sign them off like that any more,\u201d she said. Asked if she and Cameron had discussed the phone hacking allegations against News of the World, she said they had done so in very general terms. In late 2010, they had a more detailed discussion, she said, because civil cases were in court and the issue was in the news. Brooks was editor of News of the World in 2002 when the newspaper hacked the voice mail of a missing schoolgirl, Milly Dowler, who was later found dead. The hacking scandal led to the paper\u2019s closure in 2011. Brooks then edited The Sun, Britain\u2019s biggest-selling daily tabloid, from 2003 to 2009. Cameron has said the relationship between the media and politicians has become \u201ctoo cozy.\u201d He is expected to appear before the inquiry in the coming weeks. Testifying Friday, Brooks told the inquiry she had received \u201cindirect messages\u201d of sympathy on her resignation in July, from 10 Downing Street, 11 Downing Street, the Home Office and the Foreign Office. A \u201cvery few\u201d Labour politicians sent messages of commiseration, Brooks said. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair sent her a message, but his successor, Gordon Brown, did not, she said. Blair\u2019s Labour Party benefited from the support of The Sun in three elections, but the paper switched allegiance to the Conservatives before the 2010 election in which Brown lost power. In 2009, \u201cwe were running out of ways to support Mr. Brown\u2019s government,\u201d Brooks said, explaining what lay behind the paper\u2019s shift to Cameron in September that year. She also said Brown had been \u201cincredibly aggressive and very angry\u201d in a phone call to her after The Sun published stories critical of his handling of a condolence letter to the family of a soldier killed in Afghanistan. Brooks defended The Sun\u2019s handling of an article it published in 2006 about Brown\u2019s infant son, Fraser, having cystic fibrosis, which the former prime minister criticized in 2011. Brooks denied the paper had illegally accessed Fraser\u2019s medical records. She did not reveal The Sun\u2019s source for the article but said the Browns had given permission for the paper to run it. She said Brown had not raised concerns in the intervening years, when they continued to meet socially, and that \u201cMr. Brown\u2019s recollections of that time were not the same as my own.\u201d Asked Friday if there was a danger that her newspaper got too close to those in power and their \u201cspin doctors,\u201d Brooks said the job of journalists was to question what they were told and serve their readers. Brooks acknowledged becoming friendly with Blair by the end of his decade in power but said she was less friendly with Brown. She was more friends with Brown\u2019s wife, Sarah, Brooks said.  She had known Blair for more than a decade, she said, with many social and political meetings in the time he was prime minister. They also spoke on the phone and had dinners together. Brooks and her husband, Charlie Brooks, live near Cameron\u2019s constituency home and have socialized together. She attended a private birthday party for Cameron in late 2010. Questioned about her working relationship with Rupert Murdoch, Brooks said she was close to him and believed he trusted her implicitly. But she rejected the suggestion that politicians thought they had to go through her to get close to Murdoch. Brooks acknowledged she had made friendships during her years as a journalist, editor and chief executive but said she was always aware that she was a journalist and they were politicians, and assumed they also were.  Asked whether The Sun engendered fear in politicians, Brooks said she did not see them as people who were easily scared. Jay, the inquiry lawyer, pressed Brooks over her newspaper\u2019s role in putting pressure on the Cameron government, particularly Home Secretary Theresa May, to review the case of Madeleine McCann, a child abducted in Portugal. Brooks said The Sun had tried to persuade the government to open a review but said \u201cthreat\u201d was too strong a word to describe its efforts. Brooks\u2019 appearance at the Leveson Inquiry came a day after fellow ex-News of the World editor Andy Coulson, who became director of communications for Cameron after he quit the paper, took to the stand. Critics have questioned Cameron\u2019s judgment in hiring Coulson in 2007 and asked why he was not subjected to more rigorous security vetting.  Coulson resigned as Cameron\u2019s spokesman in January 2011 when police opened a new investigation into the scandal. He insisted he was innocent but said he had become a distraction for the government. Questioned Thursday, Coulson said the jailing of two News of the World employees over phone hacking in 2007 did come up in discussions with senior party members before his job offer. He told the inquiry he had told them and Cameron what he has said repeatedly \u2013 that he knew nothing about the practice of hacking under his leadership of the paper. Coulson said he never witnessed a conversation that was \u201cinappropriate\u201d between members of the government and News International. He dismissed as a conspiracy theory the suggestion that Conservatives had struck some kind of deal on News Corp.\u2019s takeover of BSkyB in return for Murdoch\u2019s support."

        "content": "For the past week, members of Britain\u2019s armed forces have been taking part in major exercises to prepare for the Olympics in London later this summer. Alongside the emergency drills and simulated alarms, designed to ready the city for potential terror threats to the 2012 Games, soldiers have also practiced launching missiles from the city\u2019s rooftops. The residents of an exclusive apartment complex in London\u2019s East End were horrified to discover that the UK Ministry of Defence planned to site ground-to-air rocket launchers from the roof of their homes. Now one historian has called on them to channel the spirits of the factory workers who once worked where they now live, and insist that the missiles are removed. Today Bow Quarter is an upscale gated community, complete with swimming pool, gymnasium, private gardens and its own restaurant, bar and shop. Makeup artist Susan Aherne, who has lived in the complex for 18 months, told CNN she was attracted to the complex by its air of security \u2013 but now fears the missiles will mean her home becomes a terrorist target. \u201cI\u2019m frightened of getting my head blown off,\u201d she said. \u201cI moved here because it\u2019s a gated community and it made me feel safe, but now it feels like we\u2019re living inside some military compound. They say it\u2019s going to make us safe, but in fact it\u2019s going to make us a target. They\u2019re going to convert a residential area into a war zone.\u201d And security guard Mohammed Miah, who lives opposite Bow Quarter, agreed: \u201cIf terrorists are a threat, this is now the first place they\u2019re going to come. Also, if something attacks us from the sky and they shoot it down, where is it going to land? This is a residential neighborhood, loads of families, loads of kids. It just doesn\u2019t make any sense bringing missile launchers here.\u201d The Ministry of Defence says it chose Bow Quarter because \u201cit is situated close to the Olympic Park and offers an excellent view of the surrounding area, and the entire sky above the Olympic Park.\u201d It says the ground-to-air missile system \u201cis operated by fully trained and experienced soldiers,\u201d and insists \u201cit does not pose any hazard to residents,\u201d adding that the missiles will be guarded 24 hours a day by a team of military personnel and police. For many of those living inside the high walls and security gates, what annoys them most is that no-one asked their opinion. Neil Midgley, Bow Quarter resident and one of the journalists who broke the story of the missiles, told CNN: \u201cIn a Western democracy in 2012, I don\u2019t think the army should occupy private land without consulting the people who live there and getting their consent. \u201cPeople are grown-ups, they understand that the Olympics need to be protected, but there are questions: Do the missiles make us a target? If they are fired, where does the debris fall? And who pays for any damage caused?\u201d Bow Quarter was not always so glamorous and gentrified. The site was once home to the Bryant and May match factory, notorious for the horrific working conditions inside its walls \u2013 until, that is, the mainly female workers rose up and demanded action, and changed British society for good in the process. The \u201cmatch girls\u201d at Bryant and May were paid a pittance \u2013 less than five shillings a week \u2013 and those earnings were frequently whittled away by a system of fines imposed for \u201coffenses\u201d including talking, lateness, talking, and dropping matches. In addition, the dangerous white phosphorous they worked with on a daily basis made them very sick, Louise Raw, historian and author of \u201cStriking a Light: The Bryant and May Matchwomen and their place in Labour history,\u201d told CNN. Many were in poor health because of their work, left bald from carrying heavy boxes on their heads and suffering the horrific industrial disease known as \u201cphossy jaw\u201d \u2013 the necrosis of their jaw bones caused by the white phosphorus used in the matches. \u201cThey were physically very frail,\u201d Raw said.  \u201cThey were working in the factory from the age of 10 or 11 \u2013 sometimes even younger. Their growth was stunted, they were malnourished, and the phosphorus made them really ill.  \u201cIt\u2019s terrible stuff: Back then people used it to commit suicide or to cause abortions, and these women were working with it everyday. It made them really sick. The average life expectancy was just 25.\u201d Disgusted by working conditions at the factory, feminist and social campaigner Annie Besant wrote a crusading article, \u201cWhite Slavery in London\u201d which brought the suffering of the match girls to a wider audience. They were, she wrote: \u201cUndersized because under-fed, oppressed because helpless, flung aside as soon as worked out. Who cares if they die or go on the streets provided only that Bryant & May shareholders get their 23%.\u201d Bryant and May were furious, but when they tried to force the workers to sign a statement insisting they were happy with their treatment, the matchmakers refused, and when one of their number was fired, they walked out. But despite the match girls\u2019 lowly status, the resulting strike garnered the backing of high-profile supporters including playwright George Bernard Shaw, and led to a boycott of the company\u2019s products. \u201cThe match women were the lowest of the low,\u201d said Raw. \u201cThey were a wild and wonderful bunch: factory girls, working class, they were loud and dressed in colorful clothes \u2013 they really had polite Victorian society reaching for the smelling salts. \u201cIn contrast, Bryant and May were big, powerful men, and yet they had to give in to them.\u201d Within weeks, the company reluctantly accepted the strikers\u2019 demands for improved pay and conditions, an end to the system of fines. The match girls went on to found the first union for female workers in Britain, and their actions helped shape the modern Labour movement. That a location of such importance to workers\u2019 rights should be the site of \u201cundemocratic\u201d actions today is not lost on those who live there \u2013 or their supporters. Twitter user Anne McCrossan (@Annemcx) was among those quick to point out the irony: \u201cLaughable that BQ was the site of emancipation in the past, but authoritarian control today, is this the spirit of the games?\u201d Raw said the match women should be an inspiration to those at Bow Quarter who were unhappy at the MoD\u2019s decision. \u201cIt is such Bryant and May-like behaviour to stick missiles on the roof without asking,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cThe match women wouldn\u2019t have stood for it. They were, in theory, completely powerless in the face of authority \u2013 nobody thought they could change anything, but they stood together and they did change things \u2013 they had a huge influence. \u201cIt was a victory for people power, and they are an example to us all.\u201d But Midgley said he doubted that the residents would take action in quite the same way. \u201cI wish I could tell you I think there will be a Bow Quarter uprising, a Bow Quarter Spring over this, but I doubt it.  \u201cIn reality, people are very concerned, and they have questions which will need to be answered. If they are not, then people will try to stop it.\u201d"

        "content": "Agnieszka Radwanska has only lost to one player this season. It\u2019s just that she has now been beaten by Victoria Azarenka an incredible six times. World No. 1 Azarenka maintained her complete dominance over her Polish rival with a 6-2, 6-4 win at the Madrid Masters on Saturday. Azarenka will play former No. 1 Serena Williams in Sunday\u2019s final after the American beat Czech qualifier Lucie Hradecka 7-6 (5), 6-0. Azarenka had already ended Radwanska\u2019s title hopes this year in Sydney, Melbourne, Doha, Indian Wells and Stuttgart. Radwanska has won her other two tournaments and withdrew injured in Kuala Lumpur. Asked if she was looking forward to another chance to go up against Azarenka, the No. 3-ranked Radwanska replied: \u201cYeah sure, maybe in a couple of months!\u201d Australian Open champion Azarenka hammered 29 winners on the infamous blue clay in Madrid as she looks for her fifth title of the year, but she faces a very different task against Williams. Azarenka has a 6-1 losing record against the 13-time Grand Slam champion, although they haven\u2019t met since the Belarussian rose to the top of the world rankings by winning the Australian Open in January. \u201cI have always been competitive against her and she is one of the toughest opponents to play against,\u201d Azarenka said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a different story this time.\u201d Their last meeting ended in a 6-1, 7-6 (5) win for Williams in the U.S. Open third round last year. Williams didn\u2019t face a break point in her semifinal against the big-hitting Hradecka and came through a tight opening set before sweeping through the second in 24 minutes. \u201cShe served amazing in the first set,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI came through in tiebreak, and after that I was able to relax, make less errors and make some shots. I was more aware in the second set. I think that helped me.\u201d The 30-year-old Williams hasn\u2019t lost a clay-court match this season after winning the title in Charleston last month. She will move up to at least No. 6 in the world rankings on Monday. \u201cI have been working really hard but I don\u2019t want to stop at No. 6 and I want to continue to do better,\u201d Williams said. \u201cVictoria obviously has been playing this whole year so consistent, so amazing and just nearly perfect so I am going into the final with nothing to lose. \u201cShe\u2019s the top-ranked player and she\u2019s going in there with everything to win.\u201d"

        "content": "It was another bad day at the office for Tiger Woods as he shot a two-over-par 74 in his opening round at the Players Championship Thursday. The US PGA event, often referred to as the \u201cfifth major,\u201d is worth a cool $9.5 million but Woods is unlikely to taste any of that bounty having already fallen nine shots off leaders Ian Poulter and Martin Laird. World number seven Woods, a 14-time major champion who still dreams of breaking Jack Nicklaus\u2019 record of 18, endured a torrid time as he seeks to return to the consistency that made him virtually unbeatable a few years back. The 36-year-old broke a 17-month drought in March with victory at Bay Hill but came to TPC Sawgrass \u2013 where his only win was back in 2001 \u2013 in poor form having missed the cut at Quail Hollow, only the eighth time that has happened in his career. Tiger Woods hits back at his critics But after another bad opening round Woods may well miss the cut again. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t certainly the most positive start,\u201d Woods told reporters.  \u201cAny kind of momentum that I would build, I would shoot myself in the foot on the very next hole. Just one of those days. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a lot out of that round. I just didn\u2019t score. I hit decent shots in there and just got some of the worst lies.\u201d Players Championship leaderboard Woods had claimed before Quail Hollow that he had put his problem swing behind him and was slowly building back towards something approaching his best. \u201cJust be patient with it. Just keep plugging along,\u201d he said.  \u201cIn the last few months, I\u2019ve put together some good rounds, won a couple tournaments, so it\u2019s there. I just need to continue doing it.\u201d Meanwhile the man who was once lambasted for suggesting \u2013 while Woods was at the peak of his powers and seemingly untouchable \u2013 that he could one day challenge golf\u2019s most enigmatic player is leading the tournament. Poulter shot a magnificent seven-under 65, dropping just one shot the entire round.  \u201cIt felt real solid,\u201d the Englishman told the PGA\u2019s official website. \u201cI got off to a nice start, hit a few good shots early on \u2026  then four birdies in a row from nine.\u201d And the secret of Poulter\u2019s round? According to the Englishman it was to play less golf.  \u201cI\u2019ve been busy at home, new house to move in to, stuff to occupy my mind,\u201d he explained.  \u201cAnd when I haven\u2019t been (moving house), I\u2019ve been hitting some balls \u2026 My time on the range has been a small but concentrated effort.\u201d Poulter was joined at the top by Scotland\u2019s Martin Laird, who also birdied the notoriously difficult \u201cisland\u201d par-three 17th hole \u2013 which cost two-time major champion Angel Cabrera nine shots on Thursday. Laird,, a two-time winner on the PGA Tour whose last victory came at Bay Hill in 2011, completed a flawless round to be one shot clear of American Blake Adams. Compatriots Kevin Na and Ben Crane both finished with five-under 67s, while Matt Kuchar, Bill Haas, Ben Curtis and Australia\u2019s Adam Scott were in a group of 11 players on 68.  "

        "content": "Greece may have given us the word democracy and many of the principles of civil society. But now it is \u201cthe sick man of Europe,\u201d and the people of other European democracies are asking whether it\u2019s worth saving with billions more dollars of their money. Put crudely, their argument is this: So what if Greece slides ignominiously out of the eurozone?    Goodbye Greece\u2026 In continental terms, Greece is peripheral. It doesn\u2019t sit on reservoirs of oil, and it relies on agriculture and tourism as money-earners. It accounts for just 5% of the European Union\u2019s economic output. With the Cold War long over, its strategic position on the edge of the Balkans is not as important as it was.  Second, critics question whether Greece has the will or capacity to stay within the eurozone. In last Sunday\u2019s elections, the main Greek parties \u2013 those that had promised to swallow the medicine doled out by the European Union and International Monetary Fund  \u2013 were trounced at the polls. Thursday, a third political leader was invited to try to form a government. Greek commentators predict no stable coalition is likely \u2013 and new elections probable, just as a further $15 billion of austerity measures are due.  Two weeks ago, the governor of Greece\u2019s Central Bank, George Provopoulos, warned that unless the country stayed the course, there could be \u201ca disorderly regression, taking the country back several decades and eventually driving it out of the euro area and the European Union.\u201d  A majority of Greek \u2013 some 70% \u2013 tell pollsters they want the country to remain in the eurozone. But a substantial minority have just voted for parties that oppose what they see as austerity imposed by Berlin. They believe the medicine is actually making the situation worse. This year, the Central Bank forecasts the economy will shrink by 5%, after a 7% contraction last year. That means fewer jobs, less tax revenue and more difficulty meeting debt obligations.  Third, is the endless bailout smart economics?  Or does it just perpetuate the crisis, as new debt replaces old? A confidential analysis by the IMF, European Central Bank and European Commission in February projected that Greek debt would still amount to 129% of GDP in 2020 and could be as high as 160%. The analysis, obtained by Reuters in February, estimated Greece would need some $175 billion in financing over the next two years. Some argue that so long as Greece uses the euro as its currency, it will never become competitive. Research by investment bank Goldman Sachs concluded Greece needed a real depreciation in its exchange rate of a whopping 30% to restore competitiveness. Compare its situation to that of Iceland, which after a financial meltdown in 2008 thanks to its over-stretched banking sector, went cold turkey with a 40% devaluation of its currency and let bank creditors whistle in the wind. Now it\u2019s started growing again, albeit modestly. U.S. economist Kenneth Rogoff has argued that Athens should be granted a sabbatical from the eurozone while remaining in the European Union, allowing it reintroduce the drachma at a deep discount to the euro and making its tourism industry wildly popular.  Hans-Werner Sim, head of German think tank Ifo, agrees. The money being showered on Greece to keep it in the eurozone would be better spent lubricating its departure, he says. \u201cThe drachma will immediately depreciate, and the situation will stabilize very quickly. After a short thunderstorm, the sun will shine again,\u201d he told German magazine der Spiegel. Fourth, beyond the discouraging arithmetic, some argue that the Greek state is too dysfunctional to cope with its massive obligations. Greece has a tax system that barely works, recalcitrant labor unions and extensive graft. The latest corruption league table from Transparency International ranks Greece as 80th - along with El Salvador.    \u201cFor decades the political elite, mired in corruption and rent-seeking, has followed the path of wasteful spending and patronage,\u201d wrote Kostas Bakoyannis, the mayor of Karpenisi, in the Wall Street Journal last month. Greece hasn\u2019t privatized a single, state-owned industry despite repeated promises to do so. Its social fabric is fraying and it has a growing problem with political violence. Add to that, now, an unstable political order. And finally, if Greece is unable to get its house in order and uncertainty persists, the dreaded contagion effect will rear its head again.  It\u2019s a truism that markets hate uncertainty, and for the last year Greece has delivered it in weekly installments.  The never-ending melodrama could worsen the psychological climate for other \u201colive-belt\u201d members of the eurozone. Negotiations on restructuring Greek sovereign debt have already left international investors wary of buying other south European debt. According to the Financial Times last month, investors have withdrawn $130 billion from Europe\u2019s sovereign bond markets over the past two years. On the other hand\u2026 The opposing argument is that a \u201cdisorderly default\u201d or even a managed exit by Greece would have far-reaching consequences for Europe \u2013 none of them good \u2013 and misreads the Greek mood. Pierpaolo Barbieri, Ernest May Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Belfer Center, has written extensively about Europe\u2019s financial crisis. \u201cGreek voters have turned against the old duopoly of PASOK and New Democracy,\u201d he says, referring to the dominant parties of the past 30 years. \u201cThey are tired of crisis. That doesn\u2019t mean they are against being part of the eurozone. They realize their savings would be wiped out if a devalued drachma took the place of the euro and that Greek banks would collapse. So it\u2019s important to separate the weakness of the existing political parties from the issue of the bailouts and the eurozone.\u201d Second, there is no playbook for leaving the single currency, no rules governing expulsion. It was just never envisaged. A new Greek government, by persistently defaulting on debt repayments, might effectively vote itself out of the eurozone, but the process would be messy. Greek companies that take advantage of the single market would be badly affected. \u201cAny announcement of Greece\u2019s departure would wreck havoc in the markets. If Greeks elected someone who wanted to pursue this path, it would be impossible to get back in at a later date,\u201d Barbieri told CNN. In addition, he says, there is no guarantee that excising Greece from the eurozone will relieve pressure on other members. It might simply refocus anxiety on the next most vulnerable state.  \u201cIf Greece were to fall out, what would that say to Portugal, Italy, Spain and Ireland? There would be a danger to the whole European construction, including the single market. The Germans often say \u201cIf the euro fails then Europe fails\u201d \u2013 and project Europe has been at the core of German foreign policy for half a century.\u201d Italy, Spain and Portugal are in the middle of painful restructuring; just this week the Spanish government announced it would have to step in to rescue the country\u2019s third largest bank. The worst-case scenario: that the whole concept of an \u201cever-closer union\u201d toward which Europe has been striving will unwind, one state at a time.   \u201cEurope will have difficulty forming a federation, if its first action is to jettison countries that are unable to make ends meet,\u201d wrote commentator Barbara Spinelli in the Italian newspaper la Repubblica.  Let them eat carrots Is there a way to muddle through? Maybe. But it will require a tilt from \u201causterity\u201d toward \u201cgrowth\u201d to persuade the Greeks that their suffering will not be endless. The basic choice may remain bailout or bankruptcy, but the bailout can be sweetened, as a spokesman for EU Economics Commissioner Olli Rehn hinted Tuesday.  \u201cWe can do lots to assist Greece, and we are doing so. Our member states, our taxpayers in other European member states of the euro area, are providing this solidarity,\u201d he said.  Concrete action must follow, says Barbieri.  \u201cEurope needs to show the Greeks that they have reason to hope by staying the course, that it won\u2019t just be pain and more pain. There have to be measures to help growth, such as European investment projects in infrastructure and help for small and medium businesses starved for funding, which can be achieved through the European Investment Bank. The ECB should continue to help Greek banks, so as to start lending again.\u201d  Next year, Angela Merkel will be seeking a third term as German chancellor. If she gets one, analysts say, she may have greater freedom to tilt toward growth.  \u201cIt would be a positive development if Francois Hollande [the newly elected French President] could hasten this development and create \u2018rewards\u2019 for reforming countries, so as to remind European electorates the monetary union is not a \u2018suicide pact,\u2019 says Barbieri.  It may be that even with a rancorous political atmosphere, mass unemployment and street protests, Greece is actually making progress. If (yes, it\u2019s a large if) the next round of public spending cuts goes through Greece get close to achieving what\u2019s called a primary balance, its revenue will pay for its spending. According to the Central Bank, the economy may finally stop shrinking in 2013. But 2013 seems a long way off, and these are the first tentative steps toward convalescence. Anyone who has seen the movie \u201cMonty Python and the Holy Grail\u201d will recall what happened to the man who insisted he wasn\u2019t dead yet."

        "content": "Lionel Messi has been dragged into the row about racism in football, but his club Barcelona insists that accusations against the three-time world player of the year are \u201cwell wide of the mark.\u201d Messi is said to have frequently directed a racial term at Real Madrid\u2019s Royston Drenthe during matches in the Spanish top flight. Drenthe, who has spent this season on loan at English Premier League club Everton, claimed in an interview with a Dutch magazine that Messi repeatedly called him \u201cnegro\u201d (meaning black). It is the same word that caused huge controversy in English football this season when Manchester United\u2019s black defender Patrice Evra accused Liverpool striker Luis Suarez of using the term several times during a Premier League match between the teams. Suarez was banned for eight matches and fined \u00a340,000 ($64,330). He maintained that the word \u201cnegro\u201d is used commonly in his native Uruguay and is not a form of racial abuse. But Barcelona strongly rejected any suggestion that Argentine forward Messi would have used the same term. \u201cThe player has always shown a maximum respect and sportsmanship towards his rivals, something which has been recognized by his fellow professionals many times, and we are sure that any accusations to the contrary are well wide of the mark,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cHis behavior throughout his career has always been exemplary.\u201d Messi has had another outstanding season individually, scoring an unprecedented 72 goals in all competitions and a record 50 in La Liga alone ahead of Saturday\u2019s final match at Real Betis. However, his team have fallen short of their usual high standards, losing out in the Spanish title race to Real Madrid and suffering a shock loss to Chelsea in the Champions League semifinals when Messi hit the bar with a crucial penalty in the second leg. Drenthe\u2019s spell at Everton has ended miserably. The 25-year-old hasn\u2019t been picked since he was dropped from the FA Cup semifinal against Liverpool on April 14 for unspecified disciplinary reasons. The Dutch midfielder joined Real Madrid for a reported \u20ac14 million ($18.1 million) in 2007 but has spent the last two seasons out on loan. He has been quoted as saying he wants to return to Feyenoord, where he played before joining Madrid."

        "content": "Rebekah Brooks was once feted as one of the rising stars of the British media: She was the youngest person ever to edit a national British newspaper, and made a stellar rise through the ranks of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire. She held the top job at News International, News Corp.\u2019s British subsidiary, for two years after editing the country\u2019s best-selling daily tabloid, The Sun, and its best-selling Sunday tabloid, News of the World. But following allegations of illegal eavesdropping by News of the World journalists when she was editor, she saw her fortunes fade. Brooks resigned as chief executive of News International in July 2011 amid public outrage over hacking allegations and was summoned by police the following week. It was the first time she was arrested and questioned by police investigating phone hacking claims.  Brooks kept a low profile after her resignation but was ridiculed in the British press when it was revealed that London\u2019s Metropolitan Police had lent her a retired police horse in 2008.  As politicians became engulfed in the scandal, with allegations that ministers acted improperly in their dealings with News Corp., Prime Minister David Cameron \u2013 a family friend of Brooks\u2019 husband \u2013 admitted he had ridden the horse.   When Brooks appeared before the Leveson Inquiry into press standards in 2012, she was grilled about her relationship with Britain\u2019s current and former prime ministers and detailed her frequent contacts with Cameron in the run-up to the 2010 election.  In October 2013, Brooks was among seven people to go on trial for phone hacking. She denied all charges of conspiracy \u201cto intercept communications in the course of their transmission, without lawful authority,\u201d conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and conspiracy to obstruct a police investigation. On June 23, jurors found her not guilty of the charges, the UK\u2019s Press Association news agency reported. Before she took the stand in February 2014, the defense reminded the jury that Brooks was not on trial \u201cbecause she was the editor of a tabloid newspaper\u201d or for working for media baron Rupert Murdoch or for \u201cany political views she may hold\u201d or for \u201cthe support newspapers she edited gave to one party or another.\u201d Rather, the defense said, her trial hinged on whether she knew about and endorsed a \u201cpractice of phone hacking at News of the World during her editorship\u201d; whether she had encouraged a Sun reporter to pay a public official; and whether she had asked her husband, Charlie Brooks, and her personal assistant, Cheryl Carter, to \u201cget rid of things \u2026 to cover up the practice of phone hacking or of paying public officials.\u201d  Brooks denied any wrongdoing. Asked by her lawyer if she was ever asked to sanction the practice of phone hacking while editor of News of the World, from 2000 to 2003, Brooks said: \u201cNo.\u201d During the trial, prosecutors alleged that Brooks had a clandestine affair with co-accused Andy Coulson from 1998-2004, which they argued showed the pair\u2019s level of trust.  Giving evidence, Brooks described her personal life as a \u201ccar crash for many years,\u201d the Guardian newspaper reported.  She denied there had been a long-standing affair but acknowledged there had been periods of physical intimacy.  Coulson edited the News of the World from 2003 until 2007, having served as Brooks\u2019 deputy at the tabloid for three years before that. He went on to be David Cameron\u2019s director of communications, resigning from his role with the prime minister in 2011, when police launched a second investigation into newspaper eavesdropping. When Coulson gave evidence in April - with his wife watching from the public gallery - he said the affair \u201cshouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d the BBC and Guardian newspaper reported. But he denied that it meant he and Brooks had shared sensitive stories, the outlets said.  The revelations were seized on by UK media covering the case, with one newspaper - The Independent \u2013 headlining its story \u201cThe affair they didn\u2019t expose,\u201d a reference to the tabloid newspapers\u2019 history of revealing other people\u2019s cheating. In June, Coulson was found guilty of conspiracy to hack phones.   Hard lessons learned Brought up in Cheshire, northern England, in the 1970s, Brooks is said to have decided on a career in journalism at the age of 14, beginning with a job as a \u201ctea girl\u201d at her local paper. In her late teens, she moved to Paris, where she is reported to have worked at architectural magazine L\u2019Architecture d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui and studied at the Sorbonne. On her return to the UK, she worked in regional papers before making the move to Sunday tabloid News of the World in the late 1980s. Starting out as a secretary, Rebekah Wade \u2013 her maiden name \u2013 swiftly made her way up the editorial food chain, becoming deputy editor by the age of 27. She tells of how, at a corporate golf day shortly after she was appointed, one senior executive ordered her to sew the buttons back on his shirt. Her response is not known. Sexism in the workplace aside, Brooks\u2019 rise through the ranks continued. She was named deputy editor of the hugely popular Sun newspaper, the News of the World\u2019s sister title, in 1998. In 2000, she returned to the News of the World, this time in the top job, becoming the youngest-ever editor of a national British paper. While editor of the weekly, Brooks argued for the creation of a U.S.-style \u201cSarah\u2019s Law,\u201d which would allow parents with young children to know about anyone convicted of child sex crimes living close to their homes. As part of the controversial campaign, which was inspired by the murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne in July 2000, Brooks took the decision to name and shame offenders in the pages of her paper. The lists sparked witch-hunts and riots, as communities across Britain tried to hound pedophiles out of their neighborhoods. It was condemned by police, but Brooks remains unrepentant. In a 2009 speech, she admitted the campaign was \u201ca blunt and contentious way of informing the public \u2026 hard lessons were learned but I don\u2019t regret the campaign for one minute.\u201d She married soap star Ross Kemp, famous for his hard-man role as Grant Mitchell in long-running British TV show \u201cEastenders.\u201d In 2003, she was promoted again, becoming editor of the Sun, a post she held until 2009 when she was handpicked for the role of News International chief executive by Rupert Murdoch.  In the same year Brooks and Kemp divorced and she remarried horse trainer Charlie Brooks. The couple\u2019s wedding party was attended by a host of big names, including the Murdoch clan (Rupert, James and Elisabeth), the then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and future-Prime Minister David Cameron. Brooks and Murdoch had been close for many years: before her downfall Rupert Murdoch was said to have treated Brooks like a daughter. Whether the relationship has survived the scandal remains unclear."

Authorities arrested three men this week in Georgia\u2019s breakaway republic of Abkhazia on charges of plotting the attack in a joint operation with Abkhazian security services, the Russian National Anti-Terrorism Committee said, according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. The three are suspected of being ringleaders of a regional cell of the North Caucasus-based terrorist group Caucasus Emirate.  Police seized weapons, including three portable surface-to-air missiles, two anti-tank guided missiles, a mortar and a flamethrower, the news agency said. The militants planned to move the arms to the nearby resort city of Sochi and use them to carry out terrorist attacks during the Games, it quoted the National Anti-Terrorism Committee as saying.  The U.S. State Department added the Caucasus Emirate, a Chechen group based in the North Caucasus, to its list of foreign terrorist groups, and has authorized a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the location of its leader, Doku Umarov. The State Department said Umarov organized a suicide bombing outside the Chechen Interior Ministry in May 2009.  His group also claimed responsibility for last year\u2019s bombing of Domodedovo Airport in Moscow that killed 36 people, the 2010 bombings of the Moscow subway that killed 40 and the 2009 bombing of the high-speed Nevsky Express train in which 28 people died."

        "content": "A former Rupert Murdoch newspaper editor who became a spokesman for British Prime Minister David Cameron told a probe into British press ethics that he did not know about phone hacking while he was editor. Andy Coulson was quizzed Thursday over the News of the World\u2019s relationships with politicians, as well as his role as Cameron\u2019s communications chief, in two-and-a-half hours of questioning before the independent, government-appointed panel. The Leveson Inquiry was set up in response to accusations of widespread phone hacking by journalists working for the News of the World, which was edited by Coulson from 2003 until his resignation in 2007. Critics have questioned Cameron\u2019s judgment in hiring Coulson after he quit the paper. Coulson resigned as Cameron\u2019s spokesman in January 2011 when police opened a new investigation into the scandal. He insisted he was innocent but said he had become a distraction for the government. Questioned Thursday, Coulson said the jailing of two News of the World employees over phone hacking in 2007 did come up in discussions with senior party members before he was offered the job. He told the inquiry he had told them and Cameron what he has said repeatedly \u2013 that he knew nothing about the practice of hacking under his leadership of the paper. He also denied he was taken on because of his links to News International, the British arm of News Corp., which runs the UK\u2019s biggest selling daily tabloid, The Sun. Coulson said he had told Cameron and then-shadow chancellor George Osborne that his connections would not guarantee the backing of Murdoch\u2019s papers, and that they should reach out to a wide range of news outlets. The Sun switched its allegiance from the Labour Party to Cameron\u2019s Conservatives ahead of the 2010 election, which resulted in the formation of a Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. Coulson said he never witnessed a conversation that was \u201cinappropriate\u201d between members of the government and News International. He also denied direct involvement in discussions of News Corp.\u2019s bid fully to take over British satellite broadcaster BSkyB, and dismissed as a conspiracy theory the suggestion that some kind of deal had been struck by the Conservatives on that takeover in return for Murdoch\u2019s support. Asked later however whether politicians and the press were too close, Coulson said he was \u201cnot minded to disagree\u201d with the assessment of Cameron that relations were \u201ctoo cozy.\u201d Coulson said he had continued to hold \u00a340,000 ($64,000) of shares in News Corp. while working for Cameron in opposition and in government, but had not considered it a conflict of interest. He had not paid much attention to his financial affairs, he said, because his job kept him very busy.  Quizzed about his relationship with Murdoch, chairman of News Corp., Coulson said the media baron would often call on a Saturday night, shortly before the newspaper\u2019s publication Sunday. \u201cWe discussed politics generally. He would give me his views on whatever was in the news at the time,\u201d Coulson said. Coulson said Murdoch was supportive of him as an editor. \u201cI was an employee, and I thoroughly enjoyed my time working for him. In the interactions I had with him, he was warm and supportive,\u201d Coulson said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t particularly close to him, I wouldn\u2019t want to overstate it.\u201d Coulson said the newspaper tended to reflect the public mood on politics rather than try to lead it, except on certain issues. The decision to support Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair in the 2005 election was taken with the News of the World\u2019s editorial team, he said. However, he did not recall discussing the paper\u2019s support for the Labour Party with Murdoch. \u201cI was determined we would spend a reasonable amount of time with politicians from both parties and make up our own minds,\u201d Coulson said. The paper\u2019s coverage of the Conservative Party leadership contest, which resulted in Cameron becoming party leader, was not skewed in favor of any of the candidates, Coulson said. Asked if the News of World\u2019s coverage of the Conservative Party grew more favorable after Cameron became leader, Coulson pointed out that the paper had run stories that did not help the party. He resigned as editor when one of the paper\u2019s journalists and a private investigator were sent to prison for phone hacking in 2007, although he denied knowing about the illegal eavesdropping.  Six months later, he was hired to work for Cameron as his director of communications. Coulson said the progression from the media world to politics was not unusual. Questions have been raised in the UK media about the level of security vetting Coulson underwent. He told the inquiry he had seen some classified documents and occasionally attended security briefings. The phone hacking scandal has reverberated throughout the top levels of British politics and journalism, and led a parliamentary committee to issue damning criticism of global media baron Murdoch. Dozens of people, including Coulson, have been arrested in connection with the scandal, although no one has been charged. He is free on bail. Another former News of the World editor, Rebekah Brooks, is set to appear before the inquiry Friday. Brooks resigned last summer as chief executive of News of the World\u2019s publisher, News International, a subsidiary of News Corp., amid outrage over claims of widespread hacking by the Sunday tabloid\u2019s staff.  She was editor of News of the World in 2002 when the newspaper hacked the voice mail of a missing schoolgirl, Milly Dowler. The teenager was later found dead.  Brooks has been arrested twice and released on bail in connection with police investigations into the scandal. Coulson acknowledged that Cameron was particularly interested in gaining the backing of The Sun, the biggest-selling daily tabloid and another of Murdoch\u2019s UK newspapers. But he denied having encouraged Cameron to become friends with Brooks, who was The Sun\u2019s editor from 2003 to 2009. Coulson said there was a long-standing family connection between Cameron and her husband, racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks, and the couple lived near the Conservative lawmaker\u2019s constituency home. Rebekah and Charlie Brooks have socialized with Cameron. Rebekah Brooks is also known for close ties to Murdoch. Last month, the Leveson Inquiry grilled the media magnate and his son, James Murdoch, also a senior News Corp. executive.  Rupert Murdoch faced stinging criticism last week when a UK parliamentary committee examining phone hacking at the News of the World said he was \u201cnot a fit person\u201d to run a major international company. However, News Corp.\u2019s board of directors strongly endorsed him Wednesday, expressing \u201cfull confidence in Rupert Murdoch\u2019s fitness\u201d and supporting his leadership of the company.  Murdoch\u2019s News Corp. encompasses Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post, and Harper Collins publishers in the United States. News International \u2013 a British subsidiary of News Corp. \u2013 owns The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times in Britain."

        "content": "The leader of the socialist PASOK party in Greece is starting efforts to build a government, his party said, making him the third Greek politician since Sunday to try to do so. PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos held meetings with the leader of the Democratic Left party, Fotis Kouvelis, in what Venizelos called a \u201cfirst step\u201d toward assembling a coalition of pro-European parties. He is scheduled to hold talks with head of the center-right New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, on Friday.  Samaras and another potential coalition partner \u2013 Alexis Tsipras of the leftist Syriza party \u2013 have tried and failed to organize a government already. If no one can pull together a coalition, and no national unity government can be formed by May 17, Greece must call new elections.  Venizelos, who has three days to cobble together a deal, said Sunday\u2019s fragmented results show voters don\u2019t trust \u201cany party on its own.\u201d But he says he wants Greece to stay in the eurozone, the group of 17 European countries that use a common currency. \u201cIt is a given that we want Greece in the euro,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want something better, not something worse.\u201d Read why Greece will muddle through crisis Greece has been forced to impose punishing austerity measures to get international loans that have kept it from defaulting on debts. The election results were widely seen as a message to politicians to back away from the harsh economic austerity measures. Voters backed parties on the far left and right, withholding support from PASOK and New Democracy, the more moderate parties that made up the coalition that enacted the cuts. Seven parties won seats in parliament in Sunday\u2019s election, but no party captured more than 19% of the vote.   As Tsipras began coalition talks Tuesday, he said PASOK and New Democracy \u201cdon\u2019t have a majority any more to vote for the plundering of the Greek people.\u201d PASOK placed third in the election, behind New Democracy and Syriza. The latest opinion poll, by Marc-Alpha TV, suggests that if new elections are held, Syriza would come out on top, with nearly 24% of the vote, followed by New Democracy with 17.4% and PASOK with just under 11%. A coalition would still need to be formed. Extreme-right party Golden Dawn would take a smaller share of a second vote than on Sunday, the poll suggests, but would still pass the threshold to have lawmakers in parliament.  A European Commission spokeswoman said this week that Greece needs time to work through its political process, but she reminded the country\u2019s leaders that they would be expected to abide by the terms of a bailout program meant to avoid a crippling financial meltdown. \u201cThe commission hopes and expects that the future government of Greece will respect the engagements that Greece has entered into,\u201d spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen told reporters. New Democracy ended up with 108 seats in Greece\u2019s 300-seat parliament. Voters also delivered a rebuke to PASOK, leaving it with 41 of the 160 seats it held before Sunday\u2019s vote. Together, the parties fell short of the 50% necessary to continue their coalition, requiring formation of a new government. Last year, Greece\u2019s debt threatened to force it to drop Europe\u2019s common currency, the euro, prompting the European Central Bank and other lenders to swoop in with emergency funding. In exchange, they demanded that the government slash spending. The resulting measures have led to tax increases and cuts in jobs, wages, pensions and benefits \u2013 and significant public outcry. Read why Greece shouldn\u2019t be allowed to sink The national unemployment rate for January, the latest month for which figures are available, was nearly 22%, prompting widespread protests and leading some young people to leave the country in search of work.  Youth unemployment is even higher than the national average of one in five out of work. For two years, the country\u2019s massive amount of debt has threatened the stability of the eurozone. Greece pushed through a huge debt swap in March to save it from disorderly default and clear the way for it to receive a second bailout from the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, worth \u20ac130 billion ($171.5 billion). The debt restructuring deal gave some breathing space to the eurozone bloc, where fears that Greece might collapse had increased pressure on other debt-laden nations such as Spain and Italy."

Now the country is back in the headlines, thanks to the controversial detention of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, a heroine of the revolution, and threats to boycott next month\u2019s Euro 2012 soccer matches in response. Viktor Yanukovych, the man defeated in 2004 by rival Viktor Yushchenko, is now president and stands accused by critics of persecuting his political opponents, Tymoshenko among them. And the promise of the 2004 Orange Revolution, where millions joined in peaceful protest against alleged corruption and in defense of democracy, is judged to have turned sour. So what happened? And where will Ukraine, a country of some 46 million people sandwiched between Russia and Eastern Europe, go next? Key to Ukraine\u2019s future are its troubled relationships with Russia and Europe \u2013 and the vexed question of its natural gas supply. And with parliamentary elections due this October, the pressure is on Yanukovych to do what it takes to keep his Party of Regions in power. Analysts agree that the seeds of Ukraine\u2019s current political disarray were sown soon after the pro-Western Orange Revolution swept Yushchenko and the glamorous Tymoshenko, famous for her blond braid, into power. \u201cThe Orange Revolution progressed Ukraine along the path of free elections and media pluralism,\u201d said Dr. Taras Kuzio, senior fellow for the Washington-based Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Relations.  \u201cIt never really got to grips with the two more fundamental issues of rule of law and corruption.\u201d  Yushchenko failed to deal with Soviet-style corruption in the judiciary, prosecutor\u2019s office and security services, said Kuzio, and \u201cthese institutions are now being used by counterrevolutionaries to basically take their revenge.\u201d Tymoshenko even more of a threat in defeat The president and his prime minister, Tymoshenko, also failed to live up to their promises while in power.  \u201cThe Orange Revolution was an unvarnished disappointment because they fell to squabbling and settling old scores almost as soon as they got into power, and the personality politics wrecked the whole government,\u201d said Nicholas Redman, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \u201cThe vote for Yanukovych was a clear sign of the disappointment of unfulfilled promises from the Orange Revolution.\u201d When Yanukovych beat Tymoshenko in the 2010 presidential contest, he and his supporters believed it was justice after the 2004 election was, in their eyes, stolen from them, Kuzio said. But he won by a margin of only 3%, making the self-confident blonde, known for her fiery speeches, appear even more of a threat than before \u2013 and Yanukovych more determined to consolidate power, Kuzio said. Last October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with Russia in 2009. More criminal charges, including murder, are in the works and cases have also been filed against other opposition politicians. Many see Tymoshenko\u2019s imprisonment as motivated by political revenge and a desire to put the country\u2019s leading opposition figure out of the picture. The Ukrainian government denies that is the case, saying justice has been served. But her incarceration, followed by her decision to go on hunger strike to protest her medical care and an alleged beating in prison, have exposed how far the country still has to go to live up to Western expectations on justice and human rights. When German Chancellor Angela Merkel threatened to boycott the Euro 2012 matches to be played in Ukraine \u2013 some in Kharkiv, where Tymoshenko is jailed \u2013 in protest at her treatment, other European figures quickly followed suit. In another big embarrassment for Yanukovych, a summit of Central European leaders set to take place this month in Yalta, southern Ukraine, was called off after 13 of the 20 invited leaders threatened to boycott it, Kuzio said. And a so-called Association Agreement with the European Union \u2013 which if signed would bring closer ties and economic benefits to Ukraine \u2013 has been put on hold for as long as Tymoshenko remains in prison. A high-stakes balancing act for the president All this leads to the question of what Yanukovych does next. The president is in a difficult position because any admission that Tymoshenko was jailed last October on trumped-up charges will threaten his own grip on power, Redman said. If he cannot turn to Europe, Yanukovych must look instead to Russia as an ally, unless he wants Ukraine to wither in isolation. But although commonly described as pro-Moscow, Yanukovych is better considered as first of all pro-Ukraine, analysts say, and ties to Moscow are fraught with their own risks to his homeland. At the heart of Ukraine\u2019s relationship with Russia are its former status as part of the Soviet Union and the reliance of its industrial sector on Russia\u2019s vast reserves of natural gas, said Dr. Igor Sutyagin, a research fellow in Russian studies at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank. People in Ukraine, which became independent in 1991, want to feel separate from Russia and dislike the perception that they are in Moscow\u2019s pocket, Sutyagin said. But leaders in the Kremlin are keen to keep Ukraine within Russia\u2019s sphere of influence \u2013 and one way to keep it in line is through the control of natural gas supplies, a perennial source of conflict between the two countries.  Much of the natural gas supply of Eastern Europe flows through Ukrainian-owned pipelines from Russia\u2019s Gazprom, leading to fury in Europe in 2006 and 2009 when Moscow shut off supplies in the height of winter during contract battles with Ukraine. At the time the gas deal was signed by Tymoshenko and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin in 2009, tensions between all parties were high and a resolution to the crisis was urgently needed. With hindsight, Tymoshenko did not strike a great deal for Ukraine, analysts say, but that is partly to do with market fluctuations, and they consider it should be seen as a political error, not a criminal offense. Nonetheless, the price had steadily climbed by the time Yanukovych was elected and the country\u2019s industry was feeling the pain. \u2018Big brother\u2019 mentality still reigns in Russia In Ukraine, business and politics are closely intertwined, said Sutyagin, and Yanukovych\u2019s political support base is in the energy-hungry industrial east of the country, which tends to look more to Russia and where its fertilizer and aluminum businesses are centered. Soon after taking office, Yanukovych signed a treaty with Moscow that extended its right to use Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea ports for an additional 25 years, until 2042, in return for a renegotiated deal on natural gas imports that knocked $100 per thousand cubic meters off the price. The ports, on the Crimean Peninsula, are strategically useful to Russia\u2019s navy but more importantly hold symbolic significance for the Kremlin, which sets great store in military power, said Sutyagin. \u201cIt\u2019s still very difficult for the Russian ruling elite to recognize that Ukraine is finally independent,\u201d Sutyagin added, and Moscow still tries to take a \u201cbig brother\u201d role toward its neighbor. Russia is also pressing Ukraine to join a \u201ccustoms union,\u201d involving Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, rather than pursue closer links with Europe. But in the longer term, Ukraine is playing a hand of diminishing strength in international terms, said Redman. Although Kiev is seeking to exploit recently discovered shale gas reserves in a bid to lessen its dependence on Russia, Moscow is investing in alternative transit routes for its oil and gas to reach Europe. That would mean Ukraine no longer has the bargaining chip of its gas pipeline to use in negotiations with its powerful neighbor. Meanwhile, the controversy over Tymoshenko\u2019s alleged abuse in prison, with images of her bruised body seen around the world, has given opponents of greater Ukrainian integration within Europe plenty of ammunition, said Redman. \u201cYanukovych\u2019s desire to consolidate his grip on power and to ensure that power does not transfer back to anyone else \u2013 that Tymoshenko doesn\u2019t get a second bite of the cherry \u2013 has in effect closed off the Western option, but he refuses to see it,\u201d Redman said. In domestic terms, Yanukovych\u2019s rolling back of democracy since gaining power and the incarceration of Tymoshenko has boosted popular support for her and her party, Kuzio said. This could lead to pain at the polls for Yanukovych in October \u2013 if free elections are held \u2013 and make a humiliating boycott of the Euro 2012 tournament in Ukraine just the start of the president\u2019s woes."

        "content": "Atletico Madrid beat Athletic Bilbao 3-0 in Wednesday\u2019s all-Spanish final of the Europa League in the Romanian capital Bucharest, thanks to two stunning first-half goals from Radamel Falcao. The Colombia striker was top scorer in Europe\u2019s second-tier club competition last season as he helped Porto take the title, netting the only goal of an all-Portuguese final, and he has had a similar impact this time. He came close to scoring a hat-trick when he hit the post, before Brazilian midfielder Diego scored a late goal on the breakaway.  While the build-up to the match focused on both clubs coming from the same league, that tells only half the story \u2013 their philosophies, history, catchment area and even language are a country apart. Athletic is a Basque team to its marrow, based in the northern city and made up exclusively of talent nurtured in its youth academy or from players who can trace their ancestry to the Basque country.  The region has long walked a different beat to the rest of Spain, having a distinct language, culture and history. The terrorist group ETA has taken hundreds of lives fighting for Basque independence.  But in that context, Bilbao\u2019s Argentine coach comes from a different planet. Marcelo Bielsa is arguably the most innovative coach in world football. Known for his intellect, temper and idiosyncratic behavior on the sidelines and on the training pitch \u2013 which has earned him the nickname \u201cEl Loco\u201d \u2013 Bielsa has had to rely on tactically out-thinking his opponents rather than outspending them. The highlight of the campaign came in an earlier round when Bielsa\u2019s team ripped English champions Manchester United apart over two matches. For the final \u201cEl Loco\u201d was up against Diego Simeone, who played for Bielsa when he was in charge of the Argentina national team. But it was Bielsa\u2019s young protege who came out on top as Atletico Madrid won the title for the second time in three years, largely thanks to the performance of Falcao \u2013 who scored a record 17 goals in 14 games in last season\u2019s competition.  His two goals gave Madrid a decisive advantage, curling home a left-foot effort and then executing a wonderful drag-back to leave his defensive opponent on the turf before lashing the ball into the net.  \u201cFalcao forgot what he did last year and because of that he could live the moment he did today,\u201d Simeone, who was appointed coach in December, told reporters after the match. \u201cI\u2019ve known Radamel since he was a boy \u2013 I had him at River (Plate in 2008), we won a league together. I love him as a person and admire him. There\u2019s no ceiling to his ambition.\u201d In the second half, Bilbao besieged Madrid\u2019s goal without having many clear cut opportunities. Instead Madrid waited and broke on the counter attack, scoring a third and effectively ending the contest with five minutes to go.       By then even the usually boisterous \u201cEl Loco\u201d sat quietly on the bench, resigned to his fate. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect this result tonight and didn\u2019t expect such a stark difference between what we thought we could do and what happened,\u201d Bielsa told reporters.  \u201cThe key thing was they managed to play the kind of game they wanted and we did the opposite \u2013 that was the big difference. \u201cThe margin of their victory was not deserved, the difference was exaggerated \u2013 it was not in proportion to what I saw. What happened on pitch from my viewpoint is that they scored three goals and had eight chances; we had nine and scored none.\u201d"

        "content": "When Jackie Stewart speaks about driver safety in Formula One, it\u2019s worth listening. The racing legend was a pioneer in raising standards in an era when mortality rates were high, and his legacy has left F1 stars with greater support than ever before. But he is still worried about one burning issue \u2013 the controversy over sole supplier Pirelli\u2019s tires, which he says are dangerous due to their rapid rate of degradation. The three-time world champion told CNN that drivers risked a \u201cmultiple-car accident\u201d unless immediate improvements are made. \u201cI don\u2019t think that amount of rubber should be coming off the tires and be left to the side of the track,\u201d the 72-year-old said. \u201cIf you go over that rubber it then sticks to the terribly hot \u2013 above 100C (212F) \u2013 tires.  \u201cWhen you get to the next corner your car is now totally unstable, and when you\u2019re going to brake you\u2019ll probably lose control of your car. If there\u2019s a car close to you then that will cause a multiple-car accident \u2013 it has to be improved.\u201d The Scotsman, who notched up 27 wins in an F1 career spanning eight years, also blamed the tires for the exceptionally open season. Four different drivers have won each of the four races so far, ahead of the start of the European swing in Spain this weekend. \u201cAn issue that nobody can quite work out is how the tire wheel, tire temperatures work,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of winning and losing because of when people have chosen or not chosen to go into the pits.\u201d The \u201cFlying Scot\u201d \u2013 as he was nicknamed during his racing days \u2013 agreed with Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher\u2019s criticisms of the Italian tire manufacturer. Seven-time world champion Schumacher has complained about the quicker degradation of the tires and even likened them to driving on \u201con raw eggs.\u201d  McLaren team boss Martin Whitmarsh, whose drivers Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button struggled with their tires at the Bahrain Grand Prix, has also criticized Pirelli. Meanwhile Schumacher\u2019s teammate Nico Rosberg, who won the China Grand Prix last month, argued the unpredictability made racing interesting. Pirelli has argued it should be congratulated for such an open, unpredictable season. The manufacturer claimed it was simply responding to calls for more eventful racing, with director Paul Hembery saying: \u201cWe are pushing the limits.\u201d Stewart, who won the Spanish Grand Prix three times, said the high caliber of this season\u2019s drivers made it anyone\u2019s championship. \u201cThey\u2019re probably the best bunch of drivers I\u2019ve seen since the late \u201960s, early \u201870s when we had around eight or nine drivers capable of winning.\u201d He said Nico Rosberg\u2019s win in China could finally spell a comeback for Mercedes. It was the German marque\u2019s first race win since Juan Manuel Fangio in Italy in 1955. This week the team played down reports it could be set to quit F1. British newspaper The Times claimed UK-based Mercedes could be forced out over a power dispute arising from F1\u2019s proposed stock exchange flotation. A Mercedes spokesman said only that they were \u201cin discussions with the commercial rights holder.\u201d But Stewart believes this could be Mercedes\u2019 season, saying they were \u201cgiants.\u201d \u201cThe Silver Arrow has been winning races since the \u201920s and \u201830s and came back in the \u201850s and won races,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they hadn\u2019t won that race (in China) and showed themselves to be that competitive in the ones immediately following it, I think there might have been a chance of Mercedes Benz withdrawing from Formula One.\u201d"

        "content": "The European Court of Human Rights will not intervene again to stop Britain from deporting Abu Qatada, whom the British accuse of being a terrorist fundraiser and an inspiration to one of the hijackers on September 11, 2001, the court said Wednesday.  Britain has been trying for years to deport him to Jordan, but his legal appeals have kept him in the United Kingdom. The European Court blocked Britain from sending him to Jordan in January because of fears that evidence obtained by torture could be used against him in the trial the Middle Eastern country plans.  Britain then launched a round of negotiations with Jordan in order to deal with the European court\u2019s concerns and arrested Qatada again on April 17. British Home Secretary Theresa May announced that her country was starting a fresh effort to deport him, but Qatada\u2019s lawyers cried foul, saying he was filing a new appeal. That started a round of accusations and counter-accusations about whether the appeal had been filed in time, with the British government saying it was too late and Qatada\u2019s lawyer saying it was not.  The European Court ruled Wednesday that the appeal had been filed in time but rejected the appeal. Qatada can still go to British courts to appeal against deportation, May said Wednesday as she welcomed the European court ruling. \u201cIt has always been the Government\u2019s intention that the Qatada case should be heard in the British courts, so I am pleased by the European Court\u2019s decision today,\u201d May said in a statement. \u201cI remain confident that the assurances I have secured from the Jordanian government mean we will be able to put Qatada on a plane and get him out of Britain for good. His case will now go through the British courts.\u201d Jordan earlier convicted Qatada in absentia of terror-related offenses but will quash that conviction and retry him, May said in April. Qatada will be tried in public before civilian judges, she told British lawmakers at that time. \u201cThe assurances and information that the government has secured from Jordan mean that we can undertake deportation in full compliance with the law and with the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights,\u201d May said in a statement to the House of Commons. \u201cDeportation might still take time \u2013 the proper processes must be followed and the rule of law must take precedence \u2013 but today Qatada has been arrested and the deportation process is under way.\u201d Jordanian Justice Minister Ibrahim Aljazy had said after Britain announced the arrest that Jordan would detain Qatada and give him a full trial when he arrived in the country. Qatada was released on bail from a high-security prison in February. He had been imprisoned in Britain for six years while the government worked to send him to Jordan, where he holds citizenship. The British government claims Qatada has raised money for terrorist groups, including organizations linked to former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, and has publicly supported the violent activities of those groups. Qatada has denied the allegations against him. Also known as Omar Othman, Qatada arrived in the United Kingdom in 1993 and applied for asylum on the grounds that he had been tortured by Jordanian authorities. He came to Britain on a forged United Arab Emirates passport, according to court documents, and claimed asylum for himself, his wife and their three children. The British government recognized him as a refugee and allowed him to stay in the country until 1998. Qatada applied to stay indefinitely, but while his application was pending, a Jordanian court convicted him in absentia on charges related to two 1998 terrorist attacks and a plot to plant bombs to coincide with the millennium. He was taken into custody but was released briefly in 2005 after the repeal of the anti-terrorism law on which he was being held. Later that year, British authorities ordered his renewed detention under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, according to the European Court of Human Rights."

        "content": "World number two Rafael Nadal has sensationally lost to Fernando Verdasco 6-3 3-6 7-5 in the third round of the Madrid Open. The loss was the first defeat of the clay court season for the six-time French  Open champion. Considered arguably the greatest player to ever set foot on clay, Nadal had recently won in Monte Carlo \u2013 a record eighth title \u2013 before clinching his seventh tournament victory in Barcelona. He had previously beaten Verdasco in all 13 of their previous meetings. It took Verdasco three hours and 11 minutes to overcome Nadal in an error-strewn match. Verdasco hit nine double faults but Nadal somehow conspired to lose despite leading 5-2 in the final set.  It brought to an end a 22-match winning streak for Nadal that stretched back to 2011. \u201cI never was in control of the match, I didn\u2019t know how to win a point,\u201d  Nadal told reporters, before suggesting he will not show up next year unless the controversial blue clay surface is changed. \u201cMovement is very important for me and I couldn\u2019t move. I couldn\u2019t hit ball the way I wanted. I lost because I deserved to lose.\u201d The shock defeat will reopen the debate about the Madrid Open\u2019s use of blue clay. World number one Novak Djokovic has already been an outspoken critic of the surface.  \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to move,\u201d he told reporters earlier in the week.  \u201cI cannot find the words to describe this court. It\u2019s really tough to play like this on a center court. We need serious discussion about the future of this blue clay. \u201cWe cannot change anything this year, but my first impressions are not good. I don\u2019t want to be the one complaining, but I say honestly what I feel.\u201d Ironically it was Nadal that refused to be drawn on the issue of the blue clay after he had comfortably beaten Russia\u2019s Nikolay Davydenko in straight sets 6-2 6-2 on Wednesday. \u201cIt was my first match here in these circumstances,\u201d he said.  \u201cI am very happy about my result, about the way that I played.\u201d  But Nadal changed his tone after the defeat. \u201cI couldn\u2019t close out the match at 5-2. He played better than me,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe ATP and the tournament can do what they want, I tried my best, I\u2019ve  trained here since Thursday. I was as prepared as I could be. \u201cI was not good enough to adapt my game to this court. If things continue  like this, it will be very sad. Next year this will be one less event for my calendar.\u201d Verdasco will next play sixth-seeded Czech Tomas Berdych in the next round. Despite his complaints about the surface, Djokovic moved into the quarterfinals after beating Switzerland\u2019s Stanislas  Wawrinka 7-6 6-4.  Roger Federer also reached the quarterfinals after dispatching French 14th seed Richard Gasquet 6-3 6-2. The win, coupled with Nadal\u2019s shock loss, means that Federer will move up to second in the world rankings ahead of the Spaniard.  Meanwhile Serena Williams fought back after a disastrous start against Caroline Wozniacki to reach the quarterfinals of the women\u2019s event in Madrid.  The American lost the first set 6-1, before storming back 6-3 6-2 to set up a mouthwatering tie against Russian second seed Maria Sharapova, who made the last eight after Lucie Safarova  withdrew citing an illness. \u201cI had a slow start today, I don\u2019t know why,\u201d said Williams.  \u201cI was  sluggish and mentally maybe fighting some demons.\u201d Polish fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska continued her fine form by beating Italy\u2019s Roberta Vinci  7-6 (7-1) 6-4.

        "content": "Queen Elizabeth II laid out the British government\u2019s plans for the coming year in a speech Wednesday marked by pomp and tradition. In the speech scripted by politicians but read in the House of Lords by the monarch, she said her ministers would reduce the deficit, strengthen regulation of the financial sector, work to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons and promote stability in Afghanistan. The government will also act on proposals to force banks to split their retail and investment operations, she said. The speech lasted about 10 minutes, less time than it took her to travel by carriage from Buckingham Palace to Parliament.  In keeping with custom, her crown made the journey in a separate coach, and she donned her royal regalia in the Robing Room of the Palace of Westminster, the official name for the building where Parliament meets. Once the queen arrives for her annual speech, her official messenger, known as the Black Rod, goes to the House of Commons to summon lawmakers to her speech. By tradition, the door is slammed in his face, and he is required to pound on the door with his rod to get the attention of members of Parliament.  The lawmakers then follow the Black Rod to the House of Lords, where the queen reads a speech written by politicians outlining their legislative priorities. The monarch is not allowed to enter the House of Commons, where the elected members of Parliament sit, in memory of the failed effort of King Charles I to arrest lawmakers in the 17th century on the eve of the English Civil War. Elizabeth is celebrating her Diamond Jubilee this year, marking 60 years on the throne. "

        "content": "When Tiger Woods won the Players Championship for the first and only time, he was at the peak of his powers. In 2001, the tournament known as golf\u2019s unofficial \u201cfifth major\u201d was held the week before the Masters \u2013 and Woods won both events as he became the only modern-day player to hold all four major crowns at the same time, albeit not in a calendar year. This week, at the age of 36 and struggling to rediscover his best form, the American will again line up at TPC Sawgrass \u2013 but without the help of the man who helped him become the dominant force he was: coach Butch Harmon. Already he has had to fend off questions about his painfully long process of swing changes, and a disappointing showing at Augusta last month and then again at Quail Hollow last week, where he missed the halfway cut. Hopes had been raised by his pre-Masters victory at Bay Hill, his first on the PGA Tour in more than two years, but since then his work with current coach Sean Foley has been questioned by former players such as Nick Faldo and Brandel Chamblee, both now TV pundits. Chamblee offered: \u201cHe needs to fire Sean, call Butch. He\u2019s literally lost the art of the game, and I think Butch could help him.\u201d Faldo, who unlike Chamblee can call himself a major champion \u2013 six times over \u2013 is troubled by Woods\u2019 apparent lack of confidence. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t have the self-belief, the self-confidence that he obviously had, the Tiger of old \u2013 simple as that,\u201d the Englishman said. Woods, for his part, insists that his work in progress is similar to previous frustrating periods rebuilding his swing with Harmon and then Hank Haney \u2013 and he rebounded from those in a stellar career featuring 14 major titles and more than 80 professional victories. \u201cI went for probably almost two years without doing much with Butch before it kicked in, and about a year and a half with Hank,\u201d he told reporters ahead of Thursday\u2019s opening round.   \u201cWith Sean it\u2019s been almost two years. But I\u2019ve been hurt for a majority of that, so I haven\u2019t been able to put in the time. In essence, it takes time.  \u201cThe fruits have been pretty good on the back side of it, and I think so far I\u2019ve shown some nice consistency, and I\u2019m still working. I just haven\u2019t had the time because obviously the injuries I\u2019ve had.\u201d Woods did admit that he might be thinking too much about his game, rather than just playing. \u201cCertainly it is (like that) when you\u2019re making changes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve done this before. I\u2019ve been through this. I went through those periods where I wasn\u2019t quite where I wanted to be. I had some pretty good runs after that, and this is no different.   \u201cIt takes a little bit of time, and I keep building, and things eventually come around to where they feel natural and efficient. I think that\u2019s probably the most important word, is that you get out there and you feel efficient in what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Woods\u2019 recent performances have highlighted another part of his game that needs work: his putting \u2013 having needed 33 in the second round at Quail Hollow, and also struggling in finishing 40th at Augusta. \u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019m not quite 100% comfortable with it. I\u2019ve had to make some tweaks and some little bit of changes,\u201d he said.  \u201cAugusta was nice to have happen, actually, in the big scheme of things. Just like it was at Dubai a couple of years ago when I couldn\u2019t cut the golf ball. I felt like I could have won that golf tournament, but not being able to cut it cost me eight or nine shots that week.  \u201cAugusta was one of those things where it was just pretty glaring, some of the things I needed to work on. So get back to work and try and get ready for this week.\u201d Woods will be in a high-profile grouping on Thursday and Friday as he lines up alongside FedEx Cup series leader Hunter Mahan and another \u201cGolf Boy\u201d in Rickie Fowler, who won his first PGA Tour title at Quail Hollow last weekend. Rory McIlroy, who returned to world No. 1 by reaching the playoff on Sunday, will partner Steve Stricker and another veteran American, Phil Mickelson \u2013 who was inducted into golf\u2019s Hall of Fame on Monday and was champion at Ponte Vedra Beach in 2007.  Luke Donald, who the lost the top ranking after skipping Quail Hollow, will play alongside fellow former No. 1 Lee Westwood and 2011 FedEx Cup champion Bill Haas in the $9.5 million Florida tournament. Masters champion Bubba Watson has decided to stay home with his wife and newly-adopted baby son."

Alexis Tsipras of Syriza met with Evangelos Venizelos of the socialist PASOK party and Antonis Samaras of center-right New Democracy a day after laying out a radical agenda he hopes to pursue if he becomes prime minister.  Tsipras has until Thursday to form a government or admit defeat, but he faces an uphill task. \u201cAt this stage there is no solution,\u201d PASOK\u2019s Venizelos said. \u201cBut we must keep trying.\u201d If no one can pull together a coalition and no national unity government can be formed by May 17, Greece must call new elections. Tsipras is the second Greek politician to try to form a government after Sunday\u2019s elections in which voters angry about tough government budget cuts punished the parties that made the cuts. His left-wing Syriza party came in second in the elections as seven parties won seats in parliament but no party captured more than 19% of the vote. The  New Democracy party placed first, but party leader Samaras gave up efforts to form a government Monday, the same day he received the mandate from President Karolos Papoulias to try to lead the country. If Syriza fails by Thursday, then it will be PASOK\u2019s chance to form a coalition government. Venizelos has said that PASOK first will support a national unity government formed by pro-European parties.  If that doesn\u2019t happen, Venizelos said that PASOK would be willing to support a coalition formed of other parties as long as it would ensure Greece remains in the eurozone. Tsipras has called for the cancellation of the severe budget-cutting measures forced on the country by international lenders. Laws that cut pensions and salaries and those that \u201ccancel basic workers\u2019 rights\u201d must be annulled, Tsipras said. He also called for state control of the banks, which \u201cremain in the hands of the managers who bankrupted the system,\u201d he said. The Greek people voted clearly to reject the austerity demanded by international lenders, Tsipras said. Tsipras called on Venizelos of PASOK and Samaras of New Democracy to renounce publicly the deal they made with international lenders. Tsiprias said they \u201cdon\u2019t have a majority any more to vote for the plundering of the Greek people.\u201d Samaras said that the Syriza leader was doing everything possible to ensure no government would be formed. He said that Tsipras\u2019 proposals would result in Greece exiting the eurozone, the group of 17 countries that use the common European currency. Communist Party leader Aleka Papariga spoke with Tsipras by phone but will not meet him, Syriza said. Fotis Kouvelis of the Democratic Left, which splintered from Syriza in 2010, told Tsipras when they met that Syriza needed the support of more than just the left, Tsipras\u2019 bloc said. The Ecologist Greens also rejected Syriza\u2019s approach for support Tuesday, saying a road map to exit the crisis was needed. The Greek elections came the same day that French voters kicked out President Nicolas Sarkozy in favor of Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who spoke out against austerity in his victory speech. Syriza more than tripled its parliamentary representation to 51 seats out of 300 in the balloting Sunday. The election results were widely seen as a message to politicians to back away from the harsh economic austerity measures imposed in Greece. A European Commission spokeswoman said this week that Greece needs time to work through its political process but reminded the country\u2019s leaders that they would be expected to abide by terms of a bailout program meant to avoid a crippling financial meltdown. \u201cThe commission hopes and expects that the future government of Greece will respect the engagements that Greece has entered into,\u201d spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen told reporters. New Democracy finished first in Sunday\u2019s voting but ended up with only 108 seats in Greece\u2019s 300-seat parliament.  Voters also delivered a rebuke to PASOK \u2013 New Democracy\u2019s socialist partner in the outgoing coalition government \u2013 stripping the party of 119 seats. Together, the parties fell short of the 50% necessary to continue the coalition, requiring formation of a new government. Last year, Greece\u2019s debt threatened to force it to drop Europe\u2019s common currency, the euro, prompting the European Central Bank and other lenders to swoop in with emergency funding. In exchange, they demanded that the government slash spending. The resulting measures have led to tax increases and cuts in jobs, wages, pensions and benefits \u2013 and significant public outcry. The national unemployment rate for January, the latest month for which figures are available, was nearly 22%, prompting widespread protests and leading some young people to leave the country in search of work.  Youth unemployment is even higher than the national average of one in five out of work. For two years, the country\u2019s massive amount of debt has threatened the stability of the 17-country eurozone. Greece pushed through a huge debt swap in March to save it from disorderly default and clear the way for it to receive a second bailout from the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, worth \u20ac130 billion ($171.5 billion). The debt restructuring deal gave some breathing space to the eurozone bloc, where fears that Greece might collapse had increased pressure on other debt-laden nations such as Spain and Italy. The tribulations of New Democracy and PASOK were matched by triumphs of a number of other parties that were also-rans and in some cases nonexistent just a few years ago, propelled by voters angry about stringent austerity measures."

        "content": "Rafael Nadal easily progressed to the third round of the Madrid Open after beating Russia\u2019s Nikolay Davydenko in straight sets 6-2 6-2 on Wednesday. It was the King of Clay\u2019s first work out on Madrid\u2019s controversial new blue clay surface but the world number two had little problem in dispensing with Davydenko in just over 80 minutes.  \u201cI think that I played a really good match,\u201d he told the ATP Tour\u2019s official website after setting up a clash with fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco.  \u201cIt was my first match here in these circumstances. I am very happy about my result, about the way that I played.\u201d His affable demeanor contrasted sharply with world number one Novak Djokovic, who had made tough work of beating Spanish qualifier Daniel Gimeno-Traver 6-2 3-6 6-2 on Tuesday. Djokovic had plenty to say about the blue clay after a minor scare on his first competitive outing on the new surface. The world No. 1 thought the players should have been consulted on Madrid\u2019s decision to depart from the traditional red clay and the Serbian cut a frustrated figure on court.  \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to move,\u201d he was quoted as telling reporters by AFP.  \u201cI hit maybe five balls, the rest went just trying to put the ball into the court. \u201cI was relying on serve and getting free points from his unforced errors. That was not tennis, either I need football shoes or some advice on how to play on this court. \u201cI cannot find the words to describe this court. It\u2019s really tough to play like this on a center court. We need serious discussion about the future of this blue clay. \u201cWe cannot change anything this year, but my first impressions are not good. I don\u2019t want to be the one complaining, but I say honestly what I feel.\u201d World No. 3 Roger Federer survived a big scare against rising star Milos Raonic in Wednesday\u2019s late match, finally triumphing 4-6 7-5 7-6 (7-4) after more than two hours on court. \u201cI had a tough first set and one bad game that cost me the set really,\u201d said Federer, who won the event on hard court in 2006 and then in its first year on clay in 2009.  \u201cHe could swing big on my service games and I couldn\u2019t do that much on his, but I was getting more balls back as the match went on. I played a good tie-breaker overall.\u201d Federer, playing his first match in five weeks following a third-round exit in Miami, will next play French 14th seed Richard Gasquet. \u201cIt was pretty much a big struggle for me tonight but the level is pretty good and I\u2019m happy where I am in the season,\u201d the 16-time grand slam champion said. It was a big disappointment for world No. 23 Raonic, who dominated for large spells of the match with his booming serve and powerful groundstrokes. \u201cI felt like I was on top throughout the whole match,\u201d Raonic said. \u201cI will probably be more happy with the whole outcome in a few days but now is not the right time.\u201d In the women\u2019s draw in Madrid, French Open champion Li Na booked her quarterfinal place by beating Angelique Kerber of Germany 7-5 6-4. Li broke the the German number two on three occasions as she continued her fine form on clay after reaching the quarterfinals of the Stuttgart Open last month.  China\u2019s leading player will next face world No.1 Victoria Azarenka, who beat former top-ranked Ana Ivanovic of Serbia 6-4 6-4. U.S. Open champion Samantha Stosur of Australian also reached the last eight with a 6-3 6-2 win over Czech Petra Cetkovska.  Polish fourth seed  Agnieszka Radwanska ended the 16-match clay court  winning streak of Italy\u2019s Sara Errani in spectacular fashion with a 6-0 6-1 rout in their second-round match. "

The economically struggling European country will stop giving workers a day off for Corpus Christi and All Saints\u2019 Day, starting next year, the government said. It will also eliminate two civil holidays to be fair, the statement said Tuesday. The center-right government thanked the Holy See and the Portuguese Bishops\u2019 Conference for their \u201cconstructive approach\u201d to the negotiations. Portugal and the Vatican will re-evaluate the agreement in five years, the government said. Economy ministry spokesman Hugo Soares declined to say how cutting the holidays would boost the economy. The opposition Socialists and Communists did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. Portugal, a largely Catholic country, is struggling with recession and debt. Along with the economies of Greece, Italy, Ireland and Spain, its economy is a cause for concern across the 17 countries that use the euro as their currency."

        "content": "The 60th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s accession to the British throne marks a major milestone in the remarkable life of a monarch who, though reluctantly thrust into the spotlight at a young age, has won almost universal praise for her steadfast dedication to duty. Her long reign (second only to Queen Victoria\u2019s) has seen Britain transformed from a war-weary declining imperial power into its modern incarnation as a member state of the European Union that rarely looks to its monarch for leadership, but still holds her in high esteem. And while it has witnessed its fair share of joy \u2013 not least the recent marriage of the queen\u2019s grandson Prince William to Catherine Middleton \u2013 Elizabeth\u2019s rule has also weathered many storms, both public and personal, as the monarchy has tried to keep pace with changing times. Elizabeth Alexander Mary was born in 1926, the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York. She did not become heiress presumptive to the throne until 1937 when her father was crowned King George VI after the scandalous abdication of his older brother \u2013 events recently dramatized in the Oscar-winning film \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech.\u201d As World War II erupted, Elizabeth was quietly groomed for statehood. While living out the blitz on London in nearby Windsor Castle, she was privately tutored in matters of constitution by Henry Marten, an eccentric yet respected teacher who reputedly kept a pet raven in his study. She began making tentative steps to public life in 1940 when, aged 14, she made her first radio broadcast: a speech to children displaced by conflict. At 16 she was made an honorary colonel of the Grenadier Guards, a British army infantry regiment. Wartime offered her certain freedoms beyond the constraints of royal life. In 1945 she joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service, and spent four weeks getting her hands covered in oil and grease as she learned to drive and maintain military vehicles. When victory was declared in Europe, a uniformed Elizabeth mingled with jubilant crowds outside Buckingham Palace. Queen Elizabeth celebrates 60 years on throne Peacetime brought the return of Lieutenant Prince Philip of Greece, a handsome young naval officer who had, by all accounts, had won her heart when she was just 13. The pair married in Westminster Abbey in 1947. Their first son, Charles, was born just over a year later. With her father\u2019s health in rapid decline, Elizabeth began accepting more official duties, taking his place at the annual Trooping the Color military parade in 1949. In 1952, when Elizabeth and Philip were on an official trip to Kenya, news came of her father\u2019s death. She was now queen. The next decade saw the queen settle into her role. After her 1953 coronation, she embarked on numerous official trips, oversaw state openings of parliament, welcomed visiting leaders such as President Eisenhower, Charles de Gaulle and Nikita Khrushchev, and toured a coal mine. In 1964, the queen became a mother for the fourth time as new son Edward joined Charles and fellow siblings Anne and Andrew. There was, however, barely any let up in her busy schedule. By the arrival of her third decade on the throne, she was in her element. Prince Charles was embarking on a military career, Princess Anne, an acclaimed horsewoman, was married \u2013 drawing huge crowds of well wishers. Girls given equal rights to British throne under law changes While indulging in her own equestrian pursuits, she continued to throw herself into public life, clocking up dozens of overseas trips and official visits around the UK \u2013 one of which in 1976 saw her become one of the first people to send an email (she continues to champion new technology today). There were family problems in 1976 when her sister\u2019s marriage collapsed and constitutional problems with growing debate among Commonwealth countries about the role of the monarch, but these failed to dampen celebrations to mark the silver jubilee of her reign in 1977. Another royal wedding followed in 1981 when Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer at London\u2019s St Paul\u2019s cathedral. Millions of people around the world watched the ceremony on television, happily unaware it would usher in the most turbulent period yet of the queen\u2019s life. The queen\u2019s 40th year on the throne, 1992, marked her lowest moment as three royal marriages fell apart. Princess Anne and Mark Philips divorced, Charles and Diana separated after claims of infidelities while Sarah Ferguson was photographed topless with an American financial manager. To cap it all, a huge fire ripped through Windsor Castle causing major structural damage. In the wake of the blaze, a furore broke out when it was suggested that public money be used to fund the restoration. \u201c1992 is not a year on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure,\u201d the queen said in a speech later that year. \u201cIn the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents, it has turned out to be an annus horribilis.\u201d Kate has graduated as \u2018fully fledged\u2019 royal These problems overshadowed the queen as she made an historic visit to meet Nelson Mandela in 1995, but criticism reached new heights in the wake of Diana\u2019s tragic death in 1997 when the royals were accused of being aloof and out of touch amid widespread outpourings of grief. This marked a turning point. After days of silence, the queen returned to London, talked to mourners and admitted there were lessons to be learned from Diana\u2019s life. The gestures struck a chord with the public and criticism ebbed away. After Diana, the queen\u2019s popularity rebounded as she presided over what appeared to be a softer, more accessible and thoroughly modern royal family. This was evident In 2005 when, to public approval, she assented to the previously unthinkable marriage of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. The queen\u2019s most recent decade as monarch has largely been one of celebration. In 2006, she marked her 80th birthday with a series of festivities and goodwill messages from around the world. She has witnessed both her grandsons graduate as military officers and, of course, she oversaw the marriage of Prince William and Catherine, the woman who \u2013 when her husband eventually inherits the throne to become king \u2013 will succeed her as Britain\u2019s next queen."

The $80 million striker was roundly booed by the supporters who used to idolize him as Liverpool gained a modicum of revenge for Saturday\u2019s FA Cup final defeat. Tuesday\u2019s comprehensive loss means Chelsea must now beat Bayern Munich in the Champions League final on May 19 in order to qualify for the competition next season. It also means Chelsea will end the Premier League season in sixth \u2013 the London club\u2019s lowest placing for a decade.

And defender Daniel Agger got number three as he tucked home a knock down from striker Andy Carroll, who scored Liverpool\u2019s only goal at Wembley on Saturday.  The former Newcastle forward, who started the match this time, won a penalty just before halftime after he was elbowed in the chest by Branislav Ivanovic but Stewart Downing hit the post from the spot. Chelsea clawed a goal back as Brazilian midfielder Ramires bundled a free-kick over the line but Jonjo Shelvey restored Liverpool\u2019s three-goal lead on the hour mark.

        "content": "Two European elections, in France and Greece, have thrust the radical fringe into the spotlight. In Greece, voters disillusioned by a brutal austerity program pushed through by the two mainstream parties have turned instead to parties on the far left and far right. As a result, a leftist coalition opposed to austerity is seeking to form a government, and Golden Dawn \u2013 an ultranationalist party linked to street violence and neo-Nazism \u2013 stands to claim around 20 seats in the new parliament. France saw a swing to the left in Sunday\u2019s runoff, with Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande ousting center-right incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. But the strong showing by far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen in the first round of the presidential election undoubtedly played into campaigning, with both candidates reaching out to the 6.5 million voters who backed her. Each pledged to crack down on illegal immigration, though Sarkozy went further in promising to cut the number of legal migrants by half in the next five years. Two very different outcomes, but with a common thread: the efforts of extremist parties to win support by plugging into popular discontent over the financial crisis, against the backdrop of a wider social unease and anti-immigrant sentiment. Across Europe, anger at a perceived mismanagement of the economic crisis, and accompanying high unemployment, low growth and painful cuts, has seen a string of governments fall  Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Finland, Romania and Italy are among them as well as the Netherlands, where the refusal of the far-right Freedom Party to back austerity measures led the government to collapse last month. The current turbulence of Europe\u2019s politics may lead to more uncomfortable alliances in the future \u2013 although such attempts can also backfire.  Keen to swing France\u2019s sizable far-right bloc behind him, Sarkozy vowed to keep an open ear to the concerns of the National Front, even as he ruled out any formal pact with the party. \u201cI refuse to demonize the men and women who in voting for Marine Le Pen expressed a crisis vote, a vote of anger, a vote of suffering and a vote of despair,\u201d he said on French radio. \u201cI have to take their message into account, I have to listen to them, I have to hear them and not hold my nose.\u201d But many critics perceived him as lurching far to the right on issues such as immigration.  Announcing his decision to back Hollande, centrist Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, who took 9% of the vote in the first round, said he could not support Sarkozy because the views he now espoused were incompatible with his party\u2019s values. Even so, will the region\u2019s economic insecurity translate into greater gains for the far right? Europe\u2019s far-right parties are definitely seeing a resurgence, according to Matthew Feldman, director of the Radicalism and New Media Research Group at the University of Northampton, but the trend is not universal and the austerity crisis is only one part of the picture. He said the far-right movement has been gaining ground for years, thanks partly to efforts to revamp its previously overtly racist and fascist image. This doesn\u2019t mean that those racist or Nazi-sympathizing elements don\u2019t still exist within different countries\u2019 far-right groups, he said, but those at the top have often learned to present a more acceptable public face.  Instead of open racial attacks, they play up a threat to national identity and criticize multiculturalism, particularly as it relates to Islam, Feldman said. On the campaign trail, National Front leader Le Pen called for France to leave the eurozone and restore its currency, the franc, as well as criticizing its political integration into the European Union. But her rhetoric also drew on an anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim sentiment that has deep roots in France and elsewhere. That discourse was likely also a factor in Sarkozy turning the labeling of halal meat into an election issue and his comments that there are \u201ctoo many foreigners\u201d in France. The more research he does, Feldman said, the more it seems that \u201cthe lowest common denominator of this entire far-right narrative is that Islam is barbaric and a threat to European stability and peace.\u201d A report by rights group Amnesty International last month highlighted the issue, saying Muslims in Europe face discrimination in education, employment and religious freedom. Feldman draws a parallel with the anti-Semitism of the 20th century and earlier. \u201cWe are still seeing \u2018Europe for the Europeans,\u2019 and that\u2019s something we could have seen 80 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t give us perfect examples of replaying the past, but I think there\u2019s a lesson to take away.  \u201cIn times of uncertainty and great change, finding scapegoats has always been a populist vote winner, and the scapegoat in this century is Muslims in Europe.\u201d Michael Minkenberg, a professor of political science at Germany\u2019s European University Viadrina in Frankfurt (Oder) who has also taught at New York, Cornell and Columbia universities,  said he sees concern over immigration, law and order \u201cand the feeling that things aren\u2019t what they used to be any more\u201d as being at the heart of support for Europe\u2019s radical right. Euroscepticism, as resistance to greater European political integration is known, is also on the increase, he said, and \u201cthere\u2019s this anxiety about what will happen, a growing complexity and not much reassurance from either national governments or the European Union.\u201d Coupled with a mistrust of the political elite, this has also led to a swell of support for the far right in Austria, Belgium and Scandinavian countries, Minkenberg said, while in Hungary, the far-right Jobbik party won a significant chunk of the vote in 2010. Despite that trend, analysts caution against drawing sweeping conclusions from the far right\u2019s gains in France and Greece. The National Front has been well-entrenched in France\u2019s political life for decades under Jean-Marie Le Pen before his daughter Marine took charge last year, said Thomas Klau of the European Council on Foreign Relations. As such, its achievement in taking a fifth of the votes in the first round of voting, while notable, did not indicate a sudden rise to prominence for the far right, he said. Hollande told the daily Liberation newspaper ahead of the runoff that he saw the strong showing for the National Front as an expression of people\u2019s \u201csocial anger\u201d rather than a firm adherence to the party\u2019s more extremist views. It revealed a discontent particularly in rural areas and among working-class voters, he said, with many feeling abandoned by the government. Perhaps reflecting that disillusionment, 2 million French voters deliberately spoiled their ballot papers after Marine Le Pen said that was what she would do. Nonetheless, Klau argues that a feature of recent ballots in Europe has been the readiness of voters to change their governments without turning to the political extremes, as seen in Spain\u2019s election in November.  \u201cVoters have been single-minded across the eurozone in terms of expressing their dissatisfaction at how the crisis has been run by the government in charge, whatever their political hue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, they have sufficient confidence in their own political system to replace their governments with the mainstream political opposition.\u201d In Britain, local elections last week saw big losses for the coalition government of the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, blamed for unpopular austerity measures. But there was no accompanying swing to the radical fringe, Feldman said. The far-right British National Party in fact lost all six of the seats it was defending in local councils and failed to win any new ones. The opposition center-left Labour Party was the main beneficiary of the coalition\u2019s losses. In the Netherlands, Klau said the impact of Dutch politician Geert Wilders\u2019 decision to withdraw his Freedom Party\u2019s support for the government, triggering its collapse, would have only a temporary destabilizing effect. The economy will be central to the election of a new government, with elections due in September, but the far right does not attract the same level of support as in France. Wilders, who wants a referendum on the euro, preferred to exit the coalition than lose political credibility by backing the painful cuts demanded by Europe, said Kostas Gemenis at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. Those demands from Europe are also at the heart of Greece\u2019s political turmoil as voters in the heavily indebted nation revolt against the harsh budget-cutting medicine doled out by the European Union and International Monetary Fund.  The success of Golden Dawn, with its unprecedented 7% share of the vote, is a manifestation of what could be described as economic meltdown, Feldman said. But at the same time, he said, \u201c7% is too much, but it\u2019s not 27% or 37%. I\u2019m not sure now is the time to panic about the rise of the far right. Golden Dawn is not something that is replicable across Europe.\u201d And while Golden Dawn gained strength, another far-right party, LAOS, lost its small presence in the 300-seat parliament as voters punished it for its support for Greece\u2019s austerity program, Gemenis pointed out. Gemenis said the profile of the Golden Dawn voter \u2013 revealed through the Choose4Greece website he jointly set up to help voters work out their political affiliation amid a welter of parties \u2013 was typically male, aged under 50 and from a lower educational background. Some 45% of those who said they intended to vote for Golden Dawn this time around had backed one of the two mainstream parties, PASOK and New Democracy, in 2009, while a fifth had backed LAOS, Gemenis said. If the far-left Syriza group fails to form a workable coalition, it seems likely a new Greek election will be called next month. But whether this will mean further gains for Golden Dawn is hard to predict, Gemenis said. \u201cThe framing of the issue by the media might play a role, but it is impossible to say what will be the consequences of the media attacking the far right versus tacitly ignoring it,\u201d he said, referring to the approach taken by Greek media so far.  So, does the far right present a broader threat to European freedoms? How extreme the anti-immigration debate becomes depends very much on the individual country, Minkenberg said. Farther east, a different strand of far-right thinking dominates in countries such as Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, he said. There, far-right groups poll around 10% but tend to be more nationalistic in tone, he said, with anti-Semitism and anti-Roma views seen as more legitimate than elsewhere in Europe. Feldman highlights the far right\u2019s recent apparent moves to establish a pan-European cultural movement that has Islam in its sights as the biggest risk. Far-right groups from Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, Germany and Eastern Europe gathered last month in the Danish city of Aarhus for what they said was a rally to make their governments aware of the threat of Islamic extremism. Although it was dwarfed by a left-wing counterdemonstration, the protest was significant as an attempt by the far-right groups to create a common trajectory, he said. Less clear is how much traction their extreme views can gain.  \u201cIt\u2019s clear that a large minority across Europe isn\u2019t comfortable with these things \u2013 demographic change and multiculturalism,\u201d Feldman said. \u201cBut what the far right offers is not something that many can accept.\u201d"

        "content": "No one used the word reward, but the subtext was clear for all to see. In April 2007, when Poland and Ukraine were surprisingly awarded the right to co-host the 2012 European Championship \u2013 one of international football\u2019s top tournaments after the World Cup \u2013 both countries\u2019 delegations exploded with joy. For the Ukrainians it was especially poignant. At the center of the celebrations was President Viktor Yushchenko, who had come to power leading the 2004 Orange Revolution, ignited when the election battle between him and the then Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych was allegedly riddled with fraud. Massive street protests swept away the old regime, whose last desperate attempt to cling on to power, according to supporters of Yushchenko, was a plot to poison the challenger. Yushchenko barely survived.  But survive he did, and the chance to host Euro 2012 was redemption. Ukraine was finally, post communism, moving towards democracy and the rule of law. Euro 2012 represented a chance, as the Olympics did in Seoul and Tokyo decades before, for sport to welcome Ukraine into the club of free nations. \u201cWe will be able to show millions of fans the unforgettable charm of our cities and the history they have preserved so beautifully,\u201d Yushchenko said when Ukraine\u2019s joint bid was selected to host the tournament.  \u201cAnd put on display of Slav hospitality and culture.\u201d A coronation The final in Kiev on July 1, 2012, was to be the coronation. But with a month to go until Ukraine was to enjoy its moment in the sun, Yushchenko\u2019s words ring hollow. He was voted out of power in 2010, his Orange Revolution unraveling as, according to his supporters, the new president Yanukovych \u2013 ironically the man he defeated in 2004 \u2013 tries to roll back the gains made eight years ago. And far from highlighting Ukraine\u2019s development, Euro 2012 has done the opposite. Instead European statesmen and women are boycotting the event as the blond heroine of the Orange Revolution, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, languishes in a prison cell thanks to what her supporters claim are spurious political charges.  Last week her family released pictures of what they say is proof that Tymoshenko was beaten up in prison, which the Ukrainian government denies.  \u201cHer condition is worsening, her physical condition,\u201d her daughter Eugenia Tymoshenko told CNN.  \u201cThat was after eight days of hunger strike. She was already much weaker because of the attacks when they beat her on April 20. Because of her protest her morale is very strong (but) we have asked her to stop her hunger strike.\u201d Tymoshenko has been in prison since October last year. She received a seven-year sentence for abuse of power over the signing of a gas deal with Russia that the current president deemed detrimental to the national interest. But few outside of Ukraine saw it as anything other than the persecution of a political rival. \u201cOnce she was arrested, there was a whole machine that started working,\u201d said Eugenia.  \u201cThey wanted to keep her in jail as her popularity was growing. She is now more popular. It is mostly fear that moved him and his people to keep her there until the (parliamentary) elections in October this year.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just political repression and they have moved to physical destruction. That has become critical. My mother is now on hunger strike because other political prisoners are suffering in jail with no medical help.\u201d  Political controversy  The pictures of Tymoshenko, baring her bruises to the camera, have created a firestorm in Europe\u2019s corridors of power. When it emerged that Germany\u2019s Chancellor Angela Merkel was considering a boycott of the event to protest Tymoshenko\u2019s treatment, other EU leaders followed suit.  EU president Herman Van Rompuy has said he won\u2019t attend \u2013 as has Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, who less than 12 months ago had met with President Yanukovych and was presented with an official Euro 2012 match ball. The governments of Austria and Belgium have all said they will not be attending. Poland\u2019s opposition, who were in power when the Euros were awarded, has called for Ukraine\u2019s matches to be moved to Warsaw. The British and German governments are re-evaluating their positions.  Even some of the players have spoken out. Germany captain Philipp Lahm told newspaper Der Spiegel that he did not find his \u201cviews of democratic fundamental rights, human rights, personal freedom or press freedom to be reflected in the present political situation in Ukraine.\u201d  While Russian premier Vladimir Putin has criticized the boycotts \u2013 stating that \u201cyou can\u2019t mix politics, business and other issues with sport\u201d \u2013 and the Ukrainian foreign ministry has condemned the outcry for causing \u201cdamage to the interests of millions of ordinary Ukrainians that vote for various political parties or are not interested in politics at all,\u201d others point the finger of blame for the crisis at the Ukrainian government.  \u201cThere has been progress in many ways and the last round of elections that elected Yanukovych was largely free and fair,\u201d admitted Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director of Human Rights Watch.  \u201cBut we have particular concerns about what Yanukovych has done in prosecuting his political opponents. Few (Ukrainian government figures) have spoken out about her (Tymoshenko\u2019s) mistreatment and there\u2019s clear evidence that the charges against her are politically motivated.\u201d Should fans boycott? While Human Rights Watch stops short of calling for a fan boycott of the tournament, it does support moves by political leaders to make a stand. \u201cShould politicians watch matches? We think they should speak out clearly. If they decide to not see a match \u2026 we welcome that that is a clear signal,\u201d Williamson said.  \u201cOne could see a more extreme case with China and the (2008) Olympics. There\u2019s a clear risk that by allowing such countries to host such sporting contests, it legitimizes their actions.\u201d  Yet the scandal has highlighted a much more fundamental tension at the heart of Ukrainian society: whether, as those that led the Orange Revolution contest, Ukraine\u2019s future lays westwards, towards the EU; or whether its future is in the east and with Russia, the direction in which the current president is moving.  \u201cThe story of the European Championships was supposed to be bridge building between the two different Europes, cooperation across borders between east and west,\u201d argued Dr. Andrew Wilson, an expert in Ukrainian politics at Britain\u2019s University College London.   \u201cBut no, the story now is the good performance of Poland. Their success is in stark contrast with the problems in Ukraine.\u201d He also suggested that the criticism that has followed the Tymoshenko case could push many Ukrainians away from EU integration, and towards the Kremlin\u2019s sphere of influence.  \u201cYes the boycott will have an effect,\u201d Wilson said.  \u201cPrestige matters to this guy Yanukovych. They hoped the Euros would give them prestige. The argument that Ukrainians will turn to Russia is one made by Ukrainians. They say: \u2018Criticize us after we\u2019ve made it, not before.\u2019 \u201d  Not everyone is sympathetic to Tymoshenko\u2019s plight in Ukraine. President Yanukovych has repeatedly said that there was a criminal case to answer for. \u201cIf Tymoshenko were looking for a compromise she would tell the truth to the Ukrainian people about why she broke the law,\u201d he told British newspaper The Times in a bellicose interview last year. Orange fatigue  And others point to Tymoshenko\u2019s poor political performance while prime minister for the lack of sympathy she has received in Ukraine.  \u201cThe Orange Revolution was a huge disappointment,\u201d explained Wilson. \u201cMedia improved, civil society is stronger, but the Orange leaders fought like rats in a sack, especially Tymoshenko and former President Yushchenko. After five years of infighting, there was Orange fatigue.\u201d Others in Ukraine point to the the failure of arguably the most infamous sporting boycott in history: the decision by the U.S. to snub the 1980 Moscow Olympics in protest at the Soviet Union\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan. The Soviets returned the favor four years after for the 1984 Los Angeles Games. \u201cThe experience of boycotting the Olympic Games of 1980 in Moscow by the West and the counter strike (by the) Socialist camp of the Games in Los Angeles did not influence political events too much but spoiled the careers of some great athletes,\u201d says Oleg Zadernovsky, a Ukrainian sports journalist who writes for World Soccer magazine.  \u201cThe whole country expects something similar to a game of football with two halves.  \u201cAt first Ukrainians would like to host with honor and dignity the biggest ever sporting event on its territory, while the second half will start in October this year when many of them will go to the ballot boxes to support opposition parties who promise to free Yulia Tymoshenko.\u201d  Yet for all the pressure, the tournament is unlikely to be moved. In a statement, the head of Ukraine\u2019s Euro 2012 organizing committee Markiyan Lubkivskyi admitted that while \u201cthere are certain appeals by European politicians to UEFA\u201d over the issue of Tymoshenko as well as a myriad of other security concerns, \u201cthe issue of moving the tournament (to Poland) was not considered even theoretically. It is impossible from a technical point of view or otherwise.\u201d But as the political row rages, Tymoshenko remains in jail on hunger strike as Ukraine\u2019s reputation crumbles. What once seemed like a reward now looks like a curse. Eugenia Tymoshenko believes that the blame rests with one man. \u201cThe political boycott is the result of the government and the actions of President Yanukovych that are against European standards that the EU wants to see,\u201d she said. \u201cThe previous government had given (Ukraine) this wondrous opportunity for this celebration of sport with the European Championships.  \u201cAnd I think European leaders do not want to be see (the president) use this politically, using repression and torture against political opponents.\u201d "

        "content": "Carles Puyol is poised to miss Spain\u2019s defense of their European Championship crown after Barcelona confirmed their captain will be out for six weeks with a knee injury. The 34-year-old felt pain in his knee after his side\u2019s 4-0 victory in the Barcelona derby against Espanyol on Saturday \u2013 a game in which he scored. The Catalan club have confirmed Puyol will undergo surgery to correct the problem and as a result he will miss the Copa Del Rey final against Athletic Bilbao on May 25. That match also represents coach Pep Guardiola\u2019s last game in charge of the club after he, together with Puyol as skipper, led Barcelona to an unprecedented 13 trophies in his four-year tenure. A statement on the club\u2019s official website read: \u201cCarles Puyol will not be featuring in the Copa del Rey Final on May 25.  \u201cThe Medical Services have announced that the player ended the game on Saturday against Espanyol feeling pain in his right knee.  \u201c\u2018Following complementary tests, we have decided to subject the player to arthroscopy next Saturday May 12,\u2019 they said.  \u201cThe surgery will be directed by Doctor Ramon Cugat. The Catalan is expected to need about six weeks to recover.\u201d With Spain\u2019s opening game of Euro 2012 coming against Italy on June 10, it means coach Vicente del Bosque could be without one of his stalwarts for the tournament. Puyol will be a big loss for Spain. He played all but seven minutes of their successful 2010 World Cup campaign in South Africa and scored the winner in his country\u2019s semifinal victory over Germany. He played the full 120 minutes in the final against Netherlands as Spain won soccer\u2019s biggest prize for the first time in their history. Two years prior to that, Puyol was also an integral part of the Spanish team that won the European Championships in Austria and Switzerland."

        "content": "Greek leftist leader Alexis Tsipras on Tuesday laid out the radical agenda he hopes to pursue if he becomes prime minister, including the cancellation of severe budget-cutting measures forced on the country by international lenders. Laws that cut pensions and salaries and those that \u201ccancel basic workers\u2019 rights\u201d must be annulled, Tsipras said as he started efforts to form a governing coalition in the wake of Sunday\u2019s parliamentary elections. He also called for state control of the banks, which \u201cremain in the hands of the managers who bankrupted the system,\u201d he said. The Greek people voted clearly to reject the austerity demanded by international lenders, said Tsipras, leader of the Syriza Party. The two parties that made the agreement with international lenders \u201cdon\u2019t have a majority any more to vote for the plundering of the Greek people,\u201d Tsipras told lawmakers. He said he was planning to meet the leaders of those parties Wednesday but called on Evangelos Venizelos of PASOK and Antonis Samaras of New Democracy to renounce publicly the deal they made with international lenders before then. Samaras said what Tsipras was proposing would result in Greece exiting the eurozone, and that the Syriza leader was doing everything possible to ensure no government would be formed. Venizelos said PASOK would not form a coalition with Syriza, as the party would only participate in a coalition government that would secure Greece\u2019s position in the eurozone. Greek media reported that Tsipras was preparing to send a letter to the European Union, but it was not immediately known what he planned to say.  Tsipras met Greek President Karolos Papoulias earlier Tuesday to get instructions to try to cobble together a government in the wake of elections that left the country\u2019s political system in chaos. Syriza will have three days to form a government. Communist Party leader Aleka Papariga spoke with Tsipras by phone but will not meet him, Syriza said. Fotis Kouvelis of the Democratic Left, which splintered from Syriza in 2010, told Tsipras that when they met Tuesday Syriza needed the support of more than just the left, Tsipras\u2019 bloc said. The Ecologist Greens also rejected Syriza\u2019s approach for support Tuesday, saying a road map to exit the crisis was needed. Syriza came in second in the elections, in which seven parties got seats in parliament and no party captured more than 19% of the vote. The Greek stock market dropped about 5% in early trading before recovering somewhat Tuesday. The market had fallen more than 6% Monday. The Greek elections came the same day that French voters kicked out President Nicolas Sarkozy in favor of Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who spoke out against austerity in his victory speech Sunday. The failure of Greece\u2019s main center-right party to form a coalition government Monday added yet more uncertainty to the debt-ridden country\u2019s political situation. New Democracy leader Samaras said he did \u201ceverything possible\u201d to form a coalition, but none of the parties agreed to join with his party, which won first crack at forming a government after finishing first in Sunday\u2019s parliamentary elections. Politicians have until May 17 to come up with a new working alliance or, if they cannot, set a date for another round of elections.  Syriza more than tripled its parliamentary representation to 51 seats out of 300 in the balloting. Tsipras left little doubt Sunday about what direction his party would take in a new government. \u201cEuropean leadership and especially (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel have to understand that austerity policies have suffered defeat,\u201d Tsipras said. He called the election results \u201ca message of a peaceful revolution.\u201d The election results were widely seen as a message to politicians to back away from the harsh economic austerity measures imposed in Greece. A European Commission spokeswoman said Monday that Greece needs time to work through its political process but reminded the country\u2019s leaders that they would be expected to abide by terms of a bailout program meant to avoid a crippling financial meltdown. \u201cThe commission hopes and expects that the future government of Greece will respect the engagements that Greece has entered into,\u201d spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen told reporters. New Democracy finished first in Sunday\u2019s voting but ended up with only 108 seats in Greece\u2019s 300-seat parliament.  Voters also delivered a rebuke to PASOK \u2013 New Democracy\u2019s socialist partner in the outgoing coalition government \u2013 stripping the party of 119 seats. Together, the parties fell short of the 50% necessary to continue the coalition, requiring formation of a new government. Last year, Greece\u2019s debt threatened to force it to drop Europe\u2019s common currency, the euro, prompting the European Central Bank and other lenders to swoop in with emergency funding. In exchange, they demanded that the government slash spending. The resulting measures have led to tax increases and cuts in jobs, wages, pensions and benefits \u2013 and significant public outcry. The national unemployment rate for January, the latest month for which figures are available, was nearly 22%, prompting widespread protests and leading some young people to leave the country in search of work.  Youth unemployment is even higher than the national average of one in five out of work. For two years, the country\u2019s massive amount of debt has threatened the stability of the 17-country eurozone. Greece pushed through a huge debt swap in March to save it from disorderly default and clear the way for it to receive a second bailout from the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, worth \u20ac130 billion ($171.5 billion). The debt restructuring deal gave some breathing space to the eurozone bloc, where fears that Greece might collapse had increased pressure on other debt-laden nations such as Spain and Italy. The tribulations of New Democracy and PASOK were matched by triumphs of a number of other parties that were also-rans and in some cases nonexistent just a few years ago, propelled by voters angry about stringent austerity measures."

        "content": "Europeans are revolting \u2013 against their leaders and established political parties, against an austerity plan \u2018made in Germany\u2019, and against a future that promises declining living standards and shriveling public services. Within the past few days, Greeks have fled to opposite ends of the spectrum, with significant numbers voting for far-left and far-right parties that were but specks on the political landscape two years ago. The French turfed out the president who wanted to make them more competitive and less indebted \u2013 and voted for a candidate pledged to reversing the recent rise in the retirement age. Two million voters deliberately spoiled their ballot papers after the leader of the far-right National Front said that\u2019s what she would do. In local elections in Britain both parties in the ruling coalition were rebuffed. The left and protest groups did well in Italy\u2019s local elections Monday, with former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s party taking a beating. Comedian Beppe Grillo, who wants Italy to default on its debt, took 21% of the vote in the city of Parma. And in Germany Sunday, Chancellor Angela Merkel was snubbed in a state election \u2013 voters apparently weary of Germany\u2019s hard-earned \u201cfiscal rectitude\u201d being tarnished by those spendthrift Mediterranean types. Even if Europe is financially out of intensive care \u2013 after a series of summits that basically endorsed Germany\u2019s blueprint for the future and sought to stabilize the banking system \u2013 the economic and employment outlook remains grim. In response to popular discontent, the rhetoric is changing: less stress on austerity, more on engineering growth. Hence Merkel\u2019s olive branch to France\u2019s new Socialist President, Francois Hollande: \u201cWe are talking about two sides of the same coin \u2013 progress is only achievable via solid finances plus growth.\u201d But one Merkel ally \u2013 Volker Kauder of the Christian Democrats \u2013 was less tactful. \u201cThere will not be new public programs to boost activity, such as the (opposition) German Social Democrats and Francois Hollande are calling for,\u201d he told a German newspaper. Hollande has vowed not to endorse the European Union\u2019s treaty on fiscal discipline without new growth initiatives. If he means it, the markets won\u2019t like it. Chances are, according to Ian Bremmer of Eurasia Group, that it was fodder for the campaign trail. \u201cHis EU growth agenda means little in actual policy substance,\u201d Bremmer wrote Monday. \u201cA shift in policy rhetoric, which German Chancellor Angela Merkel has already been tacking toward, should prove sufficient to keep relations on track.\u201d So, discard a crisis in Franco-German relations, and look for a vague compromise instead \u2013 plus a guerrilla war on whether the European Central Bank should be in the stimulus business.  Whatever government is formed in Greece, and it will likely be a makeshift coalition, it won\u2019t push Europe into diluting the medicine. The options for whoever takes office in Athens are stark: stay the internationally-prescribed course and receive further support; or go cold turkey and exit the eurozone. The Greek electorate, after seeing their incomes fall (on average) by nearly one-third in three years, are in a foul and volatile mood. And next month, whoever is in power in Athens has to find another $15 billion in spending cuts to keep international creditors happy. This might politely be described as uncharted waters. The old parties of center-left and center-right are short of a parliamentary majority even if they agree to combine, while Golden Dawn, replete with its neo-Nazi symbolism and threatening a war on immigrants, suddenly has 21 deputies. The headline in the Greek newspaper Ta Nea Monday, with no hint of hyperbole: \u201cThe Nightmare of Un-governability.\u201d  Essentially, the European politicians so reviled by the voters have little room to maneuver. Neither Germany nor the financial markets will entertain increased borrowing or backsliding on targets to cut deficits. German proposals for labor reforms to make Europe more competitive are a long-term enterprise. So is chipping away at public debt that has swollen over the past decade and more. In Greece and across much of Europe, younger voters are suffering the highest rates of unemployment and are flocking to the political margins. In the 17 countries of the eurozone more than one-tenth of the labor force is idle, according to the latest statistics from Eurostat. Fifty one percent of Spaniards under 25 are out of work while Italian unemployment hit a 12-year high in March.  Spain\u2019s new Conservative government has intensified spending cuts and is putting pressure on the spendthrift regional governments to get their budgets balanced. In January, the central government had to step in to ensure the city of Valencia could repay a $160 million debt to Deutsche Bank, while Spanish banks have suffered a sharp rise in bad loans, and property prices continue to crumble.  Italy\u2019s situation is similarly parlous. Its technocratic government is trying to identify spending cuts to avert a rise in the top rate of sales tax (known as VAT) to 23%. The government expects the economy to contract 1.2% this year \u2013 hardly the sort of performance that will get people back to work. Writing in the Financial Times last October, former British Prime Minister John Major described a European scenario that seemed like the economic equivalent of Edward Munch\u2019s \u201cThe Scream.\u201d The southern states \u201cmust devalue their living standards and promote reforms to enhance efficiency. This will take years. Meanwhile, wages must fall, unemployment will rise and social unrest will increase. The severity of this medicine may not be bearable in a liberal democracy.\u201d  And when Major was prime minister, he was never one to exaggerate.  "

        "content": "Their Indian owners once talked about pushing Blackburn Rovers into the elite tier of the English Premier League but just 18 months after their takeover, poultry giants Venky\u2019s are contemplating relegation. Monday\u2019s 1-0 home defeat to Wigan Athletic condemned the former Premier League champions to the second tier amid angry scenes at their Ewood Park home. The club\u2019s Scottish manager Steve Kean, who has been subjected to abuse by supporters all season, had to be escorted from the pitch by police as a group of fans invaded the playing surface. After the game Kean insisted he was the man to restore Blackburn\u2019s status, telling the match broadcaster: \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely devastated. The players are numb inside the dressing room.  \u201cWe felt as though we\u2019d done a very good job tonight. It\u2019s a massive setback but we\u2019ll be back to fight another day. \u201cWhat we have to do is regroup. We have to add some established players and we have to look to keep as many of the players together as possible.\u201d Rovers\u2019 relegation marked a stark contrast to the bright optimism that greeted their takeover back in November 2010 by Venky\u2019s, the first Indian owners of a Premier League club. Back then, they talked of finishing in the top four in the division, and linked themselves with high-profile players like Brazil\u2019s World Cup-winning attacker Ronaldinho. But after modest spending and a turbulent season, which also saw their manager banned for drink driving, a late goal from Wigan\u2019s Paraguayan defender Antolin Alcaraz sealed their fate. Upon the final whistle, a group of fans took to the pitch as Kean was bundled off the field by security staff and a handful of police. Others in the stands chanted: \u201cWe want Venky\u2019s out.\u201d Blackburn won their only Premier League title in 1995 but have failed to challenge since. They were relegated in 1999 but bounced back under former Liverpool midfielder Graeme Souness two years later. As for Wigan, victory secured their Premier League status and confounded a legion of critics who had written them off as doomed after they lost eight matches in a row at the start of the season. But a recent run of six wins in eight games, which has seen them beat Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle, has cemented their place in the top flight for another year. Meanwhile in France, Montpellier reclaimed their position at the top of the Ligue 1 from big-spending Paris Saint-Germain after a 2-0 victory at Stade Rennes. A strike from Senegal striker Souleymane Camara was added to by an own goal from Benoit Costil, as Montpellier moved three points clear of PSG with two games remaining. Lille kept up their faint hopes of retaining their crown with a 3-0 win over Caen. Tulio De Melo\u2019s double ensured they ended the evening five points behind Montpellier and two behind PSG. Bordeaux, 2009 champions, won 4-2 at AJ Auxerre, helped by two goals from Yoan Gouffran while S\u00e9bastien Roudet\u2019s goal secured a 1-0 win for Sochaux at home to AS Nancy Lorraine."

        "content": "There is much debate in the world of golf as to whether four-time major winner Phil Mickelson deserves his place in the game\u2019s Hall of Fame, but journalist David Dusek is in no doubt. The deputy editor of Golf.com has told CNN World Sport there should be no doubt Mickelson\u2019s pedigree befits the accolade, calling the 41-year-old one of the best players of his generation. There has been criticism in some quarters that given his age, Mickelson is too young to take his place in the pantheon of greats who have graced the sport despite a 20-year top-level career. Others have pointed to the fact that, incredibly, he has never held the top spot in golf\u2019s world rankings. Fowler finally comes of age with first PGA Tour title But Dusek disagrees and thinks the player \u2013 known affectionately by fans as \u201cLefty\u201d \u2013 still has a few major championships left in the tank. \u201cPhil absolutely deserves to be in the Hall of Fame. He\u2019s one of the great players of his generation,\u201d Dusek said ahead of Mickelson\u2019s induction on Monday. \u201cHe won four major championships in the era when one guy, namely Tiger Woods, won 14 of them. He was well seated at number two in the world for a quite a while. \u201cThe fact that he has been a stalwart of eight Ryder Cup teams, eight Presidents Cup teams, he has 40 (PGA Tour) wins \u2013 all these numbers are Hall of Fame-worthy material.\u201d The debate over Mickelson\u2019s worthiness will be replicated in the coming years, according to Dusek, given that Woods reigned supreme over the game for such a long period. \u201cTiger has skewed things quite a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Tiger Woods wasn\u2019t there Phil and many other players, like Ernie Els, would have won more titles.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to run into several players now that will be Hall of Fame candidates in the next few years who were not number one in the world. \u201cPhil Mickelson is one of the first ones. If you look at the body of work for someone like Mickelson, he definitely gets in. The question mark will come soon. What happens with a player like Jim Furyk or Colin Montgomerie? Bubba Watson: Golf\u2019s new genius superstar?  \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to take into consideration that attaining the world number one ranking from the late 1990s through the late 2000s was going to be very difficult for anyone to do, yet they could be a fantastic golfer and Mickelson fits the bill.\u201d Mickelson was in contention to win a fourth Masters title at Augusta last month, but fell short after a disappointing final round. However, he can still boast one PGA Tour victory this season \u2013 at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am back in February. Dusek believes Mickelson still has the game to challenge for more titles \u2013 and more majors. \u201cMickelson showed on the PGA Tour (at Pebble Beach) that he is capable of playing fantastic golf,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact his putting has been much, much better this season than it has been for a few seasons is a great sign and certainly when he gets back to Augusta next year he could easily go for a fourth Masters. He could have won this year. \u201cI would not be the least bit surprised if Phil Mickelson wins another major title, possibly a few more.\u201d"

        "content": "Romania\u2019s newly appointed government won the approval of parliament Monday, gaining the official right to run the country.  The Cabinet was installed during a ceremony Monday evening. Romania is the latest country in the European Union to welcome a left-leaning government amid austerity fever, corruption and widespread public pressure. The change of power is the result of a fiscal tightening by the former center-right Democratic Liberal government, which led a slow recovery from the economic recession in the past three years. The government was approved with 284 votes, 49 more than the minimum required by the constitution; 92 lawmakers voted against the Cabinet.  \u201cI am honored and proud to have gained your vote today and I hope I will not disappoint you,\u201d said the new prime minister, Victor Ponta, after the results were announced. \u201cI would like to thank my colleagues for voting a Social Democrat prime minister and to assure them I will vote a liberal president, as well.\u201d The former government collapsed at the end of April after a censure motion filed by the opposition won approval in parliament. The new government, an alliance of Social Democrats and liberals, was also backed by the lawmakers representing minorities and by the National Union for the Progress of Romania (UNPR), a center-left party run by a group of independents that struck a deal with Ponta last week. With a Romanian currency dropped to an all-time low against the euro shortly after the former government\u2019s fall, the new Cabinet is expected to maintain the country\u2019s economic stability and continue the reforms within the state-owned companies. One month ahead of local elections, the Cabinet announced its intention to raise salaries in the public sector 15% this year. Fitch Ratings said such populist policies that might result in fiscal slippages could downgrade Romania this year. However, Finance Minister Florin Georgescu said the Cabinet is able to restore public wages without affecting financial stability because they had been cut by the former government in 2010 as part of a series of austerity measures. Romanian President Traian Basescu said on Sunday that he supports restoring public wages to pre-austerity levels as long as the measures respect a deal reached with the International Monetary Fund. After the government\u2019s downfall, the IMF, the European Commission and the World Bank had suspended discussions with Romania until the new government was officially installed. Ponta met on Monday with IMF representatives to assure them that Romania is stable and can fulfill its obligations. He also said it is in Romania\u2019s interest that the IMF representatives leave the country with a new letter of intent signed by the new Cabinet. The letter, stating Romania\u2019s commitment to stick to the IMF deal, is expected to be debated and approved on Tuesday, in the government\u2019s first meeting. The IMF representatives recently began an official visit to Romania to review the country\u2019s financial situation. This follows a \u20ac5 billion ($6.5 billion) loan granted last year to prevent fiscal instability. Romania aims to cut its budget deficit to 2.25% of GDP this year, from 5.2% in 2011.  The new government\u2019s priorities also include better absorption of EU funds, as Romania has the lowest absorption rate of funds in the European Union. The Cabinet has promised to crack down on corruption and political appointments in the public institutions, and to create new jobs. Romania\u2019s political turmoil was aggravated recently after a wave of resignations in the ruling coalition, represented by the Democrat Liberal Party, the ethnic Hungarians and the minority groups. Mihai Razvan Ungureanu resigned as prime minister in April after only 78 days in office following the censure motion.  \u201cThey betrayed us and voted for the motion,\u201d Democrat Liberal leader Emil Boc said of the minorities.  Shortly after the announcement, Basescu made Ponta his appointee for prime minister.  Ponta, 39, entered politics in 2001 and was elected as a minister twice, in 2004 and in 2008, before becoming leader of the Social Democrat party in 2010.  Romania, the European Union\u2019s second poorest country, had to undertake drastic measures to pay for a loan of more than \u20ac20 billion ($26 billion)  from the IMF, World Bank and EU in 2009. Among them was a  25% wage cut in the public sector. The cuts proved unbearable for Romanians, and thousands around the country protested in January against the Cabinet and Basescu, and toppled the government let by Boc, Ungureanu\u2019s predecessor.  The new Cabinet is expected to stay in power until November, when Romania will have parliamentary elections that will mark the third change in government this year."

        "content": "With four different drivers winning each of the four races so far, 2012 is shaping up as one of the most open seasons in Formula One history. And with no clear favorite yet to emerge, Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg says his team is in a strong position to finally end a long title wait. The German marque has won only one race since returning to the elite division of motorsport in 2010 after an absence of half a century away, but Rosberg has hopes of emulating the 1954-55 world championship successes of legendary racer Juan Manuel Fangio. The 26-year-old\u2019s win at the China Grand Prix last month was Mercedes\u2019 first since Fangio\u2019s victory in Italy in 1955, and his first in 111 career starts.  \u201cBefore China we were really struggling in races and we worked hard and improved the car, modified the set up quite a lot with the car,\u201d Rosberg told CNN ahead of this weekend\u2019s Spanish Grand Prix. \u201cWe\u2019re not the best yet, which is what we want to be soon, but we\u2019re getting there and we were the best in China.  \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult season also, everybody is a little bit up and down this year. In the championship I\u2019m in a really good position. We really need to focus and improve the car step by step and try and get the most out of it and try and get ahead of the others.\u201d The most open F1 season came in 1982 when at least 11 different drivers stood on top of the podium. But even then, Alain Prost of Renault won the first two races. Rosberg believes Mercedes is in a strong position to overcome the disappointments of the past two seasons. \u201cThe team is just doing a much better job, they\u2019re working together better. There\u2019s even more competence now in the team. New people have joined and we\u2019re getting there and we\u2019re really growing quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s taken longer for us and been more difficult than expected. But now we\u2019re really on a roll and going in the right direction, and for everybody China was a very emotional moment.\u201d Rosberg\u2019s veteran teammate Michael Schumacher has blamed F1\u2019s sole tire supplier Pirelli for the unpredictable results in 2012, but the younger German is keen to see the positives in an open season and said the difficult conditions at last month\u2019s Bahrain Grand Prix were a great learning experience. The hot Middle Eastern country took its toll on tires, with McLaren\u2019s former world champion Jenson Button suffering a puncture and retiring on the penultimate lap. His teammate Lewis Hamilton finished eighth, losing his championship lead to Red Bull\u2019s Sebastian Vettel. Rosberg finished fifth after failing to repeat his China pace, and 43-year-old Schumacher was 10th after fighting his way up from the bottom of the grid. \u201cBahrain was probably the toughest conditions tire-wise we\u2019ve had until now and there we were beating teams like McLaren, who until then had been dominating the season,\u201d Rosberg said.  Mercedes, meanwhile, has downplayed reports it could be set to quit F1.  British newspaper The Times claimed the UK-based team could be forced out over a power dispute arising from F1\u2019s proposed stock exchange flotation. It said Mercedes would miss out on a boardroom place despite its large investment as an engine manufacturer in the past two decades, while rival teams Red Bull, Ferrari and McLaren would all be given representation by F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone.  However a Mercedes spokesman told CNN: \u201cWe are in discussions with the commercial rights holder and we would like to ask for your understanding that we are not currently commenting on these discussions.\u201d"

        "content": "Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher has continued to pillory Pirelli\u2019s tires, complaining that they are like driving on \u201craw eggs.\u201d The Mercedes driver blamed the quicker degradation of the Italian manufacturer\u2019s products for the scenario which has seen four race winners in as many starts this season, and much closer competition between the drivers.  \u201cI just think that they\u2019re playing a much too big effect because they are so peaky and so special that they don\u2019t put our cars or ourselves to the limit,\u201d he told CNN ahead of this weekend\u2019s Spanish Grand Prix. \u201cWe drive like on raw eggs and I don\u2019t want to stress the tires at all. Otherwise you just overdo it and you go nowhere.\u201d  The 43-year-old German has been a vocal critic of Pirelli, calling on the company to rethink its approach after several drivers struggled with tire degradation during last month\u2019s Bahrain Grand Prix. He was backed by McLaren team boss Martin Whitmarsh, whose drivers also struggled with the tires. Jenson Button suffered a puncture with three laps remaining, retiring on the penultimate lap, while Lewis Hamilton finished down in eighth and lost his championship lead to race winner Sebastian Vettel. Pirelli replaced Bridgestone as F1\u2019s sole tire supplier in 2011, winning a three-year contract. Bridgestone had been the sole provider from 2007-2010, after Michelin pulled out. However, Pirelli has argued it should be congratulated for such an open, unpredictable season. The manufacturer claimed it was simply responding to calls for more eventful racing, with director Paul Hembery saying: \u201cWe are pushing the limits. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very aggressive approach that we took. It\u2019s what we were asked to do. We were asked to bring challenges to the teams and this is what we\u2019ve done.\u201d Schumacher\u2019s teammate Nico Rosberg, however, had a very different view on the tires. The 26-year-old German, who won the Chinese Grand Prix last month for his first victory in 111 attempts, took a positive spin on the unpredictability. \u201cI find it a big challenge for us drivers and an interesting challenge.  It\u2019s different but very interesting,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThis tire management, getting the most out of it, understanding when to push, when to take it easy.  It\u2019s so on a knife\u2019s edge with the tires that it\u2019s good and it\u2019s great for racing. It\u2019s great, it\u2019s mixed everything up, lots of overtaking, lots of things happening, fantastic for everybody.\u201d While Rosberg is sixth in the drivers\u2019 rankings, Schumacher is languishing in 18th as he seeks his first podium placing since coming out of retirement in 2010. However, the former Ferrari star is proud to see younger compatriots such as Rosberg, Nico Hulkenberg of Force India and Marussia\u2019s Timo Glock with him on the 24-strong grid this season, and he reserved special praise for Red Bull\u2019s double world champion Vettel. \u201cBeing good friends, particularly with Sebastian, sort of makes it even more special because he grew up on my go-kart track,\u201d Schumacher said.  \u201cWe know each other from childhood. His childhood mainly \u2013 I was a little bit grown up by that stage. And seeing him do well makes me proud.\u201d The Mercedes cars have been a lot more competitive this season, and Schumacher hopes they can transform their improved pace with more consistent race results. \u201cWe have got one win under our belt. Got a bit unlucky in that race \u2013 could have been a one-two without a doubt \u2013 but it proves that we made a huge step because we have to consider where we come from,\u201d he said.  \u201cLast year wasn\u2019t really what we were looking for. Starting the Silver Arrow new generation we had media success and finally we managed a victory, and I\u2019m pretty sure we can have other good races this year being on the podium, and maybe even being on top of the podium.\u201d"

In a dominant display, Kvitova hit 28 winners and five aces, breaking Erakovic five times in the match. Is blue the new red?

After her win Williams told reporters the tournament\u2019s blue surface, which has attracted complaints from the world\u2019s top male players including Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, caused her no trouble. \u201cI haven\u2019t noticed a difference between the blue and the red clay.

        "content": "The election of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande as president of France sent shock waves through markets in Asia and Europe on Monday and prompted German Chancellor Angela Merkel to lay down red lines about Europe\u2019s future. In his victory speech Sunday night, Hollande signaled a possible end to the sharp budget cuts that have become a European article of faith in response to economic and budget crises across the continent. \u201cAusterity can no longer be something that is inevitable,\u201d Hollande said after defeating President Nicolas Sarkozy. Sarkozy must hand over power by midnight May 15, Hollande spokesman Pierre Moscovici said. Merkel said Monday that she is in favor of economic growth but that it cannot be based on government debt.  \u201cThe core of the discussion is about whether we are going to have programs for growth that are on the back of debt or programs for growth that are going to be sustainable,\u201d she said. Her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said earlier Monday that it is \u201cnot possible\u201d to renegotiate the European Union fiscal pact. The deal, championed by Merkel and Sarkozy, demands that EU governments stay within strict debt limits. Merkel invited Hollande to Berlin \u201cas soon as possible after he is sworn in\u201d and said she would welcome him with \u201copen arms,\u201d Seibert said. \u201cBoth agree on how important tight German-French relations are and have assured one another that they\u2019ll strive to work together well and with trust,\u201d Seibert said on the chancellor\u2019s website. Hollande will visit Berlin shortly after he takes office, Moscovici said. Markets in Europe closed mostly flat after a morning dip in the wake of Hollande\u2019s election. France\u2019s CAC 40 closed up 1.8% after slipping an identical amount in early trading. Germany\u2019s DAX closed off 0.1% after early losses of as much as 2.3%. After being closed Friday for a holiday, the Nikkei index in Tokyo fell 2.8% on concerns about European debt and Friday\u2019s weaker-than-expected jobs report in the United States. The Shangai Composite closed flat after initially falling more than 2%. U.S. stocks were mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial down a fraction of a percent and the Nasdaq up a fraction in early afternoon trading. Hollande officially won 51.62% of the vote Sunday, while Sarkozy took 48.38%. The vote was a runoff between the two top finishers of the first round of elections in April.  A little more than 80% of registered voters cast ballots Sunday, including 4.66% who handed in blank ballot papers, the Interior Ministry said. Speaking to supporters Sunday in the city of Tulle, Hollande alluded to becoming the first Socialist president since Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand left office in 1995. \u201cMany people have been waiting for this moment for many long years. Others, younger, have never known such a time. \u2026 I am proud to be capable to bring about hope again,\u201d he told the cheering crowd. Later, Hollande went to Paris, where he addressed a large crowd at the Bastille. Supporters waved flags and shouted his name. \u201cI know what many people feel \u2013 years and years of wounds, of ruptures, and we have to repair, recover, unite. That is what we\u2019re going to do together,\u201d he vowed. Crowds roared at the center-left candidate\u2019s campaign headquarters as the exit poll results came out Sunday evening. Celebratory car horns blared along the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris. \u201cIt\u2019s a great night, full of joy for so many young people all across the country,\u201d said Thierry Marchal-Beck, president of the Movement of Young Socialists. U.S. President Barack Obama called Hollande shortly after results were in to congratulate him and invite him to the White House. Sarkozy had fought to keep his job amid a wave of discontent over his inability to rein in unemployment. He defended his economic record despite low growth and unemployment at about 10%, saying the impact of Europe\u2019s debt crisis could have been far worse. France is a key player in plans to lead the eurozone out of its debt crisis.   Sarkozy\u2019s defeat marks the latest \u2013 and most significant \u2013 of more than half a dozen European leaders swept from office during the eurozone economic crisis, including the Greek and Italian prime ministers. France\u2019s vote came the same day as the Greek parliamentary election. Greece\u2019s ruling coalition suffered steep losses, while parties on the far left and far right made significant gains amid anger over austerity measures. Sarkozy has been president since 2007. He becomes the first sitting French president in three decades not to be re-elected."

        "content": "Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the newly-inaugurated President of France, may be as notable for what he has not done as for what he has.  He has never held national elective office despite being at the center of  French politics for more than a decade, and he has never been married despite a three-decade relationship and four children with S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royale, another of the country\u2019s top Socialist politicians. Hollande led the Socialist Party for 11 years and was leader when Royale ran unsuccessfully for president against Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007.  Hollande and Royale split up a month before that election, and he is now seeing journalist Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, who appeared, smiling with him, as he celebrated his victory Sunday. He immediately spooked markets, and Germany, France\u2019s key ally in the European Union, with his victory speech. \u201cAusterity can no longer be something that is inevitable,\u201d he said, apparently undercutting the belt-tightening that his predecessor and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have urged on European countries beset by debt. Hollande emerged as his party\u2019s candidate for president after the downfall of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who was once considered the Socialist favorite to defeat Sarkozy.  But Strauss-Kahn was arrested in May 2011 after a New York hotel maid alleged that he tried to rape her. Charges against the former IMF chief were later dropped in the United States, but he has been warned he could be investigated in France over accusations he participated in a prostitution ring.  But Hollande was not an accidental candidate despite the way he has come to power, one commentator said. \u201cHe\u2019s been preparing this campaign for 18 months now, much before DSK\u2019s demise,\u201d journalist Agn\u00e8s Poirier said, referring to Strauss-Kahn.  \u201cSome say that he knew, like actually many others in the party, that DSK was doomed: His colorful private life was always bound to prevent his running for president,\u201d Poirer told CNN before the final vote.  \u201cIn that respect, he\u2019s not a candidate by default. He\u2019s simply a less charismatic personality than DSK and less antagonistic than Sarkozy.\u201d Born in 1954 in the northern city of Rouen, Hollande was the son of a doctor and a social worker. He was educated at the elite Ecole Nationale d\u2019Administration, where he met Royale in 1978.  Hollande has represented the southern Corr\u00e8ze region in parliament since 1988 but has never held higher elective office than that post. The 57-year-old\u2019s electoral appeal is built around his affability, but the candidate was dogged during the campaign by questions from even within his own party about whether he has the charisma and decisiveness to be president. Hollande said: \u201cThere\u2019s always a risk when the candidate becomes president: Will he deliver what is expected of him?  \u201cIt\u2019s a choice, it\u2019s always an important moment for a country because it has to choose between two risks: Either you keep the candidate who is on his way out or take the new candidate that we don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a gamble.\u201d  But after five years of Sarkozy\u2019s hyperactive presidency, during which time France\u2019s economic status has taken a knock, polls suggested voters were keen for a change from the president\u2019s flamboyancy.  Before the first round of voting, former President Jacques Chirac added his support to Hollande, though Chirac was a center-right president, like Sarkozy. Chirac biographer Jean-Luc Barr\u00e9 told French TV channel BFM TV: \u201cHe said last June that he will vote for Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. \u2026 He has said it a few times since and then again 10 days ago.\u201d During the campaign, Hollande admitted that half of those who declare they will vote for him were primarily voting against Sarkozy. \u201cWhat the French want is coherence, stability and justice,\u201d Hollande said. \u201cIf I am in a favorable position today, it\u2019s because my fellow citizens want to make the effort to straighten out the country, and at the same time they want it to be just and equitable \u2013 no one left out of national solidarity and no one left out of the contributions which must be made.\u201d  To his critics that sounded as if Hollande wants to revive left-wing tax and social policies of the past, a view reinforced in the first speech of his campaign when he attacked the financial community. \u201cI don\u2019t want to drive the markets crazy, I don\u2019t want to create trouble but rather order and rules and norms. We have to struggle against financial excesses \u2026 those who speculate with sovereign debt, those who develop financial products which have done so much harm,\u201d he said. But given the constraints of international finance and economic structures, observers said Hollande will not really have room to maneuver to shift France radically to the left.  Hollande has been criticized for declining to spell exactly what his economic policies will be, although he has pledged to increase taxes on the rich, boost social spending and create thousands of state jobs. He has also vowed to renegotiate the eurozone fiscal agreement, but analysts said Hollande will likely be a pragmatic leader. Economy: Unspoken issue in election The word one hears most often to describe Hollande\u2019s style is \u201csympa,\u201d French slang for sympathetic, but his victory also owes a great deal to Strauss-Kahn\u2019s misfortune."

        "content": "A piece of rock legend Jimi Hendrix\u2019s guitar, teak from China, a salad server and a plank of wood from a newly constructed London Olympic venue. Each item of this unusual collection of materials has its own unique history and now they have been put together to create a new sailing boat.  The 30-foot yacht launched Monday in Emsworth, Hampshire on England\u2019s southern coast, is made up of hundreds of precious items which have been donated by people across the country\u2019s south-east.  \u2018The Boat Project\u2019 is a part of the region\u2019s contribution to the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad, which bills itself as the largest cultural celebration in Olympic history. \u201cMany people don\u2019t get to be exposed to the Games unless they have a ticket to an event,\u201d says boat builder Mark Covell. \u201cThis gives more people the chance to be a part of the celebrations and the cultural history of the Olympics.\u201d Covell knows firsthand the thrill of being part of the Games \u2013 having won a silver medal in Sydney in 2000. The Olympian has been involved in the project from the beginning. It\u2019s been two years in the making and Covell compares the scale of the project with his own Olympic preparations. \u201cIt was an enormous task,\u201d explains Covell. \u201cYou needed to go above and beyond.\u201d  In all 1221 wooden objects were donated, and every single one has gone into the construction of the vessel. They range from treasures people have come across over the years in their travels to family heirlooms. The result is a yacht that is not only unique in her make up, but also in her sailing capabilities, says Mike Barham, who will captain the yacht. \u201cShe\u2019s much faster than a normal 30 ft yacht,\u201d he explains. \u201cShe\u2019s a cross between a high performance dingy and a high performance sailing boat.\u201d The donated items were collected over six months by organizers who visited 20 locations across south east England. Once laid out, the goods filled an entire carpark. \u201cThe amount of precious things that were given has been really inspiring,\u201d says Covell. Steve Ashmore is one of the hundreds who donated goods. The graphic designer contributed a piece of wood from a block of wood known as a tro, which was used by fisherman to haul their fish up the beach in Hastings, in south-east England. \u201cI wanted to give something from the place I was from,\u201d he explained.  Ashmore is in a unique position, not only has he helped in the physical make up of the boat, but he\u2019s also a part of the crew of volunteers for the boat\u2019s maiden voyage, all of whom have been nominated by their friends and family. \u201cI want the voyage to do the whole project justice,\u201d the novice sailor says. \u201cSo many people have put time, creativity and love into it.\u201d The crew have been in training in recent weeks for their maiden voyage which will take them around the south east region. It will finish up at the London 2012 Olympic venue in Weymouth, Dorset in August, where it will remain on display throughout the Games. Even without taking to the water Covell says \u2018The Boat Project\u2019 has embodied the spirit of the Olympics. \u201cIt\u2019s been the community who\u2019ve donated their items and a community of volunteers who\u2019ve built her and will sail her,\u201d Covell says. \u201cAnd bringing the community together is an Olympic ideal.\u201d"

        "content": "Greece\u2019s main center-right party has failed to form a coalition government Monday, adding yet more uncertainty to the debt-ridden country\u2019s political situation. New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras said he did \u201ceverything possible\u201d to form a coalition, but that none of the parties agreed to join with his party, which won first crack at forming a government after finishing first in Sunday\u2019s parliamentary elections. It will now be up to the leftist Syriza coalition, which opposes unpopular austerity measures imposed to secure a European bailout, to form a government. That group will have three days to form a government. Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras left little doubt Sunday about what direction his party would take in a new government. \u201cEuropean leadership and especially (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel have to understand that austerity policies have suffered defeat,\u201d Tsipras said Sunday.  He called the election results \u201ca message of a peaceful revolution.\u201d Sunday\u2019s election results were widely seen as a message to politicians to back away from the harsh economic austerity measures imposed in Greece. A European Commission spokeswoman said Monday that Greece needs time to work through its political process but reminded the country\u2019s leaders that they would be expected to abide by terms of a bailout program meant to avoid a crippling financial meltdown. \u201cThe commission hopes and expects that the future government of Greece will respect the engagements that Greece has entered into,\u201d spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen told reporters. The center-right New Democracy party finished first in Sunday\u2019s voting, but with just 19% of the vote, giving it 108 seats in Greece\u2019s 300-seat parliament. Voters also delivered a rebuke to PASOK \u2013 New Democracy\u2019s socialist partner in the outgoing coalition government \u2013 stripping the party of 119 seats. Together, the parties fell short of the 50% necessary to continue the coalition, requiring formation of a new government. \u201cI asked for a strong mandate, but people chose differently. I respect their message,\u201d Samaras said Sunday on state television. \u201cToday\u2019s result expresses people\u2019s disappointment toward the implemented dead-end economic policy that tested their limits and didn\u2019t include the necessary development policy.\u201d PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos said after meeting with Samaras that his party would be willing to participate, but only in a coalition with a friendly view toward Europe led by a prime minister willing to renegotiate terms of the bailout deal with the European Commission. Last year, Greece\u2019s debt threatened to force it to drop Europe\u2019s common currency, the euro, prompting the European Central Bank and other lenders to swoop in with emergency funding. In exchange, they demanded that the government slash spending. The resulting measures have led to tax increases and cuts in jobs, wages, pensions and benefits \u2013 and significant public outcry. The national unemployment rate for January, the latest month for which figures are available, was nearly 22%, prompting widespread protests and leading some young people to leave the country in search of work. Furthermore, for the past two years, the country\u2019s massive amount of debt has threatened the stability of the 17-country eurozone. Greece pushed through a huge debt swap in March to save it from disorderly default and clear the way for it to receive a second bailout from the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, worth \u20ac130 billion ($171.5 billion). The debt restructuring deal gave some breathing space to the eurozone bloc, where fears that Greece might collapse had increased pressure on other debt-laden nations such as Spain and Italy. The Greek stock market was down about 6% Monday as concerns that Sunday\u2019s election could prompt Greek leaders to reconsider the deal resonated throughout Europe. Hansen, the European Commission spokeswoman, said Greece needs time to form a government and said the commission stands ready to continue its assistance. But she said it would need to be within the framework of the second bailout. Politicians have until May 17 to come up with a new working alliance or, if they cannot, set a date for another round of elections.  Before New Democracy\u2019s failure to form a coalition, Samaras said his party\u2019s two priorities would be to remain in the eurozone and alter existing policies, including stringent austerity measures, to \u201cachieve development and offer people relief.\u201d \u201cI understand people\u2019s rage, but I will not let the country (exist) without a government,\u201d Samaras said. PASOK\u2019s Venizelos said he favors the formation of a unity government that is \u201cEU-oriented, regardless of what their take is\u201d on previously implemented measures. His party will have 41 seats in parliament, down from 160 before the elections. The tribulations of New Democracy and PASOK were matched by triumphs of a number of other parties that were also-rans and in some cases nonexistent just a few years ago, propelled by voters angry about stringent austerity measures. Elections in Europe: Socialist wins French presidency The radical leftist coalition Syriza passed PASOK with a strong second-place showing. Exit polls predicted it would garner 10% support, but instead Syriza garnered 16.7%, according to the results. That more than triples its parliamentary representation to 51 seats. The fourth-place finisher, the Independent Greek party, was founded in February by ousted New Democracy member of parliament Panos Kammenos. With 10.6% backing, this right-wing nationalist party, which opposes Greece\u2019s agreement with the European Union and International Monetary Fund, will now have 33 seats in parliament. The Communist Party, which wants Greece to leave the single-currency eurozone, also saw gains in winning 8.5% support. And the far-right Golden Dawn party, which got 0.3% of votes in the previous election, ended up with 7% support on Sunday. That equates to a rise from zero to 21 parliamentary seats. Its leader, Nikos Michaloliakos, gave a rousing speech after Sunday\u2019s vote, saying Golden Dawn will \u201cfight so that Greece won\u2019t be a slave of the memorandum and of the social jungle that illegal immigrants have brought in this country.\u201d \u201cEveryone who betrays Hellenism should be afraid. We are coming,\u201d he said. Katerina Sokou, financial editor of the Greek daily newspaper Kathimerini, called what happened Sunday \u201ca protest vote (against) the main two political parties of Greece.\u201d Yet Sokou added that she expects New Democracy and PASOK again will be part of the ruling coalition government, even though there may be notable policy changes and challenges to come, including a \u201crenegotiation\u201d of the already approved austerity measures. \u201cI believe that these electoral results \u2026 show that people need a coalition government,\u201d she said. \u201cThey also want the parties to cooperate.\u201d"

        "content": "The calm and cautious Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who dramatically wrested the French presidency from Nicolas Sarkozy on Sunday, faces immediate foreign policy challenges, analysts say. Hollande strides onto the world stage with major events over upcoming days and weeks \u2013 the Group of Eight meeting at Camp David, Maryland, and the NATO summit this month and a G-20 meeting set for Mexico City, and a European Council meeting in Brussels, Belgium, in June.  French journalist and political analyst Agn\u00e8s Poirer said Hollande must meet President Barack Obama in Washington on May 17. She said in a CNN commentary that the \u201ctwo men have never met and Hollande is an unknown entity in the U.S.\u201d The rule of thumb about judging the effectiveness of a president after his or her first 100 days in office could be changed to the first \u201c100 hours\u201d in Hollande\u2019s case, said Heather Conley, senior fellow and director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 Europe Program. In a brief amount of time, Conley said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to get important insights on French directions.\u201d Hollande became France\u2019s first Socialist president since Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand left office in 1995 as he swept to election victory over the incumbent Sarkozy, one of the most America-friendly French presidents in decades.  The result is likely to reverberate across economically hard-hit Europe. Hollande has been critical of the austerity policies central to European bailout deals for troubled economies there. But his leadership is expected to make an impact in Afghanistan as well as Turkey and the Middle East. European markets quickly recovered from an earlier sell-off Monday following national elections in France as well as Greece that sparked concern about the future of planned austerity measures. U.S. stocks were mixed Monday amid reignited concerns about Europe following the elections in France and Greece. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 32 points, or 0.2%, the S&P 500 shed 1 point, or 0.1%, while the Nasdaq composite rose 2 points, or 0.1%. \u201cA change in leadership brings uncertainty because you don\u2019t know exactly what you\u2019re getting into,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer\u2019s Investment Research.  \u201cNew leadership in France could cause investor jitters that reverberate through global financial markets.\u201d Stephen Flanagan, the Henry A. Kissinger chair in diplomacy and national security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, underscored the sense of uncertainty. Hollande doesn\u2019t have a \u201cbig foreign policy track record,\u201d he said. \u201cHollande has been mostly a party functionary,\u201d he said. Danielle Pletka and Gary J. Schmitt of the American Enterprise Institute wrote that Hollande\u2019s \u201ccampaign stayed away from talking about foreign policy almost altogether.\u201d Only four points of Hollande\u2019s 60-point agenda \u201ctouch on foreign affairs,\u201d they said.  \u201cContrary to those who believe Sarko was the George Bush of France (\u2018dragging\u2019 Obama into Libya, taking a hard line on Iran\u2019s nuclear program), and have hopes that the long-time head of the French Socialist Party will take a severe turn to the left, Hollande is likely to disappoint,\u201d they said. Flanagan doesn\u2019t see Hollande as being anti-American or a \u201cdifficult ally.\u201d \u201cI think he\u2019s going to be a little bit more cautious and circumspect about international intervention,\u201d Flanagan said.  With Sarkozy, the United States enjoyed support in its positions on Syria, Iran and Afghanistan. Sarkozy was a proponent of the NATO air campaign in Libya, but Flanagan said he\u2019s \u201cnot sure Hollande would have led the charge into Libya.\u201d Pletka and Schmitt wrote Hollande hasn\u2019t tried to \u201cdistance himself from his predecessor\u2019s intervention in Libya or his relatively hawkish policies toward Syria and Iran.\u201d  \u201cThe one policy change Hollande is specifically committed to (and which will be most noticed by conservatives in Washington) is his pledge to withdraw all French combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of the year,\u201d they said, \u201cThis is not a radical departure from Sarkozy, who had already pledged to bring those troops home in 2013, a full year ahead of the alliance\u2019s agreement to stay until 2014.\u201d During the campaign, Hollande also raised questions about Sarkozy\u2019s decision in 2009 to place French troops under NATO command.  Hollande can expect NATO leaders to urge him to change or soften his position when he attends the NATO summit in Chicago this month where the focus will be on Afghanistan.  But if Hollande commits to disengaging troops without a reasonable transition, \u201cit\u2019ll make a very bad first impression with his NATO allies,\u201d Flanagan said. Flanagan said relations between Turkey and France have been tense because Sarkozy was \u201cdead set\u201d against Turkey becoming a member of the European Union. He said Turks also viewed Sarkozy as supportive of legislation making the denial of the Armenian genocide a crime, a stance they vehemently opposed. Hollande is expected to be a bit more open-minded on Turkey, Flanagan said. Marc Pierini, a former European Union career diplomat, wrote in a commentary for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace that France also needs a \u201cfresh start\u201d in the Arab world.  \u201cHollande will now have to rebuild decent relations with largely unknown political partners \u2013 Islamists now dominate the political game in Egypt and Tunisia for example. He will also need to work with the Arab world more through the EU framework, rather than through a strictly bilateral one, which his predecessor preferred but did not work,\u201d he said. Pierini wrote that Hollande\u2019s \u201cstrongest cards\u201d are his \u201ccalm, polite demeanor\u201d and the \u201clegitimacy deriving from his victory.\u201d Pletka and Schmitt wrote \u201cthe dry and cautious Hollande appears almost certain to pursue a dry and cautious presidency.\u201d"

        "content": "Vladimir Putin, who has dominated Russian politics for more than a decade, was sworn in Monday as the country\u2019s president two months after winning back the job in an election clouded by allegations of widespread fraud. \u201cWe\u2019re entering a new stage in our national development,\u201d Putin said in his inauguration speech. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to address tasks that are of a totally different level and scale. The next few years will define the future of Russia for decades ahead.\u201d About 2,000 people attended the inauguration under tight security, while nearby, police arrested about 120 people protesting against the return of Putin to the presidency, according to the state-run Ria Novosti news service. Putin held the presidency for eight years before term limits forced him to step down in 2008. He then became prime minister under his hand-picked successor, Dmitry Medvedev. One of Putin\u2019s first tasks was to nominate Medvedev to become prime minister, according to Ria Novosti. Putin, a former KGB officer who has worked to stabilize Russia\u2019s economy and curtail dissent, won the March presidential election with nearly 65% of the vote. International observers said there was legitimate uncertainty about the vote, and chess champion-turned-opposition activist Garry Kasparov accused Putin\u2019s supporters of \u201cmassive fraud.\u201d Under Russia\u2019s newly amended constitution, Putin will serve a six-year term and, if re-elected, could remain in power until 2024 \u2013 the longest of any Russian leader since Joseph Stalin, according to Ria Novosti. On Sunday, hundreds of people, including opposition leaders and a popular blogger, were arrested in anti-Putin protests. Many chanted slogans such as \u201cRussia without Putin\u201d and \u201cPutin is a thief.\u201d The protest turned violent when a large number of demonstrators veered off the agreed route of the march, and some protesters fought with police. Clashes broke out, with some protesters throwing objects \u2013 including sticks and at least one flare \u2013 at police. Authorities responded by \u201cclubbing demonstrators\u201d who briefly broke through police lines, the RIA Novosti news agency reported.  One of its correspondents saw \u201ca male protester out cold after clashing with officers,\u201d while another reported eight officers arresting one demonstrator \u201cfor the apparent crime of wearing a Guy Fawkes mask,\u201d the symbol of the vigilante hacking group Anonymous. More than 250 people were arrested, including leading opposition figure Boris Nemtsov, leftist radical group leader Sergei Udaltsov and popular blogger Alexei Navalny, Moscow police said. Twenty officers were injured and three hospitalized in the clashes, according to RIA Novosti."

        "content": "When Rickie Fowler was named the PGA Tour\u2019s rookie of the year in 2010, the groundswell of opinion outside the U.S. was that the award should have gone to another young golfing prodigy \u2013 Rory McIlroy. While the Northern Irishman went on to win his first major title in 2011, and climbed to the top of the world rankings this year, Fowler had been hanging on the cusp of his own breakthrough. Until Sunday, that is, when the 23-year-old claimed his first PGA Tour title at the same Quail Hollow venue where McIlroy made his mark two years ago with a stunning final-round 62 that secured his maiden U.S. victory. Clad in his trademark bright orange outfit, his shock of hair barely contained by his hat, and a mustache nestling above his top lip that any 1970s detective would be proud of, Fowler produced his own moment of magic to beat McIlroy and fellow American D.A. Points in a playoff at the Wells Fargo Championship. Woods misses halfway cut at Quail Hollow His stunning wedge shot to within four feet of the hole at the tricky 18th, which had given up only four birdies all day, earned him the $1.17 million first prize and lifted him to 15th in the FedEx Cup standings and 24th in the world rankings. \u201cFor Rickie to go out and play that hole the way he did, he deserved to win,\u201d said McIlroy, who returned to world No. 1 above Englishman Luke Donald after taking home $572,000 in consolation. \u201cHe probably has gone through a little bit of sort of scrutiny and a lot of pressure trying to get that first win, but now that win is out of the way. Hopefully that\u2019ll ease the pressure a little bit.\u201d Fowler, who was the world\u2019s top amateur for 36 weeks, lost a playoff in his second tournament as a professional and has been runner-up three times on the main U.S. tour. Rested McIlroy returns to PGA Tour \u201cIt\u2019s nice to kind of shut them up a little bit,\u201d he said on the PGA Tour website. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be kind of a relief. It\u2019s been a wait, but I\u2019m definitely still young, and hopefully this opens the door to many more. But it\u2019s nice to be mentioned as a PGA Tour winner.  \u201cIt\u2019s still going to be almost like having zero when someone like Phil (Mickelson) is getting announced with 40 and I\u2019ve got one. I\u2019ve got some work to do.\u201d When Fowler lines up at this week\u2019s prestigious Players Championship, he will again be playing without one of his closest golfing friends \u2013 Masters champion Bubba Watson, who skipped Quail Hollow to be with his wife and newly-adopted son and has also decided to sit out golf\u2019s \u201cfifth major.\u201d Final leaderboard at Wells Fargo Championship Watson and Fowler make up half of golf\u2019s only boy band, the Golf Boys, along with Ben Crane and FedEx Cup leader Hunter Mahan. \u201cI\u2019m bummed that Bubba wasn\u2019t around,\u201d said Fowler, who helped Watson celebrate after his Masters playoff victory in April. \u201cWe weren\u2019t exactly inside the ropes but we had a front-row seat, and just to see how he handled himself, the shots he hit, just to feel the energy \u2026 definitely being around there gave me the kind of want to win more.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time Fowler has beaten McIlroy \u2013 he did so by six shots in his only other professional win in a Korean event last year. \u201cRory is the top-ranked young player right now, I\u2019m probably the one that sticks out most with color,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cNow I\u2019m a PGA Tour winner, so I\u2019ve got some credibility.\u201d Fowler played in the 2010 Ryder Cup defeat against Europe, and Sunday\u2019s victory has lifted his hopes of playing in the U.S. team for this year\u2019s match in Medinah, Illinois. Meanwhile, another player who made his Ryder Cup debut two years ago, Francesco Molinari, boosted his chance of a second appearance in September by winning the European Tour\u2019s Spanish Open on Sunday. The Italian, whose brother Edoardo halved with Fowler in singles play at Celtic Manor in 2010, moved up to 10th place on the European Ryder Cup standings after winning by three shots in Seville. The 29-year-old took home \u20ac333,330 ($435,000) after clinching his first title in 18 months, and climbed to 29th in the world rankings."

        "content": "Serbian President Boris Tadic and his challenger Tomislav Nikolic were heading for a run-off with initial results showing Tadic and his Democratic party slightly ahead in presidential and parliamentary elections. The elections are the first since the overthrow of strongman president Slobodan Milosevic in 2000 in which both leading presidential candidates and party blocs claim to support Serbia\u2019s integration into the European Union. The country seemed set for a continuation of a moderate, pro-European coalition after both the first official results and exit polls showed Tadic\u2019s party gaining about 25% of the vote, about 1 percentage point ahead of Nikolic\u2019s right-wing Progressive party. In the presidential poll, initial figures gave Tadic 26 per cent, also a point or so ahead of Nikolic. With neither candidate passing the 50 per cent barrier \u2013 in a field of 12 candidates \u2013 the two will go into a second round on May 20. Nikolic\u2019s Progressives challenged the initial projections, however, claiming their own polling showed they had a narrow lead. Some analysts question the depth of the pro-European conversion of Nikolic, former right-hand man to Vojislav Seselj, now on trial for alleged war crimes in The Hague, in the nationalist Radical Party. Tadic\u2019s rival Democratic party has also run a campaign highlighting the gap between Nikolic\u2019s rhetoric now and what he was saying a few years ago. Even in the last elections in 2008, Nikolic ran against Tadic on a nationalist pro-Russian and anti-EU platform. But he and his followers later broke with the Radicals and formed the avowedly pro-EU Progressive party, taking many former Radical voters with them. The initial results were a reversal of pre-election opinion polls that had shown both Nikolic and the Progressives slightly ahead of Tadic and his Democratic party, with voters penalizing the latter because of Serbia\u2019s poor economic performance. The focus in the campaign has been on the economy, with unemployment running at 24%, and lackluster growth last year of 1.6% expected to slow to about 0.5% this year. Serbs have also faced austerity measures to get public finances under control and could see more tight controls on spending if Serbia is to get a suspended IMF credit line back on track. But the focus on economic issues has been in contrast to previous elections that posed a starker choice between moving towards the EU or more nationalist and pro-Russian policies. Even if he finished second in the first round, pollsters had forecast Tadic might scrape to victory ahead of Nikolic in the second. The kingmaker could be Ivica Dacic, leader of the Socialists \u2013 Milosevic\u2019s former party \u2013 who might demand the job of prime minister as the price of supporting either candidate. Initial results put Dacic third in the presidential poll, on 14.6%. International peacekeepers in Kosovo, the former Serbian province that declared independence in 2008, were on high alert for possible clashes with the majority Albanian population as authorities allowed the Serbian minority there to vote in the elections. But the polls were reported to have passed without incident."

        "content": "An anti-government protest in Moscow turned violent Sunday, with some demonstrators clashing with police after they veered off their agreed-upon route. More than 250 people were arrested, including leading opposition figure Boris Nemtsov, leftist radical group leader Sergei Udaltsov and popular blogger Alexei Navalny, Moscow police told CNN. They were among the thousands that descended on the Russian capital for the latest demonstration denouncing Vladimir Putin, the nation\u2019s current prime minister who was recently elected to a six-year term as president. He is set to be inaugurated Monday. As they marched, many chanted slogans such as \u201cRussia without Putin\u201d and \u201cPutin is a thief.\u201d A large number of demonstrators did not follow the route to Bolotnaya Square that their leaders had agreed to with Moscow authorities, instead stopping in front of a line of police and refusing to move. Clashes broke out, with some protesters throwing various objects \u2013 including sticks and at least one flare \u2013 at police. Authorities responded by \u201cclubbing demonstrators\u201d who briefly broke through police lines, the state-run RIA-Novosti news agency reported. One of its correspondents saw \u201ca male protester out cold after clashing with officers,\u201d while another reported eight officers arresting one demonstrator \u201cfor the apparent crime of wearing a Guy Fawkes\u2019 mask,\u201d the symbol of the vigilante hacking group Anonymous.  Twenty officers were injured and three hospitalized in the clashes, according to RIA-Novosti, which added that those charged with assaulting police may face up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Itar-Tass, another official news agency, said four officers suffered cuts and wounds after having stones and bottles thrown at them and reporters. Police denied that they used tear gas as had been reported, according to RIA-Novosti.  After the arrests, authorities slowly moved forward and moved everyone out of the area. Many protesters expressed disappointment that the event was not peaceful, with some saying they were angry at those who they felt had provoked a confrontation with police. Others who faced off with authorities voiced frustration that previous peaceful rallies had done little to forward their political aims. In March, Putin won the country\u2019s presidential election with nearly 65% of the vote, claiming victory amid allegations by independent polling monitors of widespread electoral violations. International observers said there was legitimate uncertainty about the vote, with chess champion-turned opposition activist Garry Kasparov accusing Putin\u2019s supporters of \u201cmassive fraud.\u201d Putin, the former KGB officer who has worked to both stabilize Russia\u2019s economy and curtail dissent, held the presidency for eight years before term limits forced him to step down in 2008. His election followed a series of anti-Kremlin protests in the wake of disputed parliamentary elections that took place in December."

The win means that the 26-year-old has now tasted victory on every single Grand Prix track. More importantly the Honda rider now goes one point clear of his nearest rival after winning last week\u2019s Spanish MotoGP. Casey, who started on pole, led from front with the result never looking in doubt as Spaniard Jorge Lorenzo \u2013 who had led the series by four points - fruitlessly gave chase. Lorenzo did briefly threaten Stoner\u2019s dominance halfway through the race by moving to within striking distance. But Stoner held on and pulled away to a comfortable victory in much the same manor he secured victory in last weekend\u2019s Spanish MotoGP in Jerez. Stoner\u2019s Honda team Dani Pedrosa completed the podium finishing third.  It was another disappointing race for the American Yamaha rider Ben Spies, whose team set him a target of winning two races this season. But after a promising qualifying session on Saturday, where he secured fifth place on the starting grid, he eventually finished eighth. The MotoGP circus moves to France in two weeks time for the fourth race of the season at the famous Le Mans track. "

        "content": "Juventus secured their sensational return to the elite of Italian football after winning the league title with a regulation 2-0 victory over Cagliari. Goals from Mirko Vucinic and a Michele Canini own goal handed Juventus the advantage in the race for the Scudetto. But even though the Old Lady of Turin has gone unbeaten this season, their fate ultimately rested with events at the San Siro stadium where the Milan derby was kicking off simultaneously.  Holders Milan started the day one point behind Juve but knew they had to beat Inter to take the title chase to the final weekend.  What followed was one of the most memorable Milan derbies in recent years, as Inter ran out 4-2 winners with Diego Milito scoring a hat trick, the first person do so in this fixture in almost six decades. The victory handed Juventus title number 28.  Or so you would think. As fans invaded the pitch in Trieste, where Cagliari are currently playing their matches, some held banners aloft proclaiming the triumph to be Scudetto number 30.  That\u2019s because in 2006 the club was stripped of the two titles they won under former England coach Fabio Capello following a match fixing scandal that engulfed the club and saw them relegated to Serie B. It was a humiliating experience for one of world football\u2019s greatest clubs, but this season has seen something close to redemption, as the club has gone 37 games unbeaten under the reign of former Italian international Antonio Conte.  It is his first season in charge. The team celebrated wildly with the fans in Trieste, while the Rossoneri wondered what might have been in the San Siro.  A highly dubious first half penalty converted by Swedish international Zlatan Ibrahimovic had canceled out Milito\u2019s opener. Ibrahimovic, a former Juve player who has never been forgiven by the fans for leaving the club so soon after their relegation to Serie B, then gave Milan hope scoring his second 30 seconds after the start of the second half. But Inter powered forward, winning their own penalty converted by Milito to secure his hat trick, before Maicon scored a stunning fourth and sealed Juventus\u2019 return to where many believe they have always belonged.

        "content": "One of two Turkish journalists missing in Syria called home Saturday, ending nearly two months of speculation about their well-being but failing to clear up questions about who is holding them or when they might be freed. \u201cFor two months we didn\u2019t even know whether they were alive or dead so we had so many concerns and worries.  Now at least that has lifted,\u201d journalist Adem Ozkose\u2019s father, Mustafa Ozkose, told CNN. \u201cWe are so happy that it is impossible to explain in words.\u201d Ozkose, a reporter for the Turkish publications Gercek Hayat and freelance camerman Hamit Coskun went missing while filming a documentary. They were last heard from March 9, as they were traveling through Syria\u2019s troubled Idlib province on their way back to neighboring Turkey, Mustafa Ozkese said. Mustafa Ozkose said his son had less than three minutes Saturday to talk to his wife and ask about the welfare of his three children. \u201cHe said he was fine. He said that he missed his children,\u201d Mustafa Ozkose said. Humanitarian Relief Foundation, a Turkish Islamist charity group widely known by its Turkish acronym IHH, said it mediated the call. \u201cAs a result of negotiations that have been on going, an IHH diplomatic delegation was able to visit Adem Ozkose and Hamit Coskun where they were in Damascus and managed to have both Adem and Hamit make calls to their families,\u201d said Serkan Nergis, an IHH spokesman.   \u201cThis was a very positive step,\u201d he said.  A spokesman for the Turkish foreign ministry told CNN he had no official information about who is holding the men. Syrian officials have not answered formal requests by Turkey about whether the journalists were in government custody. Turkey withdrew its ambassador and diplomats from Damascus last March, as relations drastically deteriorated between the countries. IHH officials declined to give details about who is holding the two Turkish journalists in Damascus or what condition the men were in. \u201cThis is a very sensitive process,\u201d Nergis told CNN. \u201cFor now we cannot give further information about the two journalists\u2019 whereabouts or the process itself.\u201d But Nergis did say that the negotiations have been conducted in conjunction with Iran, which is a close ally of the Syrian government. In an April 23 statement, the group said it had worked with Iranian and Syrian counterparts to broker the release of two elderly Iranians who had been held by members of the Syrian opposition.  At the time, IHH publicly argued that the release of the Iranians would hopefully lead to the safe return of Ozkose and Coskun to Turkey. Throughout the anti-government uprising and bloody regime crackdown that have left more than 9,000 people dead, the Syrian government has for the most part prevented foreign journalists from freely entering the country. Turkish citizens do not need visas to travel to Syria. Nonetheless, the Syrian government has detained and deported a number of Turkish journalists who tried to work in the country. One group of reporters did not even make it past the airport before being sent back home. The tight restrictions have prompted numerous news organizations, including CNN, to smuggle reporters into Syria. According to a six-point peace plan brokered last month by the United Nations, Damascus pledged to allow foreign journalists into Syria.  However, news organizations, including CNN, are still being denied visas into the country. "

        "content": "After their heroics last Monday against hated city rivals Manchester United, Manchester City went one step closer to securing their first league title in four decades after beating Newcastle United 2-0.  Both second half goals came from Yaya Toure against a Newcastle side desperate for victory in a bid to secure third place, and with it a place in Europe\u2019s Champions League, the world\u2019s richest club competition. When the full time whistle was blown grown men wept in the stands as City\u2019s players celebrated knowing that, barring a miracle, this was going to be their year.  Those fans have witnessed a remarkable phoenix-like rise from the ashes.  Once the blue half of Manchester was the bigger of the two city teams. City once even relegated Manchester United on the last day of the 1973-1974 season. But whilst United went on to dominate the Premier League era, in 1996 Manchester City were relegated from the Premier League. Two years later they were relegated again, this time in to the third tier of English football.  That proved to be rock bottom as City eventually fought their way back to become Premier League regulars.  It was the purchase of the club in 2008 by the royal family of Abu Dhabi that transformed City from an average team with a glorious past into the richest football club in the world.  Hundreds of millions of dollars was spent on players like Toure, secured from Barcelona, Sergio Aguero and Carlos Tevez.  Before the game both Manchester teams were on 83 points, with City ahead on goal difference, the closest title race in Premier League history. And it looked like Newcastle United was about to hand Manchester United advantage in the title fight as coach Alan Pardew\u2019s side held City at bay for the first 70 minutes. The match turned on a piece of tactical genius by Manchester City coach Roberto Mancini who brought on Dutch midfielder Nigel De Jong and pushed Toure forward. Yet after the game Mancini remained cautious on his side\u2019s title hopes.  \u201cI think it\u2019s not enough because we have another difficult game (against QPR),\u201d Mancini told British TV network Sky Sports.   \u201cI think we deserved to win this game today.\u201d  Later on Sunday Manchester United took on Swansea City at a subdued Old Trafford knowing that defeat would virtually hand City the title. Two first half goals for Paul Scholes and Ashley Young gave United hope that they could score enough goals to make a dent in City\u2019s superior goal difference but the match finished 2-0.  Now the season moves on to the final day of the season with City taking on QPR, who will need to win to guarantee they stay in the Premier League after their promotion last season, whilst United travel to Sunderland knowing they could win, finish the season on equal points and still lose the title. Both sides of Manchester will endure one final, tortuous 90 minutes to decide the fate of this season\u2019s Premier League trophy. "

        "content": "Francois Hollande defeated French President Nicolas Sarkozy in a presidential runoff Sunday, signaling a shift to the left as the country and Europe fight to dig out of a weak economy. In a victory speech to supporters in Tulle, Hollande declared his win \u201ca great date for our country, and a new start for Europe.\u201d The Socialist challenger promised to govern for all of France. \u201cMany people have been waiting for this moment for many long years. Others, younger, have never known such a time. \u2026 I am proud to be capable to bring about hope again,\u201d he told the cheering crowd. \u201cTonight, there are not two Frances. \u2026 There is only one France, only one nation that is united with the same destiny,\u201d Hollande said. The president-elect, who will be the nation\u2019s first left-wing president since Francois Mitterrand left office in 1995, suggested there was a sense of relief in many European countries because of his win. \u201cAusterity can no longer be something that is inevitable,\u201d he said. Later, Hollande went to Paris, where he addressed a large crowd at the Bastille. Supporters waved flags and shouted his name. \u201cI know what many people feel \u2013 years and years of wounds, of ruptures, and we have to repair, recover, unite. That is what we\u2019re going to do together,\u201d he vowed. Hollande congratulated Sarkozy, who earlier conceded to Hollande as results from exit polls and official tallies in the runoff election came in. \u201cI carry the entire responsibility for this defeat, and I\u2019m going to say why. I fought for the values of responsibility, and I\u2019m not a man who does not accept his responsibilities,\u201d Sarkozy said from his Paris campaign headquarters, as members of the crowd shouted, \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m ready to become a French person amongst French people, and more than ever I have the love for my country deeply ingrained in my heart,\u201d Sarkozy said. With almost all of the votes counted, Hollande was leading with 51.6% to Sarkozy\u2019s 48.4%, the nation\u2019s Interior Ministry said. Voter turnout was reported at more than 80%. Exit polls said Hollande won 51.9% of the vote, France 2 television reported. Crowds roared at the center-left candidate\u2019s campaign headquarters as the exit poll results came out Sunday evening. Celebratory car horns blared along the Champs-Elysees in Paris. \u201cIt\u2019s a great night, full of joy for so many young people all across the country,\u201d said Thierry Marchal-Beck, president of the Movement of Young Socialists. U.S. President Barack Obama called Hollande shortly after results were in to congratulate the newly elected president and invite him to the White House. Sarkozy had fought to keep his job amid a wave of discontent over his inability to rein in unemployment. He defended his economic record despite low growth and unemployment at about 10%, saying the impact of Europe\u2019s debt crisis could have been far worse. France is a key player in plans to lead the eurozone out of its debt crisis, making the election vital to the region.   Sarkozy\u2019s defeat marks the latest \u2013 and most significant \u2013 of at least half a dozen European leaders swept from office during the eurozone economic crisis, including the Greek and Italian prime ministers. France\u2019s vote came the same day as the Greek parliamentary election. Exit polls in that country indicated Greece\u2019s ruling coalition appeared headed for steep losses, while parties on the far left and far right were poised to make significant gains amid anger over austerity measures. Hollande and Sarkozy traded insults last week in the only televised head-to-head debate of the campaign. Sarkozy labeled Hollande a liar and a \u201clittle slanderer,\u201d while Hollande accused the president of shirking his responsibilities, cronyism and favoring the privileged over France\u2019s poor. Both candidates reached out to France\u2019s undecided voters since the first-round vote on April 22 left them the only two standing.  Centrist Francois Bayrou, who took 9% of the first round vote, delivered a boost to Hollande\u2019s campaign Thursday when he said he would vote for the Socialist and urged his supporters to vote according to their conscience. Sarkozy has been president since 2007."

        "content": "Voters dealt major blows to Greece\u2019s two most established parties in parliamentary elections Sunday, leaving no party with anything approaching a majority and the politically and economically volatile nation even more in flux. With 97% of votes counted early Monday by the Interior Ministry, the right-leaning New Democracy \u2013 part of the present ruling coalition \u2013 finished first with 19% support to capture 109 seats. That figure is barely half the percentage that it won in elections in 2009 and well short of what party leader Antonis Samaras admitted it hoped for entering this weekend. \u201cI asked for a strong mandate, but people chose differently. I respect their message,\u201d Samaras said in remarks carried live on state television. \u201cToday\u2019s result expresses people\u2019s disappointment towards the implemented dead-end economic policy that tested their limits and didn\u2019t include the necessary development policy.\u201d In an apparent backlash against austerity measures, no party came close to a majority, and the two parties that spearhead the current coalition government earned far short of 50% of all 300 parliamentary seats. That means a new coalition government will again have to be formed.  Politicians have until May 17 to come up with a new working alliance or, if they cannot, set a date for another round of elections.  Samaras acknowledged the results were disappointing to his party, but said that as the first-place finisher and \u201conly pillar of political stability in Greece,\u201d New Democracy now has even more responsibility. If a coalition government can be formed, he said its two priorities would be to remain in the eurozone and alter existing policies, including stringent austerity measures, to \u201cachieve development and offer people relief.\u201d \u201cI understand people\u2019s rage, but I will not let the country (exist) without a government,\u201d Samaras said. The other party to see its support plummet was left-leaning PASOK, New Democracy\u2019s coalition partner. Three years after beating out all other parties with 44% of the vote, PASOK took 13.3% this time \u2013 giving it 41 spots in parliamentary, compared to 160 after the previous election. PASOK\u2019s leader, Evangelos Venizelos, said in a speech carried on state TV that he favored the formation of a unity government that is \u201cEU-oriented, regardless of what their take is on\u201d previously implemented measures. The tribulations of New Democracy and PASOK were matched by triumphs of a number of other parties that were also-rans and in some cases nonexistent just a few years ago, propelled by voters angry about stringent austerity measures. Elections in Europe: Socialist wins French presidency The radical leftist coalition Syriza passed PASOK with a strong second-place showing. Exit polls predicted it would garner 10% support, but instead Syriza garnered 16.7% support, according to the all-but-final results. That more than triples its parliamentary representation to 51 seats. \u201cThis is a message of a peaceful revolution,\u201d said Syriza party leader Alexis Tsipras. \u201cEuropean leadership and especially (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel have to understand that austerity policies have suffered defeat.\u201d The fourth-place finisher, the Independent Greek party, was founded in February by ousted New Democracy parliamentarian Panos Kammenos. With 10.6% backing, this right-wing nationalist party, which opposes Greece\u2019s agreement with the European Union and International Monetary Fund, will now have 33 seats in parliament. The Communist Party, which wants Greece to leave the single-currency eurozone, also saw gains in winning 8.5% support. And the far-right Golden Dawn party, which got 0.3% of votes the previous election, ended up with 7% support on Sunday. That equates to rise from zero to 21 parliamentary seats. Its leader, Nikos Michaloliakos, gave a rousing speech after Sunday\u2019s vote saying Golden Dawn would \u201cfight so that Greece won\u2019t be a slave of the memorandum and of the social jungle that illegal immigrants have brought in this country.\u201d \u201cEveryone who betrays Hellenism should be afraid. We are coming,\u201d he said. Katerina Sokou, financial editor of the Greek daily newspaper Kathimerini, called what happened Sunday \u201ca protest vote (against) the main two political parties of Greece.\u201d Yet Sokou added that she expects New Democracy and PASOK again will be part of the ruling coalition government, even though there may be notable policy changes and challenges to come, including a \u201crenegotiation\u201d of already approved austerity measures. \u201cI believe that these electoral results \u2026 show that people need a coalition government,\u201d she said. \u201cThey also want the parties to cooperate.\u201d One young mother interviewed by CNN said her aim Sunday, before the voters were counted, was to \u201cpunish\u201d pro-austerity politicians and \u201cget rid of them for good.\u201d Austerity is \u201cthe wrong path,\u201d said the woman, who did not give her name.  \u201cAusterity measures just make people poorer and the situation does not get any better in the long term or in the short term either,\u201d she said. But another voter at the same polling station said politicians have been doing the right thing. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an alternative,\u201d he said, saying he backed \u201cwhichever party actually understands that and wants to deal with it and wants to take these hard measures.\u201d He also did not give his name. The country\u2019s national debt threatened to force it to drop Europe\u2019s common currency, the euro, prompting the European Central Bank and other lenders to swoop in with emergency funding last year. In exchange, they demanded that the government slash spending brutally. Austerity measures already enacted have led to cuts in jobs, wages, pensions and benefits, and have negatively affected many people, especially pensioners and those who get state assistance. Taxes have gone up and the national unemployment rate for January, the latest month for which figures are available, was just under 22%. Among 25- to 34-year-olds, it was nearly 29%, leading many young people to leave the country in search of work. Furthermore, for the past two years, the country\u2019s massive amount of debt has threatened the stability of the 17-country eurozone. Greece pushed through a huge debt swap in March to save it from disorderly default and clear the way for it to receive a second bailout from the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, worth \u20ac130 billion ($171.5 billion). The debt restructuring deal gave some breathing space to the eurozone bloc, where fears that Greece might collapse had increased pressure on other debt-laden nations such as Spain and Italy. But the outcome of Sunday\u2019s vote raises fresh questions as to whether Greece will stick with the painful path of austerity."

The three-time world player of the year paid the ultimate tribute to Josep Guardiola in the coach\u2019s final home game, which ended in a 4-0 victory over city rivals Espanyol. The Argentina forward went into the match having already broken Gerd Muller\u2019s longstanding record of 67 goals in a European season, and he took his tally to an incredible 72 ahead of next weekend\u2019s closing league game at Real Betis. Fifty of those have come in La Liga, putting him five clear of Ronaldo \u2013 who also scored in Saturday\u2019s 2-1 win at Granada that kept Real seven points clear of Barca. It was an emotional night at the Camp Nou, where Guardiola said farewell to the fans he has enthralled with his team\u2019s magical style of football since taking over in 2008. \u201cI\u2019ll see you all soon, you will never lose me. I will miss you all very much. I\u2019m the one on the losing end,\u201d he told the crowd.

Thank you all.\u201d Messi opened the scoring in the 12th minute with a superb free-kick, then his second-half treble was aided by two penalties either side of a trademark low left-foot drive. Ronaldo, who topped the La Liga scoring charts last season with a then record 40 goals, was also on target from the spot as Madrid came from behind to snatch victory. Granada, battling to avoid relegation, led through Franco Jara in the fifth minute,  but the world\u2019s most expensive player leveled in the 81st minute after being brought down in the box. Then, in time added on, David Cortes diverted Karim Benzema\u2019s cross into his own net to give Real the chance to finish the season on 100 points with victory next Sunday.  Valencia guaranteed third place \u2013 29 points behind Barca \u2013 with a 1-0 win over Villarreal, who face a final-day fight to avoid dropping into the bottom three. Malaga\u2019s bid for fourth place suffered a blow with a 2-1 defeat at Atletico Madrid, who are now two points adrift in fifth. Levante and Mallorca are another point back after the latter side won their clash 1-0. Second-bottom Sporting Gijon could still survive after a 2-1 win over Betis left the club three points adrift of Zaragoza and Vallecano. "

        "content": "What started out as Chelsea\u2019s worst season since owner Roman Abramovich arrived in 2003 is now on the verge of becoming one of the English club\u2019s best. Saturday\u2019s FA Cup final success, the London side\u2019s fourth in six years in the world\u2019s oldest football competition, is the latest step in a revival that could end in the realization of the Russian billionaire\u2019s longheld dream. The nailbiting 2-1 victory at Wembley is but a tasty precursor to a Champions League final in Munich on May 19 that offers the chance for Abramovich to finally win Europe\u2019s top club prize. He brought Premier League success to Stamford Bridge in 2005 after spending millions on coach Jose Mourinho and a swathe of star players, achieving Chelsea\u2019s first English title in 50 years. Two more followed, but not before Mourinho departed after failing to repeat the European triumph at Porto that earned Abramovich\u2019s attention  \u2013 and Avram Grant, Luiz Felipe Scolari and Carlo Ancelotti also exited as Champions League success proved elusive. Andre Villas-Boas, \u201cthe new Mourinho,\u201d was bought out of his contract at Porto to replace Ancelotti \u2013 a European champion as both player and coach \u2013 but the Portuguese prodigy alienated Chelsea\u2019s powerful old guard of players as he sought to stamp his authority and rebuild the squad. His assistant Roberto di Matteo, a former Chelsea player himself, has had no such problems winning their respect as he has reverted to the style so successful under Mourinho, allowing the likes of veterans Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba to restore their pre-eminent roles in the team. Drogba scored the vital winner in the first leg of the remarkable Champions League semifinal success against arguably the world\u2019s best team, Barcelona, and he netted the ultimately decisive second goal against Liverpool.  The 34-year-old Ivory Coast captain is now the only player to score in four FA Cup finals, equaling the five goals in total scored by legendary Liverpool striker Ian Rush in three title matches. Drogba may yet make his Chelsea exit after the Bayern Munich clash in two weeks\u2019 time \u2013 a match which not only holds the key to Abramovich\u2019s hopes, but could also be part of a solution to the challenges the club faces under European soccer\u2019s new financial fair play rules. Each team will get a reported $66 million for making the final, when television money is added to the prize total on offer, representing a major budgetary boost for a club like Chelsea \u2013 which under the new regulations can no longer rely on Abramovich\u2019s deep pockets. Chelsea\u2019s bid to become more financially self-sufficient took another step ahead of Saturday\u2019s final, with news the club is seeking to buy the nearby iconic Battersea power station and turn it into a new home ground with capacity greater than the present one. The $2.9 million earned by winning the FA Cup final for the seventh time will also help, as well as furthering the prospects of Di Matteo being made Chelsea\u2019s permanent manager. Brazil midfielder Ramires followed up his second-leg goal against Barcelona with the opening strike in the 11th minute as he beat goalkeeper Pepe Reina at the near post with a low shot. Drogba doubled the lead seven minutes after halftime, but Liverpool substitute Andy Carroll ensured a nervy finish after reducing the deficit on 64. The striker \u2013 who has struggled since joining Liverpool for a club-record $50 million fee in January 2011 after Fernando Torres left for Chelsea for $30 million more than that \u2013 thought he had leveled the scores with a late header. However, Chelsea keeper Petr Cech clawed the ball clear off the underside of the crossbar apparently before it had crossed the line \u2013 much to the disgust of Liverpool striker Luis Suarez, who was booked for remonstrating with the line official. \u201cWe\u2019ve been heavily criticised this season and we\u2019ve got a trophy and we\u2019ve got the chance for another,\u201d said Di Matteo, who scored in two FA Cup final wins for Chelsea in 1997 and 2000.  \u201cThis group of players have made the club proud. It\u2019s been hard work, but we came through it.\u201d Liverpool will play in Europe next season, albeit the second-tier Europa League after winning the League Cup in February, but it has been an otherwise disappointing season under manager Kenny Dalglish. The 18-time English champions trail sixth-placed Chelsea by 12 points with two games to play in the Premier League, a situation which cannot please the club\u2019s American owners \u2013 who are looking to emulate the success they have had with baseball\u2019s Boston Red Sox. \u201cThey were better than us for the first hour,\u201d Dalglish said after the final. \u201cWe finished really strong and if we\u2019d started the way we\u2019d finished we\u2019d maybe have been happier than we are now. We\u2019ve just got to learn the lessons.\u201d Abramovich\u2019s hopes of Champions League football next season, meanwhile, appear to rest solely on victory in Munich, despite a slip-up by third-placed London rivals Arsenal on Saturday. Arsenal\u2019s 3-3 draw with Norwich gave Tottenham and Newcastle the chance to move up to third and fourth with victories on Sunday. Spurs, who hold the edge on goal difference only, face relegation-threatened Aston Villa while the in-form Magpies will seek to follow up Wednesday\u2019s 2-0 win over Chelsea with another result against league leaders Manchester City. Both clubs are five points clear of Chelsea, but know that the fourth-placed team will be bumped down to the Europa League if Abramovich gets what he really wants in Germany. City returned to the top on goal difference with a 1-0 win in Monday\u2019s Manchester derby, but second-placed local rivals United have easier opposition on Sunday as the defending champions host mid-table Swansea.

        "content": "Borussia Dortmund capped a second successive title-winning season by setting a new Bundesliga points record in the final round of matches on Saturday. Jurgen Klopp\u2019s team thrashed Freiburg 4-0 to finish on 81 points from 34 games, equaling second-placed Bayern Munich\u2019s record of 25 victories in a campaign. Dortmund, having wrapped up a fifth title overall with two rounds remaining, extended the club\u2019s unbeaten league run to 28 matches as Jakub Blaszczykowski and Robert Lewandowski \u2013 hoping to star for co-hosts Poland in the upcoming Euro 2012 finals \u2013 both scored twice in the first half. It gave the club six more points than last season, and maintained momentum ahead of the German Cup final against Bayern on May 12.  Striker Lewandowski ended with 22 league goals, putting him four behind Bayern\u2019s Mario Gomez and seven adrift of Schalke\u2019s leading Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. Bayern hold most Bundesliga milestones, including that of 21 titles, but the Bavarians lost their mantle of 79 points achieved twice in the 1970s \u2013 an equivalent figure, as a win in those days earned only two points not the current three. However, Jupp Heynckes\u2019 team ended the Bundesliga season on a high with a 4-1 away win that condemned second-bottom Cologne to the second division \u2013 and Bayern still have the prospect of European success in the Champions League final against English club Chelsea in Munich on May 19. Gomez could not add to his tally, but fellow Germany international Thomas Muller netted twice and Dutch winger Arjen Robben scored his 12th league goal this season as Bayern finished nine points clear of third-placed Schalke. Cologne farewelled the top flight and 18-goal striker Lukas Podolski, who is moving to English club Arsenal after playing for Germany at Euro 2012. Dutch striker Huntelaar consolidated his position as the league\u2019s top scorer with two more goals as Schalke won 3-2 at Werder Bremen. Schalke had already clinched Germany\u2019s final automatic Champions League place last weekend, and will be joined in Europe\u2019s top club competition by Borussia Monchengladbach. Gladbach will play in the qualifying rounds after finishing six points clear of fifth-placed Bayer Leverkusen, beating Mainz 3-0 as Dortmund-bound Marco Reus scored twice and set up another goal. The 22-year-old, who will rejoin the club he played for as a youth after Euro 2012, finished the season with 18 league goals alongside Lewandowski and Bremen\u2019s Claudio Pizarro \u2013 who also scored twice against Schalke. Leverkusen will play in the second-tier Europa League after closing with a 4-1 win at Nuremberg \u2013 in which striker Stefan Kiessling scored a hat-trick to finish on 16 goals, and former Germany captain Michael Ballack made his final appearance for the club. Stuttgart consolidated sixth with a 3-2 win over Wolfsburg, who missed out on the final European place as Hanover took seventh with a 2-1 win over bottom team Kaiserslautern.  Hertha Berlin avoided automatic relegation by beating Hoffenheim 3-1 to move out of the bottom two, but must now take on a second division club \u2013 either Fortuna Dusseldorf, SC Paderborn or St. Pauli \u2013 in a two-leg playoff."

        "content": "It\u2019s been three years since Tommy Haas has reached an ATP Tour final, and the former world No. 2\u2019s wait for a 13th career title was extended on Saturday. The 34-year-old rolled back the years on home soil this week when he stunned top seed Jo Wilfried-Tsonga at the Munich Open, but his tournament has now ended with a straight-sets defeat by 2010 runner-up Marin Cilic in the semifinals. Haas, who has overcome two career-threatening injuries in the past decade, was runner-up in the clay event in 2000 and had been on course to reach his first final since winning another German tournament, the Halle grass-court championship in 2009. But Croatian Cilic triumphed 6-3 6-4 as he won 89% of his service points to set up a clash with Germany\u2019s Philipp Kohlschreiber on Sunday.  \u201cIt was my best match of the week,\u201d the 23-year-old third seed told the ATP website after beating a player who has reached four grand slam semifinals but needed a wild-card to enter this week.  \u201cI played and served extremely well. I believe he didn\u2019t reach deuce on my serve. Tommy played really well this week and I went into the match with thoughts of that. It made good preparation for everything.\u201d  Haas had also defeated former Australian Open finalist Marco Baghdatis on his way to the last four, but the world No. 134 lost in 75 minutes to a man seeking to win an ATP Tour title for the fourth successive year, owning six overall. Kohlschreiber, the 2007 Munich champion, will also be seeking his seventh title after beating Spanish second seed Feliciano Lopez in the second semifinal. The 28-year-old, who has also been a winner and runner-up at Halle, won 6-2 6-7 (4-7) 6-4. In Portugal, Kaia Kanepi won her second WTA Tour title by beating Spain\u2019s Carla Suarez Navarro 3-6 7-6 (8-6) 6-4 in Saturday\u2019s final of the Estoril Open. The Estonian sixth seed had a six-week injury layoff after her maiden victory in Brisbane in January, but has battled back after losing first-round matches in Miami and Indian Wells. In the men\u2019s event, defending champion Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina will play French second seed Richard Gasquet in Sunday\u2019s final. In Belgrade, Italian second seed Andreas Seppi will take on France\u2019s Benoit Paire in Sunday\u2019s final of the Serbia Open. Seppi beat Argentine fourth seed David Nalbandian, while in another three-set match Paire upset Spaniard Pablo Andujar \u2013 who was top seed in the absence of defending champion Novak Djokovic, who is mourning the recent death of his grandfather.

        "content": "More than 40,000 people are expected to attend the official opening of the Olympic Stadium for the 2012 Games in east London on Saturday. Dozens of celebrities are also taking part in the event, dubbed \u201c2,012 Hours to Go,\u201d which begins at 7 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET). Two of Britain\u2019s most celebrated Olympians, rower Sir Steve Redgrave and swimmer Mark Foster, will be among those present to mark the venue\u2019s official opening. The spectators will watch the last 90 minutes of an athletics championship for British university students, a test event held at the stadium. Some of the country\u2019s best athletes will then take part in invitational events, the organizers said. The sporting events will be followed by a series of stunts, games and competitions involving celebrities and athletes, including a bicycle relay challenge and \u201czorbing,\u201d where people roll around inside giant transparent plastic balls. One member of the audience will win the chance to officially open the stadium. Seb Coe, chairman of organizing committee for the London Olympics, said it was an important milestone in the runup to the Games, now less than three months away. \u201cSeeing athletes on the track for the first time will be a special moment for me personally, and then welcoming 40,000 people into the Stadium on Saturday night will be a major milestone,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis crowd will not only be starting their Olympic journey just weeks ahead of the Games, they will also play a vital role in helping us test the venue and earn our license to operate the Stadium.\u201d Those arriving at the four entrances to the Olympic Park will pass through airport-style security, with metal detectors and bag scanners in operation. The stadium will host the four opening and closing ceremonies for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, as well as many of the events. With waterways on three sides, spectators will access the 80,000 capacity stadium via five bridges. The structure was built using 10,000 tons of steel, considerably less than for other Olympic stadiums, the organizers say, and with an emphasis on sustainability.  Construction began in May 2008 and was completed in March 2011, when the final piece of turf was laid."

        "content": "Voters in Greece prepared Saturday to take part in parliamentary elections, with wide uncertainty over what government will emerge from Sunday\u2019s vote and how it will handle the austerity crisis gripping the nation. No party is expected to win a majority of the vote, meaning a coalition will again have to be formed. The outgoing coalition government pushed through a series of painful austerity measures in order to secure emergency bailout funding for Greece, which is at the center of the eurozone debt crisis. The two main parties which formed that coalition in November, PASOK and New Democracy, are expected to lose votes to a raft of smaller parties, as people express their unhappiness at their country\u2019s economic plight. Campaigning came to a close on Friday. Evangelos Venizelos, leader of the left-leaning PASOK party, declared \u201ceverything is at stake Sunday,\u201d as he addressed a final campaign rally in the capital\u2019s central Syntagma Square, scene of many anti-austerity protests. Voters have a choice, he said, to \u201cremain in the eurozone and follow a difficult yet safe path\u201d that will help the country get through the austerity measures \u2013 or to follow \u201ca dangerous path that can take us 20 years back, lead the country to bankruptcy and Greeks to massive poverty.\u201d Antonis Samaras, leader of the right-leaning New Democracy party, urged voters to swing behind his party at a rally in Athens on Thursday. He called for \u201ca strong mandate to change everything \u2026 I don\u2019t want to rule jointly with PASOK and it is not in the interest of the Greek people for such a joint governance to take place.\u201d Opinion polls suggest New Democracy will take about a fifth of the vote, with Pasok a few points behind. Far right parties are among the fringe groups expected to benefit from voters\u2019 disillusionment with the two biggest parties\u2019 backing for austerity measures. Opinion polls suggest the extreme right Golden Dawn, an ultra-nationalist party which blames immigrants for many of Greece\u2019s problems, may take more than 5% of the vote and so claim seats in parliament. Two years ago, it commanded only 0.28% support. Some members of the party have been linked with violent extremism. Another far right party, LAOS, could take about 3% of the vote. Parties on the other end of the political spectrum may also win greater support. Surveys indicate SYRIZA, the Coalition of the Radical Left, could take just over 10% of the vote, with the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), which wants Greece to leave the single currency eurozone, close behind. KKE leader Aleka Papariga told supporters Wednesday that the debate over whether or not Greece should stay in the eurozone was pointless. \u201cWithout a radical political change, a large section of the people will be fully bankrupted,\u201d she warned. While the mainstream parties are still expected to win a greater share of the vote, the rise of fringe parties has had an impact on campaigning. In a gesture to right wing concerns, for example, New Democracy has promised to be much tougher on illegal immigration if elected. While his party backed the bailout deal, Samaras has said it doesn\u2019t allow enough scope for growth and wants to push through further privatization and cuts to public sector waste.  The austerity measures have already led to cuts in jobs, wages, pensions and benefits and have badly affected many people, especially pensioners and those needing state help. Taxes have gone up and unemployment is high, leading many young people to leave the country to seek work elsewhere. The country\u2019s massive pile of debt has threatened the stability of the 17-country eurozone during a crisis which has dragged on for almost two years. Greece pushed through a huge debt swap in March to save it from disorderly default and clear the way to receive its second bailout from the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, worth \u20ac130 billion ($171.5 billion). The debt restructuring deal gave some breathing space to the euro zone bloc, where fears that Greece might collapse had increased pressure on other debt-laden nations such as Spain and Italy. But the outcome of Sunday\u2019s vote will be closely watched to see if Greece is able to stick with the painful path of austerity. "
